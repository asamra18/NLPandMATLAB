8,"I have generally had very good experience ordering jewelry from Amazon sellers, so I ordered two of these necklace pendants, one for myself and one for my mother. Both arrived with very badly tarnished chains (about half the chain rust colored on both). In addition, the actual pendants were scratched and ""used looking"".

59,"I ordered a black titanium barbell. Once i recieved it, not even a day later black paint was chipping off my ""titanium ring."" Obviously the ring wasn't titanium, but painted steel, manipulatinf titanium.

60,"I had ordered this for my girlfriends birthday, her birthstone being amethyst i thought i was getting a good deal on a nice piece. I was wrong. The stones have very VERY little purple in them, and frankly it just looks very cheaply made. And that is not the worst of it. When i was opening the box i could hear something jangling around, it turned out to be one of the stones that had already fallen out of the bracelet. I WILL be returning this item and i urge you the customer not to waste your time here.

83,"I really am confused in why this item got so many positive reviews?! Perhaps I just got a dud?! Blue topaz is my birhtstone, and seeing the size of these, I thought these would be the perfect kind of earrings to put in and forget about....Mind you, I own many blue topaz pieces...but these were barely blue at all! And the silver pieces in between the stones? Well, it just blended the stones in even more to a washed out faded look! Seriously, I couldnt even tell these were blue topaz.Unfortunately, these went back. I wanted blue topaz, not some pale whitish stones...

205,"I was very disappointed with this ring. I plan on returning it. Looks nothing like the picture. I would have been better off buying something similar at the teen jewelry store at the local mall. Totally over priced not worth it at all.

220,"I ordered the size I usually wear but it was too small and I did not rec,info.on how to exchange.

222,"It looked like aluminum foil up against my engagement ring. I am not satisfied as I wanted it to be a temporary wedding band till i get a real one. But I can say by it's self it's cute. It could look real on a finger by itself.

253,"Hasn't broken or anything, but made the hole really red and sore and I've had the piercing for YEARs!

265,"The quality of this item was not up to expectations.The Top was scratched, the hinges did not line up to the pre-drilled holes and the staining was inconsistant. If I saw this item in a store I would not have purchased it.

295,"I got a lackluster and marginally impersonal response from this company when I wrote in and asked them if they'd accidentally sent me a child-size toe ring. I'd never received one so tiny before or had this issue at all via amazon, let alone brick & mortar jewelry stores. It is a pain to adjust, and will slip off adjusting it to the size of my other toe rings when they're not extended whatsoever. That was my cue that I wasn't imagining the discrepancy lol it's painful to keep on when adjusted to the point that it won't slip off. Save your $ unless you're buying it for a toddler. If you extend it so it fits your smallest, normal-sized adult toe, it will fall off. If you tighten it enough so that it will stay on, you can't walk. Someone in eve'saddiction manufacturing dropped the ball somewhere

297,"This brooch is far too small and expensive for its size. I was shocked when I pulled it out of its pouch. May I iterate, it is far too small. Without a moment's hesitation this brooch was immediately returned.

307,"I don't actually own the product, but I happened to notice something wrong. The title of the product is ""Midnight Gem LEO Zodiac Sign Dangle Belly Ring"". This is what I noticed: The symbol isn't Leo, it's Taurus! The sellers of this product needs to rename it ""Midnight Gem TAURUS Zodiac Sign Dangle Belly Ring.

352,"Very pretty looking but I wore it twice and stones (yes more than one) have fallen out never to be seen again. Waste of money.
",1
360,"I'm not sure why everyone is raving about this. My girlfriend bought this and she was highly disappointed. The metal is very thin and cheap....the stone is also fairly cloudy and it's HIGHLY apparent it's fake. This ring should be priced more like $2.99.
",1
362,"I own a 1 ct. real diamond and puchased this ring for fun while my ring was being serviced. This ring is about 2.5- 3 carats. From afar, this ring may look real but it looks very fake close up. The setting is poorly constructed and looks like you'd get it from claire's. The stone is sparkly but the color looks like it is a cubic zirconia. I'm almost too embarrased to wear it because it looks so fake. For those reviewers that stated the ring was ""gorgeous"" and ""looks real"", they clearly don't have diamond experience. Maybe I'm a snob, but don't get his ring thinking it'll pass off as real. Think about it like this.... what you pay for is what you get. If you pay $18.99 for a ring, it'll look like an $18.99 ring.

379,"Ok so I wanted a ring that could replace my wedding ring till I could get a new one and fell in love with this one till it was sent to me. It looks like a dollar store ring! its cheap looking and I was very disappointed. The one thing that was good about this product is that it was in my mailbox within 2 days of ordering it!

406,"When I ordered this locket, I expected to receive a beautiful, antique-looking locket, that looked the same in the picture as it did in my hand. I was extremely disappointed. The locket itself is made of cheap, thin metal. The ""antique"" effect is just black paint in the creases. It appears as if the locket was dipped in motor oil, but not thoroughly cleaned. The chain is almost as bad. It is very bulky, much larger than it looks in the picture. AND the chain broke seconds after I got it out of the package (although the package was quite nice). To prospective buyers, don't waste your money. This necklace belongs in the garbage can, end of story.
",1
449,"I was really disappointed with the product. It is to thin and the chain turns a dark color after a few wears. I have only had this item for 3 weeks and have had to clean it four (4) times already. Would not recommend it for purchase.
",1
478,"These bracelets are so flimsy, skinny that they bend before you can even put them on. At first it seemed like good value, but they are not worth even $200.00 that I paid for each. Spend more to get something that doesn't collapse.
",1
505,"The produce got to me in good time, very good shape and the item was so well liked by the person I gave it too.I will order from this Company again.
",1
507,"It is painful. The head of the seahorse digs into the skin because of the length of the bar, and shape of the head.
",1
541,"This product was much larger than the picture showed. Also, It only would have fit a man's finger. It was almost scary looking and not represented well on line.
",1
550,"This product advertised as 'one size fits all' was too small. I returned it and they send me another. Also too small.
",1
558,"This is a nice bracelet. I would order it, but you have to tack on an extra 7.95 for shipping. not worth it when I can just go to Macy's and buy it for around 15 bucks.
",1
566,"This ring got broken the first week I use it. It's a weak ring that is know not useful. I paid for nothing. The stone was clear, it did not have a blue color and it was not a blue topaz.

587,"ordered this spider, never came in the mail...contacted seller and said one was on the way....never came.

606,"I'm used to the malleability of pewter, but this was ridiculous. Bent all-to-hell just from normal wear. Wouldn't suggest to a friend.
",1
620,"I just hate this product and ill tell u why. For starters its to flimsy it bends way to easly. After a few days from having it it stareted to get a hair line crack right next to the wolf. I wore it to dinner with my husband and it got snaged on my purse when i was geting something out and it just bent all the way back and snaped off. This pruduct suxs and im glad they arnt selling this awfull thing no more. I would not recomend it to no one. and yes this product does have a beautifull wolf on it but its just not a good sturdy metal.
",1
627,"I was very disappointed in the ring. The color is grey not sterling bright. I was looking for the somerset mesh ring but it was not available in size 9 so ordered this one which looked the same but was NOT i plan to return the ring.

685,"I purchased this necklace for my daughter, having her first child. Gave it to her at her baby shower on Nov.3. It brought tears,she loved it so much. A month later she had to purchase a new chain for it. Last week the cameo came out of the rim, she barely tried to push it back in and it broke in half. It lasted almost 2 months, not counting the chain. It was something she wanted to keep for a lifetime. So disappointed!!!!!
",1
714,"not what i needed in size (too small for all the jewelry my granddaughter like to carry with her most of the times
",1
762,"If the seller had been specific about the size of this item, it would have eliminated the need of returning it. And MADE IN CHINA stamped on the back of it? -- REALLY !

775,"these earrings do not lay right. It looked like I was taking off from outer space!!!!
",1
797,"I ordered these earrings for my 10 year old granddaughter and when they arrived I was very disappointed in how tiny they were. They were very pretty but very small.
",1
805,"I bought this navel ring awhile ago with clear crystals I thought it was cute and I liked how it is movable. Unfortunately only a couple days after wearing it one jewel fell out, and shortly after that another one fell out too. So I stopped wearing it altogether. I also bought another belly ring from the same company and that one began to tarnish quickly, So I don't think I will be taking any more chances ordering from this company any more.
",1
806,"I ordered 3 items. This necklace came to me with a nasty kink and a ring that had a dent in it.I had to send it back paying for the shipping handling......so I paid for the initial shipping and handling as well as the shipping and handling to send it backThis company is ripping off consumers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

834,"When I opened the box I actually thought they forgot to include the pendant in with the chain. Then inside a tiny piece of tissue paper was a microscopic pendant. Considering I just purchased a cross from Ireland twenty times the size of this for only $20 more, you know this is going back. This is even too tiny for an infant.

868,"I had purchase this as a gift for my wife on Mother's day. I recieved it in a timely manner. It came in a little bag and when I pulled it out it was in one big knot. I am still trying to this day to get the knot out, which means my wife still has not be able to wear it. I would not recommend this product from this vender until they can ensure it gets to you undamaged.
",1
888,"I found these cufflinks to be poor quality and barely resembling the photo in the listing. The silver tone film had bubbles on the face of the piece, the craftmanship was rough and inprecise. Overall, I was quite dissapointed. The vendor handled the return satisfactorily, promptly and courteously.
",1
890,"These broke almost immediately after purchasing. If you are someone who is going to wear cufflinks often then invest in something more quality.
",1
909,"At first glance this ring looks like no other. Ever since then, however, it has been nothing but a horrible mess. The tarnish free has tarnished! All of the stones lose their shine! Everything gets caught in the inside of the ring because it is practically hollow. If it even skims something it scratches. All in all nothing but a piece of junk!
",1
943,"It looks like a ring for a man when you look at the picture online, but in real life its a very feminine looking ring.
",1
1027,"Dispite paying EXTRA money for two day shipping, It is almost a week after my order and I STILL have not recieved this necklace. I also have not gotten any sort of response from the emails I have written the seller. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I'm starting to think that I paid for something that I am never actually going to have sent to me.
",1
1091,"I didn't even have it on for an hour and the chained popped. All I did was get into the car!
",1
1112,"I was going to purchase this until I watched the video which reveals a ""Made in China"" stamp on the inside of one of the wishbone arms. That is pretty tacky!
",1
1162,"One look was enough ... sent back immediately. Packaging was nice though but quality was definitely sub par especially how light weight they were ... settings were cheap too.
",1
1172,"A little dsappointed in the quality of this ring. Doesn't look half as nice in person as it does in the catalog.
",1
1191,"Wasn't what I expected. Was not satisfied with this. Too small. I need to look at other sizes.
",1
1198,"First, the color of the stones is lighter than is pictured. I realize it is hard to capture color in a picture, but the ring I received has stones that are light purple to almost a pink color. For the price of the ring I can deal with that though, I mean, what can you expect for $29? The worst part is that it's just hard to wear because it's not comfortable. It would have been better with five stones instead of seven because the two outer stones rub against your other fingers and it gets annoying fast. I'll be returning this ring and will try something else.
",1
1202,"When I received this ring, I put it aside because I was very ill at the timewhen I did look at it, it was past the time to return it. In the picture it looksround, but when i received it, it is more square than round. it justlooks odd and now I have a ring that is ugly and no one wants it.
",1
1267,"I have used one of these for a month, and I have observed myself, my general wellbeing, and my backpain with and without the necklace, while sleeping, while doing sport, while at the office... and I have not noticed any difference at all. For this, and because, in my research, I have not been able to find a even a single scientifically justified reason for these to work, I am giving it one star. I only hope that others read this review and think twice before spending their money.
",1
1268,"I have also seen many people wear these. I workout a lot. I decided to order two braclets and measured my wrist at 7 1/8 and order 7 1/2. I could not close the clasp. I sent them back only to have them returned!!! They told me it was custom- I order one black and one orange- how is that custom. I talked to two CS reps with the same answer- non-refundable!! They could have saved one customer by giving the correct size and sending back, instead they go to the expense of writing a letter and postage to send back the braclets.I have many people ask me about these in the gym- I can now tell them- DO NOT BUY, THE CS SUCKS. I guess I will find some kid in Middle School with skinny wrist and give it to them. I'm blown away.
",1
1291,"Come on, people! If these products really worked, everyone would wear them! The manufacturers want you to think they work, so they can sell them and make $$$. I have tried the phiten, and the balance bracelet, and magnetic therapy. I have noticed no change in my myriad aches, pains, and stiffnesses. I have worn a phiten necklace for over a month, just to give it a chance. If anything, I feel worse with it on, so I am giving up. Save your money!
",1
1294,"My necklace broke within a few weeks of purchase. (The bracelet I bought with it was too small. I wore it anyways, and it fell off within days and I lost it.)
",1
1315,"I don't know who the hell thinks this works, but it doesn't. Nice necklace though. I haven't stopped wearing it just because I don't have any other necklace to wear.
",1
1317,"Very, very, very dissatisfied with this order... NOT the correct size. NOT the item pictured. Not the item titled. Says 18"", but it came as 22"". I have a small neck... However, it shipped/arrived extremely quickly. ONLY good thing about ordering this item. I could have gotten pretty much the SAME EXACT item for $4.99 from another seller on Amazon. Stole $10 from me.
",1
1328,"Most of the stones turned black after a month or so...if you want it to simulate diamonds as I did--this is not it. I bought it as a make-shift wedding ring while pregnant and unable to wear mine, this only worked for a short time.
",1
1337,"I ordered an eternity band for my wedding ring because I thought it was a great deal. However I recieved a totally different ring. I had been given an engagement ring with the double banded wedding ring and the size was not accurate. I am very disappointed. Now, I have to go find a ring before my wedding and there's no time left!
",1
1345,"I was really disappointed with my pair of Eide Black Tahitian cultured pearl earrings. Instead of the beautiful pair of greenish black pear shaped unblemished pearls shown above, I got a pair of greenish/pinkish totally irregular black ""apple"" shaped blemished pearls.I felt misled by the description and image of the product.For comparison, I will be sharing an image of the pair I got.I do not recommend this product.
",1
1348,"I hate to say it but this was a disappointment. Everything seems nicer in photographs when it comes to jewelry on a budget.
",1
1352,"This is a bunch of plastic beads stuck to a metal bracelet. You can find much nicer stuff at a craft fair. :-P
",1
1372,"This is a cheaply made item that doesn't work well. The box doesn't close properly as the wood is unevenly cut and placed together. Also, the figures, etc... inside are pretty poorly done. For the cheap price, you can't go wrong but I'd rather spend more and get something better quality.
",1
1378,"This product was so cheap looking! It wasn't worth a dime. I am very disappointed!
",1
1393,"Admittedly, a $[...] jewelry box is not going to be heirloom quality and its appearance is certainly pretty enough for the 4-yr-old daughter I bought it for. To my adult eye, the box has the appearance of hardened cardboard and the ballerina is painted plastic of the cheesiest kind. The real flaw is that the mechanism that stops and starts the music is of the crudest kind: it basically folds - and sometimes crushes - the ballerina itself. Sure enough - after very little time - the plastic ballerina snapped.
",1
1396,"This product was subpar. I ordered it as a going-away gift for a colleague we dubbed - the Dancing Queen. When it came, it looked used, although it did not state such on the order. When wound, the ballerina twirled for about 30 seconds and then stopped, never to dance again- no matter what we tried. I would not recommend this product to anyone- especially if it is for a child.
",1
1397,"I bought this box as a gift for my daughter, but it was awful. Made in China, it just looks cheap and like it could fall apart at any minute. The music it plays is pretty and everything worked OK, but I guess this was not what I expected it to be. Very disappointing. I would highly recommend investing a bit more and buying something that will hold up to a young girl's curiosity.
",1
1422,"I'm 20 years old, and I bought this ring as a promise ring for my girlfriend. At first it was beautiful, and there were no problems, but she has had it for a little over a month and it has given her such a bad rash that she has started bleeding. This is not real sterling silver and looks poorly made. I would definitely never suggest anyone buy this ring.
",1
1440,"First of all, the one I received was defective. The animated scene sticks once every revolution and stops playing. It is possible to nudge it with a finger and get it going again. By nudging it along, I discovered the box's other flaw. &#34;Silent Night&#34; is horribly abbreviated and doesn't sound remotely right. If you were singing, it would be, &#34;Silent night, holy night. Sleep in heavenly peace.&#34;For $20, I didn't expect a symphony. But it isn't even worth $20.Naturally, Amazon has an excellent return policy, so I am satisfied in getting my money back.

1446,"I love ankle bracelets, and I've won one for years. this ankle bracelet has broken twice--each time I've worn it. I don't think I'm that tough on jewelry. I just think this ankle bracelet isn't substantial enough to survive being worn as an ankle bracelet.
",1
1478,"I have ordered many items with Amazon over the years and this is by far the WORST experience I have had. I was told that the item was being prepared for shipments and would ship June 30th thru July 2nd. It is now July 6th and I have not received an update. I also contacted Amazon customer service and have not received an update from them either. I do alot of online ordering and will try to order via Amazon whenever possible, I'm going to rethink that now as I recommend you do also.

Anyone even thinking of byeing this you've been warned!{so don't be anothere shame on you.} Just Don't do the same thing as I did resist yourself from buying it.

",1
1587,"I needed to return this item after I bought it. It is not a finely polished piece of jewelry (you can feel that it is rough when you run your hand over it). It kept snagging the hair of the person I had given it to. It could be a potential problem for anyone with long hair.

1601,"I put a diamond pendant on this chain which I wear all of the time. This necklace developed a kink within weeks, and broke in another month.

1759,"I bought a forzieri bracelet for my boyfriend this past christmas (2004) it is a version of the bracelet on this page.It was approximately $300 and one of the links broke almost IMMEDIATELY, we sent it to forzieri to get fixed (you have to ship it to Italy), and quite a few weeks later we got it back, problem fixed you would think no? NO! It broke again, same place, same problem a few months later. We sent it in early June once more to be fixed and have STILL NOT RECIEVED IT BACK. Upon them recieving it they sent me an e-mail promising it back in about a month!! I am writing this review on September 7th 2005 and the last contact I've had with them was 8/8 and I've sent a handful of e-mails since then with virtually no response, and when they do respond it's just to tell me it'll be a 'little while' longer.If you do decide to purchase from this company my advice is to be prepared to have it break, and pay for repairs locally if you want to keep it, because their repairs don't last and they take months.
",1
1784,"if you look at this ..it is 3D and appears to be faceted..be not decieved it is FLAT!This dissapointment would have been enough for me to score this low but the minus numbers arise because of the return policy....you have to jump through hoopes- slalum; climb everest; and oh.... in case you were thinking of sending the item back in a far superior package i.e. bubble envelope- because you threw out the rinky dinkey rubbish cardbord box that it came in... the joke is on you! So dumpster diving time!!!!What a shame! Never AGAIN!!!!

1787,"I ordered a Chefmaster 8 pc BBQ set in case from Amazon.com vendor (Dashlynn.com). I knew what I wanted to give my father for Christmas and after searching the internet I found many different vendors offering the BBQ set I wanted. Once I found it on Amazon.com, I decided to order it because I have had such great service from your company. Everything is as promised and on time and with this being a Christmas gift...I needed it on time. So, I place my order on Dec. 11th and the item was listed as &quot;in stock&quot; and my estimate delivery was Dec 18-24. I knew this would be close, but with the product in stock, would be no problem. After a week of not hearing anything about my order shipping, I tried to call Dashlynn three times only to be told they would research it and call me back later -- and never calling back! I also sent two email notes to customer service. Finally, after three days of trying I got an email reply for Dashlynn.com stating that the item was out of stock and therefore I would not be getting it! Now I am really in a bind. I have no time to order the item from another vender this close to Christmas. This has been a HUGE dissapointment! I would have appreciated Dashlynn to notify me immediately after I placed my order of the order status and not a week and a half later, at my request! Also, I wish Amazon.com would not have this type of company listed under your umbrella. I trusted them because I trust you and they obviously do not live up to your customer service standards. I would like this passed on to them as well. I am not stuck with a few days to try and find something else for a gift. GET RID OF DASHLYNN!!!

1829,"I was very disappointed when I received these earrings. I purchased them as a gift, but I'm not sure if I'll still give them away. They're called &quot;Pink Shell&quot; earrings, but the shell looks pretty white to me...more like mother-of-pearl without a hint of pink. If you're looking for pink, these won't be the earrings for you.

1898,"Look! I know this ring is NOT available at this time, but as long as you have it listed you should tell the truth about it. I bought this ring from Amazon in 2007, and there is NO WHITE GOLD anywhere on it. That's just a photo-illusion. Plus, there are ONLY 30 DIAMONDS on it, not 34 as listed. You can count them yourself from the picture. Either CORRECT the description, or remove this item entirely from the listings. Thanks!

1931,"I purchased this bracelet for a gift. It appeared to be a beautiful bracelet but it fell apart! The pieces of jade separated from the gold/silver part of the bracelet. When the gift was opened, the bracelet fell apart. The recipient glued it with a jeweler's glue but 10 days later another piece came apart. Horrible, horrible quality. I was very embarrassed. Purchasers BEWARE!

2073,"This ended up larger than I was hoping for and still haven't even bothered to wear them. Plus the look of them are not too appealing, imagine if they were stamped straight from a flat sheet of metal. The picture makes it look like they have some roundness or curve to them, but mine certainly did not.

2097,"If you read the add you (at least I was) are led to believe that you were getting more than one bracelet. They charged me $9 for shipping a small two ounce yellow padded envelope with only one inside which was double the price of the bracelet(s)! I tried contacting the company several times and could only leave messages of which no one returned my calls. I went back later and resurched the add and they had changed the price. Oblivious to me they had made a mistake advertising their product and were not going to honor their add. Shame on them!

2117,"This 14K Yellow Gold 7 Inch x 3.0 mm Figaro chain bracelet felt like tin and had an unattractive bright yellow shine. It had the type of shine were I felt if the bracelet were larger I could clearly see my face in it. The edges of the bracelet were rough on the skin. So it went back in the box and was returned. I was a very disappointed customer.

The chain is ridiculously flimsy and light weight. One yank and it will break. I had planned to purchase two additional chains but have changed my mind for the price to value is just not there.
",1
2243,"Look! I know this ring is NOT available at this time, but as long as you have it listed you should tell the truth about it. I bought this ring from Amazon in 2007, and there is NO WHITE GOLD anywhere on it. That's just a photo-illusion. Plus, there are ONLY 30 DIAMONDS on it, not 34 as listed. You can count them yourself from the picture. Either CORRECT the description, or remove this item entirely from the listings. Thanks!
",1
2255,"Although these are sterling silver, they are very light weight, so they do not hang well, making them look cheap. The strands are linked by very small chains so they don't move/dangle and even get stuck sideways instead of straight down, again making them look cheap. Needless to say, I returned them. I guess you have to buy the real thing... sigh.
",1
2257,"i just received these today and they don't look anything like crabs. if you could distinguish any animal characteristics it would be a spider, but mostly they look like little blobs of shiny metal. don't be deceived by the detailed look of the picture.

2270,"I wish I had given more credibility to the negative reviews. Frankly, I don't understand how there ecould be so many positive reviews. It's an ok chain - if you want to wear it by itself. But it's not good for pendants, as advertised. It remains perfectly stiff and oval shaped when worn - even a large pendant doesn't pull the chain down as a pendant normally does. I'm returning it.
",1
2331,"I recieved this as a gift for my birthday, and when I opened it, I was terribly dissapointed. The earrings have two different prongs. One earring has all three prongs pictured (one of which looks like 'v', as shown), and the other has a different prong at the point of the earring. They are unwearable! The vendor has very poor quality control: they either should have noticed this before they shipped it, or their craftmanship is poor.

These earrings are not suitable for an adult and indeed would probably be too small and too difficult to open for a child. I am returning this pair. They were inexpensive but I would not keep them even if they were free
",1
2383,"Frankly, I'm angry. I never received the item ever. The company won't return my emails or calls. The only time they responded they told me it was already delivered, which it clearly was not.DO. NOT. BUY from this vendor.

2403,"Yes, they are small, but what I got and what's in the picture are not even close! My earrings are all orange stones with none of the lovely shading that enticed me to order them. Talk about being disappointed, that's an understatement. Too bad, so sad, I've been had.
",1
2440,"I will be returning this item. In the picture it appears that this necklace has very nice marcasite stones, but they are so tiny you can barely see them. Also, despite what the picture seems to show, there are only five stones. And the chain is just like those on gumball machine necklaces.
",1
2500,"I returned this after I received it. To me it looked very cheap and not worth the cost. Looked like a child's charm, but it was hand crafted. The return was very easy and they handled it very well. It was a good company to deal with, unfortunately I was not satisfied with the item.
",1
2543,"Beware - this product looks nothing like the picture. There is no detail - just a tiny flat piece of gold and definitely not worth the price, and the bale is not even soldered. I sent it back.

2601,"As the previous reviewer stated, the band on this ring is just intolerably thin. The first ring I received was so beautiful that I hoped the crumpled band was an aberration, so I contacted the company and sent it back for a replacement. They were very courteous and prompt in all communications. Unfortunately, the second ring also had a hair-thin band, but at least it wasn't already crumpled in the box! I'm afraid to wear it; it's so thin. But it's so beautiful and relatively inexpensive that I decided to keep it, and maybe look into getting the band reinforced -- although that will likely cost more than the ring did.

2648,"I guess I shouldn't have been disappointed but I am. I purchased it because I am a very small person and I thought that this would be the perfect size. However, it's much smaller than it appears. I wear about a size 3 and the 3-prong diamond barely covers 1/4 of my finger. The gold does not appear to be 14k either as this is really light-weight and a very light yellow shade. I almost thought that I bought a white gold band. This ring has a very flimsy feel to it and it's cheaper than I would have imagined. Not to mention that the ring was an imperfect circle. I wouldn't be surprised if it bent if I squeezed it. I am even more disappointed because Amazon did not send a certificate with it like they did when I purchased my previous ring. I do not recommend this ring to anyone. It looks dinky and you're better off purchasing a 1/4 ct solitaire. This ring just doesn't look right.

2674,"I RETURNED THE EARRINGS PER INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY PEARL CLOSEOUTS, AND HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD FROM THEM. I HAVE SENT 4 EMAILS, NOTHING I WANT MY MONEY REFUNDED NOW, ASAP I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN NOR DO I SUGGEST ANYONE MAKE A PURCHASE.

In my opinion, they aregaudy and look phony, and they are not at all what I wanted. I feel terrible aboutthis, too, as I had requested them as a gift, expecting stones more than half thesize and more useful for everyday wear.If you are shopping for jewlery on Amazon, please pay attention to size! If you areunsure, PLEASE double check! I wish I had saved myself the trouble! Hopefully, Amazonwill begin including scale-reference photographs for products such as these.

2724,"I was lying down to go to sleep when I felt something weird in my mouth. Well it turned out that the top ball from the tongue ring had some how undone itself, and fell in my throat. This is not the first time that one of the acrylic tongue rings that I have orderd from this web site have done this. Most of them the ball from the top cracks and it just comes off. It's quite irritating.

The main diamond is on the large size however, the diamonds all around the wedding band and engagement ring are so tiny you need a magnifying glass to see them. Additionally, the wedding band width is SO THIN, it is obvious that it is not real. The silver is also too shiny making it look cheap. I did not return the item, good enough for wearing around the kids. I would NOT go out of the house with this one... not worth it in my opinion. I was very disappointed.

It came in the mail and I did not take it out of the plastic wrapping it was in when it arrived. I put it right in to the gift bag. My daughter opened it thie morning and the chain is broken, not even at the clasp. It is broke right in one of the chain links!!! Thanks for NOTHING.

I received only one necklace in a nice box and it did NOT even have batteries IN the necklace, I attempted to install the spares that were provided and those were dead. The other necklace which should have been in a nice box, because thats what I paid for, was carelessly thrown in a plastic bag. And to top it all off it took a week to get here and Im a Prime Member. This company business model is poor, now Im faced with going to the battery store to get batteries for the first one cause there is no time to return these as I see my friend this weekend. Also both necklaces were completely different. This company should not be on Amazon. Period. Dont buy from them.

The balls are a dirty white pearl color not the glittery white as pictured. It it also super long.

The shipping fee assessed at the point of purchase was equal to a fourth of the price of the product at my price point and there is no free shipping on returns. The customer service rep was defensive when I shared my disappointment. A refund was promptly received. I am not interested in reordering.

3220,"I own couple of love knot studs and seen many, but I've never seen such a poor quality ones! those are huge! very very heavy and cheaply made! the grooves are painted carelessly with black paint to enhance the looks and give a false feeling of void, but it's actually a colored block of solid steel. I highly recommend going for the classic ones (plain) they look much classier, smaller and lighter.

I'd upgrade at least one more star, maybe two if I could.----------------------------------------------------------My son wanted to buy mama's present this Christmas so naturally, we turned to Amazon for computer skill training and the ability to view a lot of products easily.The earrings arrived today (very quickly) but the stone is not nearly as robust as the picture depicts. The stone is white, like a fake diamond. When viewed in other kinds of light, you can see a slight tint of blue but nothing like the picture.Another issue - the clasp or ear stud is flimsy. I may return them (need to ask my son) but I don't think these earrings will last more than a couple of wears.On the positive side - it really is a nice design.

I had to buy an emergency back-up Christmas gift for my best friend!

My seven-year-old daughter hardly ever wound up the music box, and then one day it just stopped working. My husband thinks that it may be the spring. Whatever the case may be, we are extremely disappointed, as this was supposed to be one of the special gifts our daughter received for Christmas.

3454,"I bought this jewelry box for my daughter's birthday. I was so happy when I first opened the shipping box and saw that it was indeed just as beautiful as it looked in the picture. However, when I turned it over I saw a small warning sticker on the bottom of the box. It warned me that the jewelry box contained lead and should not be eaten or chewed. Fine, my daughter is past the age where she would chew on it. However, the warning continued, saying that it may generate dust containing lead. Unacceptable. I am promptly returning this jewelry box as I do not want my daughter exposed to any levels of lead knowing that lead can cause so many problems especially with learning development. No jewelry box is worth that no matter how pretty the picture.

3508,"AS soon as I rec'd the earrings, I noticed in the little transparent plastic bag that the one shell was not attached to anything. But as soon as I notifed the company, they immediately said they would refund my money, which they did. Even tho the product was packaged very well to ship, I imagine that that is where the shell became unattached. As they say, ""accidents happen"" and because the company was so accomodating, I would definately use them again. So ""1 star"" for the earrings, but ""10 stars"" to the company.

I too ordered one, not the greatest, but I expected that because of what I paid for it, I am not going to be shocked or surprised when the emblem breaks, or you can't read what it says on the back. I did not buy it to impress anyone. I just want the authorities to know that I am a diabetic, if I can't tell them myself. My main gripe with this company, is that the item was backordered, and no one told me, so after about three weeks or so after the due date I became concerned (NOT TOO CONCERNED ONLY 5 BUCKS), but none the less they told me ""OH YEAH THAT HAS BEEN OUT OF STOCK ON BACK ORDER WE SHOULD BE GETTING THEM IN SHORTLY"" It would have been nice to know this before I became worried.....Bottom line you get what you pay for..............

3842,"I wanted gold studs with a screw back so that I could wear them all the time without worry. They do have screw backs, but the screw apparatus does not have a back opening for the post to pass through, so the earrings cannot be made to snugly fit. Instead, they are balls on posts that stick out in front. I wanted the screw back, so I paid three times as much as similar earrings with a push back, but these do not look right. By the way, the backs in the photo are not what I received.I would love to contact the seller for different backs, however I don't see how I can do this, as this is not one of the ""available actions"".

3923,"I have to completely and utterly disagree with the one other review of this bracelet. I bought it for my sister as a sort of last minute birthday present since it was pretty affordable. Even though this is a cheap piece of jewelry, it looks MUCH cheaper than its ~$20.00 price tag. You could probably get this for a quarter out of a bubblegum machine. It looks plastic, feels plastic, probably is plastic, even though ""ITALY"" is engraved on the clasp. Please, please, don't buy this bracelet if you don't want to waste your money. But if you're looking for a plastic-looking piece of jewelry, this is perfect for you.

3935,"I suppose I didn't read the description correctly, but I did think these were bigger than they were. I bought them as a gift for my grown daughter since her birthday is in Jan. and they're a garnet stone, but they'd probably be better as a gift for a small child. After reading the other reviews I just hope the stones - infitisimal as they are, don't fall out.

It was too late to return them, so we just threw them out. Due to the design, the earring bends a little each time you put them on or off. It's really a shame, because they are quite nice, but, it's only a matter of time before the stone(s) will pop out.

3962,"I got these as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. I thought they'd make a good stocking stuffer since peridot is her birthstone. However, when I recieved the pair I ordered, I immediately opened them up to make sure they were what I had ordered. One of the earrings had a missing peridot stone. I returned them as per Amazon.com's return policy (which I must say, is extremely easy to use, painless, and hassle-free). I recieved a replacement pair within a short period of time (still before Christmas) and checked them to see if they had all of the stones intact. Unfortunatly, the replacement pair also had a earring that was missing a peridot stone (in a different position than the last pair). After I sent the second pair back, Amazon.com refunded my money and apologized for the problem. Good service from the company, too bad the product had flaws.

After recieving instuctions on how to return ring I did exactly as told. When after 2 weeks and no ring or explanation from company I contacted them and was told they had not recieved the ring but, would refund my money. The total credit I recieved was for the amount of ring and original S&H; but not the shipping I paid to send it back or the money I had to send to get the ring shipped back to me again.The emails exchange with Silver Insanity was very unprofessional, making me wonder if this company was ready to go internet with such a large market through Amazon.Will NOT order from them again.

The emeralds are very, very, poor quality, don't even look like emeralds, they are milky white, nothing like the ones represented on their web site. I contacted Fred Meyer Jewerly, explained the problem, I can return them, but I have to pay the return shipping and insurance. I feel that since the stones were so badly miss represented, that they should pay the return, but they refuse. I will never order from thenm again.

4243,"1st and formost I did not want to give this thing one star but page will not save unless you choose atlease 1. This bracelet was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my mother in law. I paid $160 for it and was extremely disappointed when I received it. It was about to fall apart. and very cheep and fake looking. I have contacted the Company Palm Beach Jewelers and they have guaranteed me a full refund upon shipment of the product back to them. I will be shipping out this weekend and hopefully they refund me as promised.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED :(

4304,"MADE IN ITALY.Amazon mangled (badly bent and dented) this necklace when they packed it into the presentation box. There were clips that were supposed to hold the necklace in place and they had been torqued down way too tightly on the necklace causing major crimps in the ""ribbon of gold""!! Whoever packed it, destroyed it!!Box was cheap and bottom bowed outwards so that it did not sit flat on a table. Blue velvet looked very worn in spots. One cardboard piece inside the box had fallen off the rusty metal interior. Looked like it had been glued years ago with a hot glue gun that didn't hold. I had to throw out the box and come up with something presentable myself.Necklace is wide, but very, very thin and it gets dented very easily! (see above) Yes, it has a nice, shiny yellow color, but it is very fragile! Maybe that's to be expected when buying jewelry online for a low cost?

4345,"I had this beautiful bracelet for 3 weeks before the clasp started to become loose. Even with the secondary clasp, it fell of at my company x-mas party (4 weeks after purchase) and was never to be found. Someone got a very nice x-mas gift from me. I suggest that the making of the clasp be improved, and would not recommend the purchase of this item until then.Jim

4371,"It's very pretty, but the stone fell out fairly quickly and after about a month (occasional wear), the metal between the loop and the top of the pendant bent and then broke.

4399,"I purchased this with the understanding that it was in fact an opal. Not so. The stone is clearly costume jewelry. It is an ugly white translucent stone with barely a hint of color. Also, the stones are on hooks, NOT attached solidly with a full loop so the 'gems' keep falling off the base with any movement. BUYER BEWARE!!!

4445,"If this were $10, it would be a good purchase as a cheap, sentimental gift for someone. Because it's just that; cheap. It is much smaller than expected, and it looks it comes from a dollar store.

4450,"I ordered this based on the rave reviews. I am very sorry that I did, because it looks like is should cost $5 at the most. I returned it, but only received half my money back! Don't be taken in by these reviews--this is a piece of junk!

4474,"I purchased this ring thinking it had been enlarged for the picture. It is huge. I wish it were smaller, although some people like goddy and pretentious. I took it out of the box it came in- a cheap scratched up foil looking thing, and as I inspected the ring, I immediately noticed two of the side stones were missing. Since the ring is huge you cant miss it. I also looked at the ring from the top and noticed that the sides stones on either side of the smokey quartz were not even. By not even I mean that it was flat on one side but had ridges on the other. The reason being is that the setting on one side does NOT match the other. One side has two arrow like structures pointing up towards the quartz and the other side has two flat bars going across. There is no excuse for sending a product this shabby to anyone. Clearly they were not paying attention to their own product. I would not buy from this company again. There policy is that I am supposed to pay return shipping to them, and enclose more money for them to send back?? How that fair? They should produce a product that is not sub-standard instead of putting it all on the buyer when the photos of the product did not show all sides of the ring to begin with.

4529,"The product arrived damaged. I tried to call the store several times, but nobody ever answered the phone. I left a voicemail for customer service, but never received a followup call.

4603,"Typically everything I purchase from Amazon I have been extremely happy with and I rely much on other customer reviews. I have been eyeballing this bracelet for some time now. After debating I decided to go ahead and order it. First off it smells AWFUL! I can't even describe the smell but it smells toxic and like something you shouldn't be putting anywhere near/on your skin. The wooden clasp was all sorts of chipped, uneven and had sharp splinters sticking out all over. Does anyone do a check before sending out defective merchandise???? AND the way the strings of beads are held together from the looks of it I could have made this bracelet myself. The strings were tied and cut way too short and are on the verge of unraveling probably on the first wear. Definitely disappointed because it looked like it would be a piece that would spruce up a would be plain outfit. Do yourself a favor and save your $10. Maybe I got a lemon? But I highly doubt it.Hope this helps someone debating on whether or not to purchase.

4698,"I bought this pendant around Xmas and I was quite disappointed when I received it. It was poorly constructed.The Black Onyx is stuck on with glue to a base made of silver. The first fault I noticed was a crooked cross. This was because the Black Onyx wasn't aligned properly when it was stuck to its silver base. Traces of glue were left stuck on the sides of the Black Onyx which I had to clean off. The silver at the back also had some stain spots. It looks much better on the net than it does in real life. It was it bit embracing to give this cross as a gift hoping the person didn't recognise the faults which were quite obvious to me.
",1
4699,"I loved this cross its beautiful. But after 2 days of wear one of the onyx bars fell out. All I did was wear it and it fell out. Which tells me it was made very badly. For beauty I'd rate this cross a 5 out of 5. But overall because of poor craftsmenship I have to rate this a 1. I wish this was a better made product because I really do love it. I hope this helps someone to not waste their money unless they plan on only displaying it and not wearing it.

4725,"I was excited to give this as a gift to my girlfriend for Christmas. When I looked at the necklace that I had received, I could not believe they would ship something so black and tarnished. I don't know how there are so many positive reviews on here, the piece I received was complete junk.Update: The seller contacted me, and offered to let me purchase another necklace with waived shipping, to replace the one I returned. They offered an explanation about silver tarnishing easily, and perhaps the plastic bag it was in wasn't completely sealed. In light of this, and the fact that tarnishing is a natural process, I have taken the picture down, but I still want the review to stay up as a warning of what you might get.

4876,"Length:: 0:20 MinsWARNING: This is a video of an allergic reaction I had to the 16"" snake chain necklace sold by GEM AVENUE and it maybe disturbing to squeamish people.The resolution is low which is probably a good thing because a more detailed visual of this rash would be disgusting.I wore the necklace to the gym, to shower, and to sleep for 2 days/nights in a row, so I obviously sweated on it. I woke up on the third day with this rash, it's less red in the video than in person. What's most disturbing about the rash is the patch of black skin towards the back of my neck. I've knowingly worn non-precious metal necklaces before and developed a similar rash with black patches of skin where the necklace touches skin.I don't understand how I could have gotten this rash unless the necklace is only partially made of sterling silver with some other non-precious metal if any silver at all. I've never had an allergic reaction like this to precious metals, i.e. gold, platinum, silver, and surgical steel, even while wearing them an entire month in a row (to the gym, beach, shower, sleep, etc.).If you are like me and are allergic to non precious metals, you might have the same reaction...but I hope you don't!

4879,"This is a follow up to the very positive review I gave this necklace about 1 1/2 weeks ago. Well, this morning after a very easy turn of the chain to move the clasp to the back of my neck, the chain just snapped apart, not at the clasp but just in the middle of the chain, like someone had just cut it with scissors. It is a shame because it looks really nice but now I am out the money and no chain. Very disappointed. Had not had it even 2 weeks.

I e-mailed Palm Beach and when I had not received a responce by the next afternoon I called them ( I needed the extender for an event in 4 days). The customer service representative told me they were out of the gold extenders, said they were on backorder. I have a 3 inch silver extender with the ball on the end from Palm Beach and like it, if I had received another silver extender like that I would have not complained, I received a piece of junk from Palm Beach.Update...I emailed Palm Beach about the wrong item and they said they were sending me a gold necklace extender. Today I received yet ANOTHER silver necklace extender with the item number 44139 on the box and with the packing slip saying it was item 44139 the gold necklace extender. The wrong item I received today is the silver necklace extender with the ball on the end (the same style as the the gold I ordered)....I like this silver extender and have ordered a gold extender from another company on Amazon.

I was warned by several other reviewers that the shade is less than would be expected, AND they were right on the money. The stones in this ring are barely blue, and really not very pretty. It looks cheap and I would agree with one other reviewer who stated that it would have been better to have 5 slightly larger stones instead of the 7 smaller ones. It spans too far across the finger and the sizing does seem to be slightly smaller than the size stated. Save your money for something better.

Palmbeach Jewelry wanted more information, blood and a right arm!My sister told Palmbeach Jewelry that she wasn't going to submit anything further, this was now an internal issue and that she will just contact her credit card company to dispute the charge and file a complaint with the BBB.The Palmbeach Jewelry rep had the sheer gall to tell my sister that if she filed a complaint and disputed the charges she would never be able to shop with Palmbeach Jewelry again (((LOL)))Two weeks later a refund was issued.BEWARE!!! Read their reviews and check what others are saying about return issues.My sister made this purchase at PalmbeachJewelry.com not Amazon.One thing I can say about Amazon is they don't mess around when it comes to customer satisfaction.

5435,"I ordered this pendant about two weeks ago choosing free shipping. It arrived on Fri. Sept. 17th. The item was well packaged and the box was undamaged. As I opened the box I began to notice problems. The snake chain and pendant were in separate zip lock bags. When I opened the bag with the chain, a short length of very small jump rings fell on the floor. This was obviously an ""adjuster chain"" to vary the length of the snake chain. I carefully examined it and found no separations or broken links. So whoever packaged it just threw them in together. I then noticed that the snake chain had been crushed several inches from one end, causing an irreparable kink.I then examined the pendant itself. The setting was cast silver and the stone was not bezel set but rather cut to the size of the casting and glued in place (like an inlay). The stone had been poorly cut. leaving a gap at the top, and it had the lower left corner cut off, thus leaving another gap. The bale was crooked, listing about 10 degrees to the right. And finally, while the piece had been advertised as red tiger eye, it was not. It was common golden tiger eye with two tiny red stripes near the center. I'm not naive, I know that this is a factory piece and is at a low price point. I liked the overall design of the pendant and would have kept it as a gold tiger eye if there hadn't been so many quality problems. As a result, I returned it.

5461,"In good lighting from even a couple feet away there are very obvious visible flaws. The shade of the pearls is pretty. Paid $17 for them, and reviewing them as if they cost $17. They are going in the garbage. I would love to return them... I have managed to lose both the flimsy fasteners in not even ten minutes time. The rod that goes through the ear... whatever that is called is notched, so a decent amount of force sometimes has to be applied to remove the fasteners at which point they go flying. The box they came with is quite nice for $17.I really don't know pearls all that well, but I do understand jewellery. I don't know what they are smoking if they think these are worth $75. I am not at all pleased at $17, and wish I could return them, though I've lost the fasteners. Amazon has quite a nice selection of jewellery, but maybe pearls are one of those things that just must be bought in person.

Stylistically, I give this jewelry rack 5 stars -- aesthetically pleasing, and does the job!However, BEWARE: it will cause your jewelry to tarnish!!! I put all my earrings on here -- a mixture of white gold, sterling silver, and crappy ones bought from Icing and Claire's. Tarnishing is caused by oxidation, and the better the metal (ie platinum, gold, silver) the less it should tarnish (relative to nickel and other cheap metals). I've only had this rack for one month, and for some reason, ALL my sterling silver started tarnishing -- that includes 2 different necklaces and 2 different pairs of earrings. My white gold jewelry is fine, and for the strangest reason my crappy jewelry from Claire's is fine (I'm assuming there's some protective coating on it??) but all my sterling silver is turning color!!!! :(Such sadness! I really liked this rack and would have given it 5 stars. However, it caused four pieces of my nice jewelry to tarnish and so I just put them back in their box.. which defeats the purpose of having a jewelry rack. And those four pieces of jewelry are ruined too :(

5870,"Ordered two of these to give to young girls in our family for Christmas this year. They arrived during an 8-day power outtage so I didn't open them right away, assuming that they were fine since so many people reviewed them favorably. I finally opened them to check them out today, and was very disappointed. One of them had a warped base and didn't sit flat on a flat surface (it rocked). The other was even more bent, it looked like the leaning tower of Pisa. Sending them back for a refund.I should note that the two I received are a slightly different design than what's pictured. The ""curled under"" parts at the top of the harp, instead of tapering into a point like the one pictured, have just a blunt cut-off end. This does make the harp slightly less attractive... but more importantly, tells me that they have changed the way they make the product since some of those favorable reviews were posted. As a result, overall quality of the product seems to have suffered.If I had the guts, I would attempt to straighten the warped and bent metal myself, but I am afraid that I might destroy the entire product and then be stuck with it. The soldered joints don't look stable enough to tolerate manipulation. Perhaps if I'd spent five or seven bucks apiece on them, I would give it a go. But the product was fairly expensive (for what you get), and I'm not willing to eat the cost.Sorry, I REALLY wanted to like this product (and have some of my Christmas shopping done).

These pearls are definitely not suitable to give as gifts, unless your recipient is EASILY impressed. Most of the pearls on the string were badly misshapen. They looked like two half-pearls squashed together. They just weren't nice at all.The good things were the color and the packaging. The packaging was stellar. The pearls were not, alas. I'm stuck with these because there's no way I can give them as a gift, and I misplaced the receipt so I can't return them.If you want a better option, look forPearl Freshwater Cultured Pink Tones Necklace Strand 7.5-8mm 18"" Heart Clasp Bucasi-- which were cheaper than the PearlsOnly pearls and considerably more beautiful. There were no double pearls in my strand, the pearls were very symmetrical (for freshwater pearls, anyway!), and the colors were lovely. The clasp was stunning, too.

6035,"[...]I ordered these earrings as a Christmas present for my wife. About two months after the order, the stone for one of the earrings broke into two pieces. There is a hole drilled into each amethyst stone through which a support is threaded to hold the earrings. It is along this hole that the stone cracked. It was the second time my wife had worn them.[...]

6061,"I was quite excited when I received my box in the mail yesterday. However when I opened the package my excitement quickly faded. The quality of the box is very poor. The floral design was just a stencil carved in with what looks like leather working tools. The curves around the flower petals and vines are horribly done and left sharp points instead of rounded. The wood looks nice on the outside however this is only due to the stain color that was applied. The floral pattern does a bad job of covering up the notches and holes in the wood on the outside. On the inside of the box there are flimsy wood pieces of another type on the bottom to cover the nasty holes of the wood. They are attached to each side of the box with two small dabs of wood glue that quickly came undone after a few times being opened and closed. Now every time I open the box I have to slide these ""disguising"" wood pieces back into their place. The size of the box is a little smaller than I had anticipated. The only thing that really pleased me about the box is that hinges were attached to the lid and bottom, although the nails stick out from being hammered in crooked. If you are looking for a nice box for jewelry, small keepsakes, or what have you I suggest looking elsewhere. Spend your money on a better quality product.

It was also much smaller than advertised. When I went to return it they charged me a $18 restocking fee which is contrary to their money back guarantee. Don't believe or trust them. My CC company returned the difference because they found szul in the wrong. Don't be fooled. Be warned instead.

I, ehm, told my wife I was trying to convert her from Christianity to the ancient Egyptian mythos and get her to start worshipping the sun, and that went over like a ton of bricks as well.

6599,"I noticed that the design of this bracelet includes a ribbon motif, like the kinds of coloured ribbons that people wear on certain days in remembrance of people who are victims of tragedies, such a breast cancer, AIDS, suicide or road accident fatalities. To regard autistic people in the same way, as being the victims of a tragic misfortune, can be seen as a dreadful personal insult to us, because autism/Aspergers is a fundamental part of who were are, we don't have autism, we are autistic. Save your pity for someone who needs it, mate!And the bracelet also uses the autism puzzle motif that many autistic people find objectionable. One of the better known autism activist web sites has a logo on it that says ""I am not a puzzle I am a person"". It should be obvious to any thinking person that the idea of autism being a puzzle is a neurotypical-centric point of view of autism and autistic people. When a neurotypical person expresses the opinion that autistics are a puzzle, they are only flaunting their own lack of knowledge, not empathy or understanding.

However, I have since discovered that is is poorly made. The small wire circles that connect the bracelet together are weak. Within few days, one link fell apart and the bracelet fell off. Happily with a pair of pliers, I could squeeze the link back together, but I now realize that this is likely to keep happening, so am reluctant to wear it without watching for this. I expect I will loose it another time.

I've seen a lot of Celtic-style jewelry in a wide range of prices, and this is definitely ""low-end"" in every respect.

The next day I was in a meeting just sitting there and all of a sudden the bracelet broke and the beads went everywhere. I was very upset. Though it was not a lot of money the shipping price is unbelievable. I did not find that out until after I bought it. It is very pretty but I would not reccomend this product.

8371,"My husband bought me a lovely ring from gemaffair for Christmas. It was the ring I always dreamed of. I got dressed for Christmas. When I arrived at my mother's house, one of the stones had fallen out. I did nothing unusual except get dressed.I returned the ring to gemaffair (at my own expense). They say that since I ""damaged the ring"" they would not accept the return, wanted over $50 for a repair (the ring cost $140) or they would return it to me, but I had to pay the 6.95 shipping. Do they think I intentionally broke the ring? I didn't feel any catching or pulling of any sort. Frankly if I had, I would have just taken it to my own jeweler for repair since I would have recognized that I broke the ring. I have dozens of rings, in many settings and styles. I have never broken a prong, nor have I ever been so dissatisfied with a vendor. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT shop here. Their service stinks....and the merchandise quality is lousy.

The open-work cat pendant is really cute and nicely done, but the chain that it floats on is about as thin as a hair. It would break if someone sneezed on it. When I see something described as a ""rope chain"" I think of something a little more substantial.The necklace arrived in a box wrapped around a slotted, folded envelope stuffed with tissue paper and cushioned with a tiny scrap of bubblewrap. In other words, if you buy this necklace, you will also need to purchase another gift box to present it in because the one that came with the necklace looks like trash.I am really angry to have paid $45 for what was probably worth only $15.

8539,"Beautiful out of the package, I wore it for about two weeks before it tarnished badly enough to need cleaned. Owning sterling jewelry, I thought it was a little odd, as jewelry doesn't need polished that often when you wear it. So I used my silver jewelry cleaning cloth and was amazed to find the metal is NOT sterling, it's actually penny colored. Okay, to be honest there are a few specks of sterling... the east, west & south dots and the band surrounding & holding the stone are. I contacted the seller twice and have gotten NO response. It looks horrible, I am BUMMED.

Those stones were beyond cheap looking and had no glitz or sparkle! I immediately packaged them up and took to the nearest postal service for return.They sure had potential and I had every intention of buying as gifts for others if the set I received were as nice as I had thought theywould be. I did take the time to review the comments at Amazonwhich is a wonderful option, but in this case, somehow I didnot agree with the majority of the reviews. I guess it is true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Perhaps it was justbecause it had the Paris Hilton name that was the draw. Too bad they didn't work out as they could have been worn dressed up or down ! !

8761,"I saw a chain just like this in Claire's the other day. It cost $15, and I'd bet any amount of money that it would last longer than Hilton's line - and this is from a store known for its cheaply-made costume jewelry.Guess what, girls? A 3-and-a-half-foot long sterling silver chain with glued-on ""crystals"" (read: cubic zirconia at best, plastic at worst) doesn't cost $95 to produce. It costs maybe - maybe! - $10, and that's assuming the factory's in the US. Don't throw any more of your money away. Why mothers would even allow, let alone encourage, their teenage daughters to idolize a trashy, spoiled, vapid waste of space like Paris Hilton is beyond me.
",1
8762,"Honestly, who wants to hang a chain around their waist? No, seriously? Can you imagine how that would even FEEL?! Ugh, to me, this is the biggest waste of money if i've ever seen one. 100 dollars of CRAP!! You can buy those fake rhinestones in the craft store, stick them around your waist, and they'd look just the same, not only cost about, hm, FIVE DOLLARS, at the most!!! Don't buy this, it's honestly a COMPLETE waist of money.

I thought they were of poor quality, and the stars bent out of shape when I opened and closed them. In addition, the latch on one side was very loose, and the other side was very stiff (hence the bending of the shape). Needless to say, I returned them.

Dont get me wrong, the earrings are beautiful, but after waiting a month after ordering these earrings (after my order kept getting pushed back and pushed back), I got a defective earring that would'nt even close.

The crystals are so small they don't even sparkle. I was really disappointed with the packaging, just a plain navy blue box, with a tag inside. I guess for $30.00 i expected more.
",1
8795,"I got this as a gift (along with the bad perfume, but that's another category) and there were stones missing! I feel so bad for my Aunt who bought this. I could hardly ask for the receipt to return it, so I threw it in the trash. You could make this yourself for under 1 dollar. A heart shaped pendant at the bead store, a few small plastic rhinestones, 12 inches of cord and some glue.

8798,"My daughter really wanted this necklace so against my better judgment I purchased it for her.What a disappointment. The first week the satin cord came out of the clasp and we had to glue it back in. Next the crystal (small as they are) started popping out. After 1 month there is nothing left - and we threw it away last night. $30 is not a lot of money unless of course you are buying junk.
",1
8805,"You just wasted $30 of your money, instead of actually buying something worth it like two new CDs, or something. Ok, the necklace is cheap, it's a fabric cord, around your neck, not even a sterling silver one, at least metal, it should be. The jewels are probably, those cheap fabric rhinestones or something like that.. Come'on their charging this much, cause it's a 'Paris Hilton' original. What a bunch of B.S. I mean, it's not an ugly neckalce, but it's not worth even $20!! I've seen better jewlery at k-mart & it'd probably last longer too. So, I'd save you're money, believe me, there's better things to use your money on, than this. I don't own this or will ever buy it either!!

8808,"My boyfriend purchased the Heart Pendant on the sation pink cord last year sometime. I wore it maybe 2 times and it broke. the cord came completely out of the clasp. He fixed it for me, then the clasp broke. I would not recommend buying this necklace. From what i see, others have had the same problems as I have. ~Amanda

8811,"I was very disappointed when I bought this piece for my daughters B-Day. It looks like a cheap piece of junk and is very overpriced. there is nicer jewelry on sale in the stores for the same price. The satin cord pulls loose from the clasp within 2 weeks and cannot be reattached. Your only choice is to return it as defective or buy a thin chain to replace the cord (defeating the ""pink"" look). There are similar reviews here for the satin cord issue, as well as stones falling out. I am surprised & dismayed that Paris would allow her name to be placed on this garbage. THINK TWICE.
",1
8818,"As mentioned before, this necklace is almost exactly like the Elsa Peretti Carved Heart pendant by Tiffany's. Both have a silky cord and carved out heart in sterling silver. Although this one is pink and jeweled, the main difference between the necklaces is in the quailty.

Sadly, though when reading other's review, some complain of the crystals falling out, the satin cord falling apart, and the piece being extremely smaller than expected. I mean, I want a nice piece of jewerly, I want it a bit big for others to notice it. I want the cord to hold up for a long time, and I really want the stones to stay in place!!! I mean, for $35 of my OWN money, its GOT to be nice!

8877,"This ring is made of the cheapest ""silver"" known to man... it leaves your finger black within minutes of putting it on. These days, silver is usually at LEAST coated to protect the wearer from that ""oh so icky"" black tarnish that can form on the skin under the ring. No such luck with this piece of crap. Not only did it leave the ""attractive"" black as soot band around my finger, one of the rings I ordered (I ordered three for myself, my girlfriend and our ""gay supporter"" roomie) was defective in that the band that is supposed to spin, wouldn't budge without great force. So, at the risk of sounding redundant, this ring, is crap. Go buy something that has at least the coating on it to protect your finger from the appearance of blackrot!

Very disappointing because I would have been more than willing to spend a few extra dollars on this to get a REAL STERLING SILVER RING. Buyers if you are looking for real solid sterling silver, don't waste your money here. I'm going to be very reluctant to purchase anything else from this seller.NOTE: you can even see the wear marks on the inside of the ring in their photo they provide! See the black smudges?!

After wearing it for a few hours around the home when it first arrived, I noticed the middle part of the rose had fallen out. I was devastated. Luckily, I found it and was able to glue it bad in place. Other than that, it lokos extremely good, especially for summer!Just like to add despite the fact that I glued it back in place, the centre part of the rose continues to fall off.

9913,"As in the other rings of same style from same vendor, I am very disappointed. The stones fall out immediately on first wear and they are not brilliant as one would like. Can not clean them as the silver goes dark, and since there is silver between each stone the ring is dull. I wore each of the 4 (diff colors) I purchased only once. So I would consider these disposable rings and will not be purchasing from this vendor again.

The return policy was a joke and I never got my money back. It does say on the return instructions that the company is not responsible if they never receive the returned product; which is why I sent it with delivery confirmation. I followed all of their 20 + rules (slightly exaggerating here), sent it within the limited time frame, and filled out all of the paperwork. Never heard from them again, when I called their customer service I am only told that they are not responsible. Go figure! I sure could have used that $60 for my wedding, hence the ""limited budget"". What I find most amusing is that they have no problem sending me product magazines every month, guess mail only works one way there. LOL Luckily I ordered it in plenty of time to keep shopping around before our wedding. What a disappointment though! I will never buy from this supplier again.

10338,"Makers of religious tchotchkes may want to make a rule for themselves: read the context of any verses you quote. This isn't a cute prayer telling someone you miss them and care about them. It's a warning from Laban to his nephew Jacob. Here's the surrounding text in a contemporary translation:Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, ""The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne? Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me."" So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. And Jacob said to his kinsmen, ""Gather stones."" And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. Laban said, ""This heap is a witness between you and me today."" Therefore he named it Galeed, and Mizpah, for he said, ""The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight. If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me."" (Genesis 31:43-50 ESV)In other words, Laban is giving Jacob a not-so-veiled threat: don't mess with my daughters, or God will get you!

10401,"I think that the seller might have tried to make this item look as though it was worth more in value than what it actually is, by advertising that it was marked down from a very expensive price. When in actuality, it probably wasn't previously priced for more than what I paid for it. You can believe me when I say that I would never have purchased this item for more than $20.00. But, it was claimed to have been marked down from around $100.00. I bought if for close to $25.00. In my opinion, though, the item is cheap in quality. The chains are thin and feel like they're easily breakable, and the two plates are so little and thin that, instead of regular metal they feel like di-cast metal. I was thoroughly dissappointed!

It is tiny and cheaply made of the thinest leather I have ever seen. The compartments are hardly big enough to hold the cufflinks for which it is made. The lining looks like flocked paper and the whole thing must be made of cardboard. Every bit of it screams cheap, cheap, cheap junk. I would return it but unfortunately, because it was to be a Christmas gift, I waited too long after receipt to check it out. It is now a total waste of money and I had to buy something in its place!

I emailed the vendor, explained what had happened and that I had not, in any way, abused the ring. Apparently breaking in half happens quite frequently with this item because they emailed back telling me that this ring is fragile. Well I was well aware of this little flaw by then, but it might have been nice of them to mention it before I purchased the ring. They also spelled out their return and exchange policies - both of which call for the item you wish to return or exchange to be in pristine condition. Well, since it's already in two pieces guess I'm S.O.L.The ring is inexpensive and I didn't expect it to be fantastic (I did think I would be able to wear it more than once though). What bothers me is the fact that the seller knew this ring was defective or just plain poorly engineered before they sold it and apparently just didn't care. Desperate to get a few bucks? That's pretty sad. With this attitude, I predict they won't be in business much longer.Bottom line is: If you're even tempted to purchase this item and you actually want to wear it - DON'T BOTHER, you'll be left with a tiny pile of pink rubble for your efforts. Of course, if you want to buy it for display purposes - go right ahead, it may stand up to occasional dustings, I'm not sure.

Upon inspection when I picked up the pieces from the floor of my car where I'd dropped them in disgust, I realized how intensely porous and fragile the stone was... maybe this ring should come with a disclaimer: wear gloves so that touching a steering wheel or a cup of coffee during a drive doesn't shatter it lol

The holder that comes with the unit is great, but that's about it. The water turned a little brown, but brown dirt was still in the grooves of the watchband.This cleaner is not powerful enough for real dirt.

14824,"I ordered this for my three year old so for her first day of preschool she could have a necklace with a picture of her mommy, daddy, baby brother and doggy inside. Instead I got a ridiculously cheap pair of earrings - I'm pretty sure they're plastic! I was so dissappointed and had to scramble to find another locket for my daughter. And now I have to deal with the whole process of returning the earrings and getting a refund. Nightmare!!

14837,"I am really disappointed with the earrings. The designer is not attentive to detail. A littleglue and small amount of silver and that's it. Also, they're too light weight and hardly make a statement.Much too expensive for the poor quality.Too bad, I was honestly looking forward to a beautiful pair of silver/orchid earrings.In all of my years as an Amazon customer, this is the first time I remain highly disappointedwith Amazon shopping.

14877,"We purchased this earrings for our teenage daughter based on the measurements listed on the specifications section. To our surprise the earrings were much smaller, maybe for a little girl. We purchased SecureHoop earrings before with the same measurements and are very happy with the size and quality. But in this instance we had to return them for a refund minus shipping charges. Even after we pointed out the incorrect specifications.

14883,"WISH some people wouldn't right reviews. The truth of the matter is the item is cheap. It's paperthin, completely bendable. And very small. Comes with no chain & it is in a cheap black ""velvet"" style bag! And to add insult to injury the seller charges $5.00 to ship you the piece of junk!! Not recommended.

14954,"a few days later I asked to see her new earrings.""I'm not wearing them"" she said.""Why not?""""They broke.""They broke, both of them at the clasp, the day after Mother's Day--the day after I gave them to her.

14955,"These hoops are flimsy and the clasps are terrible. I was looking for a pair of daily wear hoops. These are not the right choice. The clasps did not stay shut and the earrings would fall off my ears throughout the day, which is not a good look when you are in meetings.Alas, within 2 days of my new earrings arriving, one of them has fallen off somewhere and now I only have one. And since I'm not a pirate, that just won't do. I wasted $20 here and hope you don't do the same. Keep looking.

14960,"At first when i saw this item I thought it would be nice for a fun family filled night together out in the meadow. Then when I put them on they started squirted pee out on my twin daughters. It got in their eyes and I had to rush them to the hobo convention to recieve some medicine. Then on our way home the earings squirted out poop onto my husband and got on his foot. At first he didn't notice, so after a while he had a muscle spasm and got stuck with it. So we were going 155 mph in our brand new ferrari. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF TERD. IT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE PAINFUL AND STINKY.

So I bought one of each, a fairy with red wings, green, blue, well you get the idea. I regret buying them because the actual bracelet feels and looks like stainless steel instead of having a silver look. It reminds me of something that you can buy at a hardware store. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Bottom line- cute concept but poorly made.

I'm giving you it!My fiancee ordered directly from Evesaddiction.com because they had a free shipping weekend, where amazon would have charged.Unfortunately we made the mistake of ordering directly from them rather than through amazon.com.We had to cancel the order because we had came accross something and we weren't sure about it.. than after double checking we decided to contacted evesaddiction.com.they went ahead and canceled the order but had told us that we would need to re-order the rings since the order number was no good.We went ahead and did so, and after almost a week now.. not only have our rings not arrived yet.. the order that we had canceled turned out was never canceled and they charged our bank account twice and refuse to refund unless we ship back their product!I'm a little nervous about that because i'm not even sure we'll see that 53 bucks that was charged extra to our account even if we do send them back their package.You want my advice? Order directly through amazon... they would have taken care of this problem long before any of this crap happened.

I went to wear it yesterday for the first time and it broke right in the middle (just opposite the adjustable part) I was really upset!

If you get two earrings with super tight clasps, then your good to go!

It's absolutely identical, but not the real black titanium that Edward Mirell uses and that their parent corporation has the patent on.

15362,"In the past i have ordered so many items and amazon had always exceeded my expectations.For our anniversary, thought would order jewelery from amazon as we had liked their excellent service in the past (i looked for items from amazon store only under jewelry instead of amazon affiliates due to loyalty). The time estimate for this ring said 5 days, since i had 8 days to our anniversary, decided to buy.On purchase amazon sent an e-mail that its going to take 10 days, rigthaway I decided to cancel the order (as its few days out of my required date) and send a note to the customer service and they promptly replied back with a note that its already been shipped and can't cancel it.Now i was hopeful that it might arrive on time, but worst happened, it came as previously mentioned (11 days later). This is totally wacky, how in the world it could have been shipped and it took 10 days to arrive ? Even balance bar and stuff arrives within time where as key items that were promised to be delivered in 5 days can't be delivered ? I ended up screwing the anniversary and gave so many excuses not to have a gift (to my wife because of this) - i would never buy/recommend jewelry from amazon.The story is not over, they had shipped wrong size of this ring to me, so i decided to return it. There we go, the second saga of my experience, they received it and rejected it and sent back the ring (actually they rejected it on my second ring). Unbelievable worst experience from amazon.I usually don't write reviews or feedback, am writing this so people like me can at least think twice before they buy jewelry from amazon. If you're buying any jewelry, please go to a reputed store (online i had wonderful experience with other top 2 merchants along with returns). wouldn't recommend amazon, unless you have time and energy to test these folks (not worthy risking the occasion).

I mean really I was really hoping to have this amazing ring to get married with, but can't even do that with this ring. So I am just going to look for another ring else where, where the employee's will actually work to give the products to the right people and to that person as well as send it to get married in.

Underneath that is a simple 3 sectioned bottom. Best of all, no way to latch it, even my 30+ year old jewelry box had a latch, so be aware that the clip in front is just a swinging decoration, not functional at all.Pretty, but overpriced and usless if you want to keep things in it, forget about any sort of security, pick it up wrong and you will be picking up your jewelry. Today I discovered that although you get a real person when you call Oriental Furniture (shocking, I know), you get to pick up the tab for shipping the item back, and they insist on insurance AND a tracking number, seems like all you get to do is pay for a big bunch of nothing.

I requested the refund from Amazon rather than pursuing an earring replacement from Gem Avenue because after seeing the lavender/blue pair in person, I was SO not impressed!

On top of that, many scratches are clearly visible on both earrings, and - what is most striking - ONE OF THE EARRINGS IS APPARENTLY CRUSHED AT ONE PLACE!

The are very tiny. I was trying to guess what .59mm looked like, and my &#34;guesstamation&#34; was totally off. They also look very cheap, with not much shine for 14k white gold. Instead they look like sterling or stainless steel. I'm still flabbergasted! I am returning both pair for a refund.

16891,"My mom purchased the Leach and Garner version of these earrings from Amazon last year. One earring was recetly lost so I decided to order another pair from Amazon. I typed Leach and Garner into the Amazon search bar and this pair came up. They were supposedly the same (althought labeled as Duragold--Duragold recently acquired Leach and Garner)and looked so in the picture. The post does not fit in the clasp, so the earrings do not close.The post is also very long and hangs far beyond the end of the clasp; it looks like the earrings are just malformed. I was very disappointed and they are going back.

16913,"They have been sent back to Amazon for a credit. They had no weight to them and the fastener on one of the earings was so tight that it would have most likely snapped off after a few times. Obviously, they were not inspected prior to sending them out. My lesson learned, is to stick with books, cd's and dvd's.

When I went to return it they charged me a $18 restocking fee which is contrary to their money back guarantee. Don't believe or trust them. My CC company returned the difference because they found szul in the wrong. Don't be fooled. Be warned instead.

17083,"These earrings are very pretty, but the post is WAY TOO THICK. They killed my ears and I had to return them. I would guess the post is at least 2.5 times as thick as a normal post, and my ears did not like it!!!
",1
17085,"I was very disappointed in these earrings. They were only about the size of a nickel, and for $50 I expected them to be as large as earrings I have found from several other merchants for the same price. If you are looking for average size hoops -- say the size of a quarter -- these are NOT the earrings for you. I can only imagine how tiny the $30 pair is.
",1
17119,"These earrings were very uncomfortable. I'm not sure if it's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle--more like an angled bar than a round post. I don't have particularly sensitive ears, although I generally don't wear large or heavy jewelry, either. These earrings are on their way back to Amazon.I also wasn't thrilled to see how much the price has varied. When I ordered--4/6/07--they were $34.99. Some reviewers bought them for less, yet the current price seems to be even more.Caveat Emptor
",1
17132,"All I wanted was a pair of hoop earring, yellow or white gold. I've worn this style as every day earrings for years and managed to lose one. These looked perfect and in spite of the outrageous increase of the price of gold, I decided to order them. The size was exactly as described and would have indeed been perfect except for the following: the part that goes into the piercing is not the usual wire. Instead it is a thin flat piece of gold that is significantly wider in diameter than a wire and was terribly uncomfortable. If you are a person with stretched out piercings, this may not bother you, but it was a deal breaker for me. The second problem is that earrings like this must have a good closure. ONE of them had a very tight closure- almost too tight but I could have lived with that. The other was so loose that it would have definitely come unhooked and I would have lost it. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed. If you are a person who is used to wearing larger diameter earrings, I would say this could be a good deal if you get a pair with decent closures. They're beautiful and shiny and an excellent size. But if you're like I am and thick earrings hurt you, look for ones with wire style clasp backs.
",1
17135,"Perhaps, my expectations of $140.00 pair of earrings are too high. I love the look of these earrings and dropped some not-so-subtle hints to my husband that they would make a great Mother's Day gift. He picked up on the hints and presented me with the earrings this morning. I was pleased to see them sitting pretty in the box. Then, I took them out and I immediately told him they would have to go back. As another review mentioned, they must be hollow (or plastic?). My first reaction was that he was ripped off because the earrings really do feel like they are plastic. I told him to feel them (without expressing my concerns about the authenticity of the gold) and he immediately said they felt like plastic too. I haven't even bothered to try them on because they feel far more cheap than what I expect for this price. I'm not sure it matters, but there is no karat marking on the earrings either. I know that doesn't mean they are definitely fake, but the absence of the marking certainly adds to my reservations.

17136,"I purchased this sterling silver unique bracelet for my daughter in law and gave it to her this year for Christmas. When she put it on it cracked in 2 places on the edge and also cracked in the middle. It is very light and very thin metal and cannot be fixed due to a non tarnish coating used...so I am out $99.00. My fault though since I put it away as a present and it did not have any defects until she CAREFULLY PUT IT ON HER AVERAGE SIZE WRIST (the sizes stated on the product). It is just too fine a wire to be used in a bracelet. I also had the jeweler weigh the silver and it is 14.2 not approx. 18.3 as stated on product description.

17147,"I really loved these earrings when I first got them. I wore them probably at least three times a week for the last year.Pros:* Not overly expensive* Nice size* Pretty (initially)Cons:* Clasp comes undone very easily, have almost lost them many times* Pretty thin, could easily bend or dent* Only lasted a year before the gold plating started to wear offThe earrings still don't look too bad from the front, but in the back, where they rub against my skin, the gold plating has worn away exposing the base metal underneath. I expected better for the price... I've only had them a little over a year.I am extremely dissappointed in the quality of these earrings. I have a smaller pair of white gold hoops that I alternate with these that I've had for well over 10 years, and have had no problems with them.

17163,"When I received this necklace I could not believe it was in a plastic bag. After opening it the problem became quite clear. It was TIED in knots. I can't believe this was done in shipping. Someone had to tie it to get such a mess. It took me 1 hour, my son an additional hour, then my nephew a half an hour to finally untie it. After all that you'll see that when the other reviewers say ""Dainty"" they really mean small. The picture is really deceiving. I think this is going for $65 now. I paid $44 before Christmas on a Gold box deal. Wasn't worth the $44.

17181,"Unless your piercings are stretched from wearing heavy earrings, you may find these wide, flat posts too thick to pass through your ear lobes! One of my lobes had a pierced hole too small, although I have no problem wearing other earrings and studs. With my other ear, the earring post went through with no problem, however, it was heavy enough to give the hole a slit look. The earrings were well made, felt solid, not hollow and the price was good, but, they were not designed for me and were returned.

17252,"Don't be fooled by the ridiculous description of Duragold. These earrings are made of a rare substance commonly referred to as plastic. I am reminded of an old Bob Newhart routine where he referred to ""Diamacron"", the lustrous stones nearly as rare as glass. I bought these earrings for my wife for Christmas but there was no way I would give them to her. They are cheap in appearance and the lack of weight is a dead giveaway that there is no precious metal anywhere in these things. In any event, I can't comment on what the other reviewers are saying but I wouldn't give $1 (literally) for these, let alone $199. Caveat emptor.

So I sent the earrings back with a picture of the earrings that I had ordered. Finally someone got back to me in the mean time and said they would look into it. After a week, I wrote again stating that I hadn't heard anything and wanted to know what was going on. The reply was that if the earrings were in stock they would be sent to me and if not my credit card would be refunded. After a few days, I got an email from the same person stating that my earring would be shipped that day. A little over a week later, I got an email stating that my credit card has been reimbursed.

On top of that they didn't even ship it until after Christmas.I wasn't notified of this until I contacted them to get shipping information. Only then did they tell me they screwed up. I should've looked at their feedback comments before I ordered from them. It appears that I'm not the only one experiencing these issues.Thanks for screwing up Christmas, Pugster. At least now I know to no longer deal with you and I will advise the same to my friends and family.Edit; just received this today. I'm not sure what it is they sent me, but it's nothing like what I ordered. I ordered a brooch and what they've sent me is some sort of tiny multicolored hoop. Contacting them now to see if I can get a refund.If I wasn't convinced before that these guys aren't professional and are a tragedy waiting to happen, I no longer have any such doubts.

The pearls I received on both earrings are NOT Round or Oval for that matter. Both pearls look like a two piece snowman. The pearls are eggplant shaped and have a crease/groove running around them about 2/5 the way down from the top of them. Look at my uploaded photos to see for yourself.

The chain came knotted up with strands of white fuzz in the bag it came in. I have seen larger smokey quartz stones for less than $39.99 much less than the bogus $120.00 list price.The bail is too small to put the pendant on any other chain I own.

I bought this to give to my sister as a Christmas present...I honestly would be embarrassed to give this to anybody. I sent it back to Something Silver the day after I received it. I like some of their designs on other jewelry, but definitely question the quality. I doubt I ever order anything from them again.

This morning, less than 2 weeks since Christmas, my wife went to put it on & the c ring clasp broke. We took it to a jeweler to have a new clasp put on. I was not very happy but at least it broke when she was putting it on & not while she was wearing it. I also paid considerably more than the current advertised price. I would have expected a much better quality chain & clasp.

The cust. service agent asked me to contact the seller without reading through my explanatory notes.In the mean time I submitted feedback about the misleading image on yellow gold but reality was they were sending white gold instead.2. I contacted them the second time with the right order number this time. The agent asked me to send it back for a replacement. He didn't read throught my notes neither, since I explained I live outside the US.3. The third contact: I explained to them again (for the third time)that I would have to pay shipping charges back to the US and that was unfair since I already paid charges from US to my country for the wrong item. They said the item is advertised as white gold (of course! I submitted the feedback and they changed it right away!)and they were sorry but the only way was to send it back for replacement.I have purchased jewelry in the past from sellers and once I had an issue and they took care of it and I appreciated. I didn't have to do anything but report the issue. The other times everything was perfect. This is the second time I buy jewelry directly from Amazon, but I probably won't do it again since they are making me pay shipping and tax charges for something I didn't order if I want the right item. And if I send it back, I will have to pay again shipping and taxes from the US to my country.

While the detail on the rose is nice, it is angled downward so while the ring is in, you cannot see the folds and it just looks like a regular ball. The photograph here is very deceiving and taken at a bad angle to make it look like the rose is just tilted downward. When you look at the ring head on in the correct position, all you see are the green ""leaves."" As I stated above, it then just looks like a two toned ball at the bottom of the barbel and no amount of contortion will reveal the design while it is in the piercing. I then decided to try it on upside down so that the flower would be at the top so you could at least see the detail. It looked a little strange but better than before but the rose promptly fell off.

She teaches, and instructed that she didn't want anything expensive, as she expected to lose one or both of the earrings within the year. I shopped around and settled on these 1/3 carat earrings from Netaya.The folks at Netaya deserve some kudos here - their photography skills are outstanding, and their customer service folks are very efficient at putting customers on hold.The earrings arrived a week late, even with the express shipping that I paid an extra $10 for (not UPS's fault, they weren't shipped for 6 days). Imagine my surprise when I opened the box (a necklace box, about 3""x5"", ie huge) to find two of the dreariest looking yellow diamond earrings I'd ever seen.Not a great birthday when she wouldn't even take them out of the box. She promptly asked where I'd gotten them, and what the return policy was like.I called Netaya that afternoon, went through the customer service menus, and spoke to several CSRs, all of whom seemed surprised that I expected a refund of my purchase price, plus the shipping price (I paid for expedited shipping, it wasn't expedited, figured it was fair to ask for it back)To their credit, the little dreary looking earrings went back at their expense, and I was credited two weeks later with my full purchase price and shipping expense.I guess next time I'm sent for cheap earrings, I'll go to Walmart...

I thought about exchanging it for a fresh pair, but I was so pissed at the low quality that I returned them for a full refund.

In addition the amethyst gets dust buildup behind the stone very easily (dulling the color and clarity). I own other amethyst rings and never had the dust buildup affect the color and clarity of the stone before.

21852,"I bought this product quite some time ago and I'm convinced that it is the spawn on Satan. I absolutely HATE getting ripped off, so I guess I'm glad that it was so inexpensive, but I'm still very disappointed with how terrible it was. The ends are made out of cheap plastic; I think that says it all. It took a great deal of muscle to even twist off the cap. Your hands have to be in perfect condition, meaning not too dry or too wet, otherwise you'd be unable to twist it off even with muscle power. Once you get it off, you realize that you unintentionally destroyed the tip of your new navel ring because the plastic is so cheap that it chips with little effort. If the poor quality of the product weren't enough, the hideousness of it is. The shape seems like an interesting idea at first, but it looks awful once you try it on; it hangs weird and the only way it wouldn't is if you glue it, hold it in place, or stay in a stationary, seated position. Maybe some people like it, but I don't see how they possibly could unless they were packing several extra pounds in their stomachs. All in all, I would not recommend this product for anyone looking for body jewelry of good quality and appearance. Believe me, this offer IS too good to be true.*[The sparkly pink and blue ones are just as equally terrible, so DON'T BUY THEM!]*

Then if you closed it it will re-open, but if u screw it so hard together that that doesn't happen it will break.5 This Design gets easy stuck on cloth etc. so it's easy to hurt u.I had belly Button Rings for 7 years and i have to say that hole Rings with a click-ball and the standard Design are the most comfortable to wear and u cant hurt your self by getting caught on your cloth and they don't fall out easy and don't break usually.The ones which have a big rounding like a sun around the belly button look good on pictures but never when you wear them. On thin people they stick out on people with more fat they kind of mash in. And they are soooooooo uncomfortable especially when you sit. And they Stick out of your T-shirt etc.The ones with the hanging jewelery look very nice but can break easy if made poorly and i would just get ones with round hanging ends so they don't rip on the towel ofter showering or cloth.So i hope i could help you :)

To only be told they would have to call me back. I called them back. Just beware...order early!!! Haven't gotten the item ordered so can't review.

21902,"It only took Silver Insanity less than 48 hours to debit my bank account and send the electronic shipping information to the post office. That was about the extent of what they did regarding my order. Each email inquiry sent to them languished without response for nearly a week. It took them 3 weeks to finally say, ""We don't know what happened"" and to issue me a refund.

21906,"I found these on the Amazon website. I had some questions about the item and called Netaya. Since I needed to access their(Netaya) website for the item number I ended up ordering thru their website rather than going back to Amazon. That was 11/28/06. So far the item has not been shipped but my credit card was billed on 12/1/06. Needless to say am very upset. Left a message on their machine and sent them e-mail yesterday; waiting for response. I ended up receiving the earings , not sure if after Christmas ( 2009 now); were very nice and my girlfriend ( now wife!) liked them too.

No woman older than six years, will be happy with them.Photos on the website are deceptive. The backing is actually larger than the teeny-weeny stones.I ordered these as a gift, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone. Back they go to Amazon. Too bad they can't just be ground up in the Disposal, but they'd probably sift right through.

Correct me if I am wrong but Sterling Silver is not suppose to RUST!I literally threw the chain in the trash, it had rusted so bad. I even tried cleaning it with a jewelry cleaner with no success! This chain is a disgrace to Sterling Silver products of any kind. I went out to a local department store and purchased a beautiful 20"" Sterling Silver chain for only 10 bucks and it doesn't rust. The Gem Avenue Company is definitly not the place to purchase this chain! Shop around!Sincerely Disappointed

This tangling had to have happened during the manufacturing process, it couldn't have tangled that way on its own. The second one came out without an end ring with which to connect the chain to the spring ring clasp.The dragon itself was beautiful, and Amazon was very good and very prompt about handling the returns. However, I decided that the third time was not going to be the charm and declined to have it replaced yet again.

I'll still post this review, just in case it reappears for sale. The ""faux"" wood of the box had blemishes that would not come off, and the ""canned"" pseudo music box sound was distorted and did not even come close to sounding authentic. I sent it back the same day and I will compliment them on their efficient and fast return/refund policy. In truth however, if this ""music box"" cost me only 10 dollars, then I could have expected no more than what I received, but that is not the case.Avoid at all costs should this product re-enter the marketplace!

22919,"I purchased this ring during a sale with an additional 40% off, so I got it for $50. It still wasn't worth the money because it's ungiftable. It's very pretty at first glance, but a closer look revealed that the accent stones on either side of the center were extremely crooked and randomly sized. A couple of them had visible chips in their highly polished surfaces, easily visible under light. They look like random shards crammed into the setting. It's quite tacky when you look closely, and I'm returning it.I was very disappointed, this was supposed to be a Christmas gift and I was looking forward to giving it. The design and center stones are gorgeous, a tiny bit more effort in the manufacture to better match and straighten the accent stones would have made a huge difference in the quality of this ring.

I've bought $10 bracelets from Target that have lasted longer and held up better. Juicy Couture jewelry is terrible.I bought the gold starter bracelet because I wanted to wear a specific charm (the corgi one). After ONE wear, the gold color rubbed off from both the bracelet and part of the charm. Any part of the bracelet and charm that came into contact with my skin lost color and became a dull silver. I contacted the seller and was told ""it's not real gold"" (well DUH!!) and that there was nothing they could do about it. Because I was starting to wonder if this was a genuine Juicy Couture item, I brought it to a store and they basically said the same thing and added that it probably came off because I was wearing lotion..?? What girl doesn't wear moisturizer? Nice of them to blame the customer for their crappy quality. (Terrible customer service at the store, btw.)The good:- Looks cute....The bad:- Color came off after ONE wearing.- Expensive for the quality.- EXTREMELY poor quality.This was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. I should have spent the money on real gold or silver jewelry. Lesson learned. Never buy their overpriced, poor quality ""jewelry"" again.

What I did not anticipate was after the second time wearing it, without my son having a chance to break it, it completely broke on it's own when I went to take it off. This was either due to equipment malfunction that went unnoticed or a disgusting display of poor workmanship. Whichever the reason I would not recommend this product to prospective buyers.

23433,"Warning!!! The picture and the actual product is totally different. The pendant in the picture shows depth and quality of the silver, but when I ordered it, it was nothing but a very thin faux replica and the extremely flimsy piece that connects the pendant to the necklace can break allowing you to loose the pendant.

When I received the package I noticed that the return address came from only 40 miles from my address.

Oh and by the way they won't pick up the shipping cost for me to return it so I just lost $10 on this crappy necklace.

I've always had good luck ordering from Amazon, just not this time.

The image shows a dark gray sort of ribbed background; in the image the eyes are defined. The actual ring is nothing like the image. The eyes are not even there and the dark gray background is smooth instead of ridged. We may have accepted the ring if it wasn't warped but even then we were greatly disappointed. When returned, we were NOT FULLY REIMBURSED. So we didn't have a ring and actually lost money. Don't buy this ring. You'll be disappointed too.

24488,"I order from Amazon frequently, and am consistently happy with the products and service. However, I was very disappointed in this item--perhaps my own fault for failing to notice that no dimensions were given in the item description. I wrongly assumed that the charm would be approximately the size of my thumbnail, and was surprised when it arrived and I could barely find it in the tiny blue velvet bag that contained it. It is miniscule--1 cm long x 1/2 cm wide! The enamel is applied unevenly, and though the charm is tiny, it is evident that the enamel is thicker in some places, and contains air bubbles in others. It might be cute on a charm bracelet with a purse or shopping theme, but would not work as a pendant, as I had intended. I'm sending it back for a refund.

I tried them on a couple months before the wedding to wear to my bridal shower, but when I went to put them on, the actual earring broke off from the clasp. I was not rough with the earring, so I can only believe that they were made very cheaply. I guess you get what you pay for, disappointing but true.

24625,"After years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first time I've ever been so disappointed that I've had to return something.I bought this for my oldest daughter a year ago- it was just as pictured, came with a good chain and a nice velvet pouch. She just loves it and wears it every day. I ordered this for my younger daughter and it came today...it is NOT the same necklace. It's not even the same one pictured. The sides of the pendant are not filigree- it's solid and not very pretty. The chain isn't the same as pictured in the item description, either. Also, it did not come with the velvet pouch.I'm very upset that the descriptions (pendant, chain, pouch) are completely wrong. The quality also seems to be quite low compared to the first one I bought.I was looking forward to giving my youngest daughter this necklace for Valentine's Day. She wanted one just like her big sister, and I was hoping that it would be something she could keep forever.

24642,"I bought this on Thursday and received it on Saturday. I just opened the package today (Monday) and when I touched the necklace holder my fingers turned silver. I think that the seller just sprayed it with a silver color once I placed the order and didn't even give it some time to let the color dry. This can definitely ruin my necklaces and transfer color to my jewelry. I won't recommend to other people to buy it. I think that I will purchase a more expensive necklace holder to get a better quality!

I go on Amazon today and they still say in stock and they are even offering $50.00 off at checkout. Well isnt that special. Offering $50.00 off an iten and saying it is in stock when it is not kinda rubs me the wrong way. I needed these things and now I am screwed. I would think twice before orderng from this company.

The materials are 90% plastic and maybe 10% metal ( unidentified metal) all held together by two strands of what appears to be a mixture of rubber and thread. The feel of it alone reminds of a cheap bracelet you would get out of a 50 cent vending machine, the 10% metal being the cheer charms but the painted skirt, shirt and poms is plastic paint. I can't believe how dissapointed I was in this product, was suppose to be a christmas gift to my niece. I could pay equally this amount on a better quality charm bracelet from Brighton.

24992,"I really really want to love this necklace, but I just can't! I feel in love with it the first time I saw it on Amazon. I just loved the style, the color, and everything about it! I been contemplating for over a year to get it (I look at it a few time a month, pondering about getting it. I love it so much, but was a little hesitant to buy jewelry online. I even went onto their website and poke around) and watch the price go from $70 to $80 and then to $90 over the years. I finally crack and bought the necklace as a gift to myself and was super excited for the arrival. Well, lets just say it when downhill when I open up the Amazon box. I provided a few images so other people can see it.... I rarely get work up over a bad purchase, but this really made me upset! I had made countless purchases through amazon for the past few years and only returned two products...this is one of them.The jewelry box was fairly beaten up, with the corners worn out or crushed, which caused the side of the box to bend and curve out (if you look at the right side of the box). I could of overlook the issues, because the detail of the box was so pretty. However, there was a big bright yellow stain next to the necklace when I open the box! I can imagine someone missing the other yellow stain in the box on a time constraint or without a second look, but this one couldn't have been missed. As for the necklace, the pearls were not the lovely and vibrant peach, pink, white, lavender, purple, and grey showed in the picture. The pearl colors were a very flat light peach, cream, metallic grey. The pearls also look rounder and bigger than what it is in the pictures, which is some what deceiving. I notice a couple of the pearls had light scratches on the surface as well. The ""lariat chains"" were also longer than what was shown in the picture, making the necklace look really cheap and the pearls fake. The chain was also made from poor quality material (the quality was similar to children jewelry), which also surprised me. I had bought necklace for $15 with a better chain. As I said earlier... I really wish I could love this necklace, but it's just not happening. The shipment was quick, as I place the order on Sunday and got it on Friday. I gave the product 1 star, because of the beautiful box.

25424,"I'm wondering if the company Sabrina Silver shipped different products to different people, because my experience was right in line with the reviewers who said the earrings started out fine but then discolored and caused (mild) infection at the piercing site. At times I've had sterling silver earrings tarnish and was able to re-polish them with conventional silver polish, but these appear to have worn down to base metal, so it looks as if they were silver plated and not sterling silver at all. I have multiple ear piercings and typically successfully leave earrings in the upper holes without taking them out for cleaning very often, but it took about 3 or 4 weeks for these completely to deteriorate, and my ears are not particularly sensitive; IOW, I often do fine with dollar earrings!Yes, the style was exactly what I wanted but for something that didn't last and did not remain comfortable or wearable the price was far too high. However, I've bought other jewelry from Sabrina Silver that has been wonderful, which is the reason I'm asking if products got switched off in some cases.

Mine were not only discolored but the metal was corroding. I ended up with an infection in most of my ten piercings. Do not buy this product if you need silver earrings. I bought these because they stated they were .925 silver. They are obviously plated and are not what was advertized.

It looks cheap and I would agree with one other reviewer who stated that it would have been better to have 5 slightly larger stones instead of the 7 smaller ones. It spans too far across the finger and the sizing does seem to be slightly smaller than the size stated. Save your money for something better.

For the price of the ring I can deal with that though, I mean, what can you expect for $29? The worst part is that it's just hard to wear because it's not comfortable.

When you open the box, you'll be surprised how small this is, especially if you paid $85 for it (or even $60 in a Gold Box deal).I've always been wary of jewelry from Amazon, but this was an absolute disappointment. I'm surprised that anyone could call this tiny chain 'masculine' looking.

I recommend that you purchase items of this type at a store so you can test them and not waste money on shipping. I would give this a negative 1 star if possible.

I think I could get it on my wrist with help but it would fit tightly with no give or flow at all, making it look silly.Keep looking at the other bracelets and skip right past this one.I'm returning mine!

27086,"Although this is a gorgeous piece, the cross is in fact NOT sterling silver. When I first picked it up, I could tell it had a lighter 'feel' to it than all of my other sterling silver pieces. (and believe me, I've been buying sterling silver for years)The marking on the cross indicates .928, and there is in fact NO such grading for sterling silver.I even put a magnet next to this piece - it immediately stuck to it just as regular metal would.I then took this to a jeweler who told me it was sterling silver PLATED, and NOT sterling silver.One more thing - upon first opening the clasp, the lobster claw hinge fell completely apart.It was very disappointing that what COULD have been a gorgeous piece of jewelry was in fact just silver-plated metal.

27340,"I'm really disappointed with this purchase. I thought the ring looked beautiful online but when it arrived it's in person appearance was much lower quality than the picture indicated - it just looks a bit cheap and tinny. If I'd seen the ring in person, $35-40 is probably the most I'd pay for it. For almost $70, I expected a high quality product even if it was sterling silver and CZs.Still, I wore the ring out and got quite a few compliments on it so would have been inclined to give a more positive rating if one of the smaller fake sapphires didn't fall out THE FIRST DAY I wore the ring. I definitely wouldn't recommend this vendor to anyone nor will I buy from them again - which is really too bad - they have a lot of cute jewelry designs.

27404,"I think the pendant is absolutely beautiful but I also agree that is does not sit properly on the neck because of the large back on it for the chain. If that was made smaller it would look better. Unfortunate that a simple design flaw can ruin the entire thing.

27526,"While I was trying to mount the Jewelry mirror on the wall (doing some leveling and adjusting work), one of the tip of the nail which located at the edge and the back of the box made a lot of scratches on the wall. It is not supposed to be stick out from the box - badly quality control. After mounting the mirror on the wall, I found the two screws with the wall anchor is not really matched because the mirror was very loose on this two screws (no problem on the third screw because it was on the wall stud). I can easily take out the wall anchor after taking out the jewelry mirror and now I need to replace a better wall anchor and/or screw!! Finally, I made a call and nicely complain to the SEI and they hand up on me!!! Okay, the jewelry mirror may still good to use but just be aware the above problem.

They worked well for 2 weeks and then my ears started bothering me. I wore these 24/7. Other people have mention the discoloring on the post of the earring. Mine were not only discolored but the metal was corroding. I ended up with an infection in most of my ten piercings. Do not buy this product if you need silver earrings.

27632,"If I could give zero stars, I would. The leverback hooks for the earrings are different, very noticeably DIFFERENT. One is so much larger than the other, as to be very noticeable when worn. When I put them on, one earring hangs lower than the other. Even looking at them, the other hook is wider. It would be so much money to send them back that it isn't worth it, since they were 8.50 on sale. I will likely just throw them into the trash. I don't know how much a jeweler would charge me to get a leverbacks matching in size. The pearls actually match fine..., though.Not sure I will ever purchase from this seller again, unless it is an item that does not come as a pair.--an update: This seller sent another pair and they match this time, but they are NOT the dainty leverbacks you see in the picture. They are rather large, and bulky and not at all the way picutred here. Save your money.

That lightweight feel you get when you hold a 50 cent ring from the store machines.I have had it about 2 weeks and both rings have already begun to tarnish.Overall, I would definitely not repurchase and I caution anyone who is looking for a wedding ring replacement or a ring to wear daily not to purchase this ring set.

28123,"!!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!!!When I received this set, to say that I was disappointed, would be a gross understatement. I was disgusted! First of all, the ring was damaged/defective (whatever you want to call a mess up). The center stone was improperly set and positioned within he prongs. It was crooked. And I assure you it was extremely obvious. It didn't take any close inspection to see. It was glaring. Then the prongs themselves were also bent down in mismatched places on the stone, one being bent straight down the side edge of the stone vs. pointing relatively toward the center. This only added to the overall impression of the stone being crooked. It made the stone look as if IT were misshapen and cut wrong.I get that you can't expect fake jewelry that costs $30 to be the same quality as the real deal... But this? It looks like it came off the $5 carousel at walmart. And frankly, I wouldn't have bought it from there, for that price. It looks like crap. It looks like a gumball machine ring, or something that could have come out of a little girl's dress up set.Now, even had the prongs been set properly, etc. I still wouldn't have worn it. That just added insult to injury. The ring, had it been in perfect shape, still would have looked like something from the dollar store. It doesn't look anymore ""real"" than a peice of glass stuck in a plastic band. The silver even looks funny. It looks like tin foil. The reflective sheen is a dead give away.The stones don't look like diamonds at all. They don't even look like good immitations. They look like cheap junk.Also the center stone is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to large to be believable. On anybody. It's about a 3-4 ct. stone. It looks absurdly fake. So unless you think that your friends might actually be able to bring themselves to believe that you could afford a $15,000.00 ring, then ummm yeah it'll be too big.And if you can pull that off, then maybe you can also convince them that you know, all good metals are as shiny as tin foil, too.Don't get this ring. Don't waste your money.BTW.. I found a beautiful, well crafted and believable ring for a little bit more $$$ (but still at a VERY decent price) at [...]

28202,"I was pretty sure what size diamond I wanted to replace. I just did some research online to determine if the color and clarify listed would be sufficient. Once I received the diamond (J-K Color, I3 Clarity) it looked like it had a piece of thread on it. I wiped it off with a soft cloth, looked at it through a jeweler's loop, which I just happen to have in my desk, and saw realized that thread was a huge inclusion throughout the top of the diamond. It could be seen clearly with the naked eye and not using 10X magnification as the learning guides say. Realizing my mother can't see very well and time was too short, I gave it to her for Christmas anyway. I just hope she doesn't let anyone with good eyesight see it up close.

It arrived a royal tangled knotted up mess. I worked at trying to get it apart for a few minutes but finally gave up. A blown Christmas present. Thanks Amazon. From what I could see of it, the quality is about what you would expect for the price. The clasp was thin-cheap-o along with the chain that held it all together. Once again, there are things you should NOT buy on the internet. Jewelery is one of them and Amazon should know better than letting the temporary Christmas help do the packaging not mention marketing of Christmas ""specials""..

Very aerodynamic I'm sure, but you'll break all your fingernails trying to pry it open.

28837,"I ordered these for my GF and had to then ship them to her for her birthday as she is in another state. I should have known better. A friend once told me you CAN NOT get a deal on diamonds, they have an inherent value. You can definately over pay but you can't get a deal. So if you are looking for a deal, this isn't it. You get what you pay for or even less in this case.I should have known better and not mailed them, but I didn't have time to go shopping.The diamonds are small;I knew they would be. I am not complaining about the size.They are dirty diamonds. They have several large visible inclusions. They have absolutely no sparkle. I went outside and was hoping to get a little sparkle. Nothing.She was very nice when she got them. She didn't complain and was very thankful. Then one day we got into a fight and she told me the truth. She cried when she got them. Not because of excitement. But because she thought I didn't love her enough to get her something nice. The truth is I lost my job and really can't afford anything more. She wore them only once when she went to her Birthday dinner with her family. She was embarrassed. No one commented at how beautiful they were. In truth, because they are not.These diamonds are not gem quality. I do not think Walmart even sells diamonds of this low quality.Save your money and buy something else. There are hundreds of other items on Amazon.

28854,"The quality is simply terrible. They were so cloudy, you almost would have thought they weren't even diamonds. Also, one of the two had a black fleck in it too.

28855,"DO NOT BUY THESE!! I bought them for my son's girlfriend for her 18th birthday. I find it very hard to believe that any jeweler would even sell these! They were literally grey with absolutely no sparkle. I read the mixed reviews, and hoped for the best since the price was so good, but I wouldn't give them to an 8 year old! Needless to say I now have to find something else to buy--I would never in a million years give out these earrings, not even to a child. They also didn't even come in a box--just loose in a little blue bag.Amazon should not even be selling these!

These are UTTERLY the worst looking diamonds I have ever seen, even for $99. I am not a diamond expert but a diamond should not a have milky white color.The good thing is Amazon makes returns easy...

28880,"I returned this item immedately upon receipt. Although I realize that the pendant was not as large as the photo shows, I was shocked to see (more accurately, I was unable to see) the size of the stone. A peridot is a SEMI-PRECIOUS stone, so, for $45.00 the stone should be larger than the tip of a ballpoint pen. This pendant should be priced at around $20.00. Amazon needs to include an 'actual size' photo on this type of item or they can expect a large number of returns.

28886,"I used gift cards from family to purchase this ring. I had it on for one day & the Citrine stone fell out. I just think the quality of this ring is poor, rough edges on the gold, and stones that were not set right.

28898,"I got this necklace at a Friday sale for $35. Even with this discount price, I returned the item right away. The onyx pendant is the size of a small pea, and the silver finishing is defective with a significant area of ""bare"", unpolished spot on the tiny pendant. With this purchase, you are getting less than what you paid for.

28906,"When I received these earrings, I was delighted. They were just what I wanted. However, after wearing them for a few weeks, one of them had a major discoloration on the back portion. It was not normal tarnish, which one might expect from sterling. Additionally, I was experiencing extreme irritation, which might suggest that they are not as ""sterling"" as stated.With much disappointment, I ended up throwing them away.

It had fallen onto the tile floor and a giant chip had broken off of the ring. I've never had a piece jewelry break due to an accidental drop. If you do decide to purchase this ring, be very careful since it seems to be more fragile than described.

In reality they are an only an inch long and the stones are very small as well. They kind of look like children's earrings not something for a woman. If I had seen them previously, I never would have ordered them.

Upon receipt, I discovered that the clasp would not stay closed, even with the 2 ""figure-8"" safety clasps, neither of which would clasp properly, either.

29510,"Don't bother ordering this item because you will be sorely disappointed. I ordered this link and my card was promptly charged, but the link that was sent instead was an ""angel"" link that was completely different and only priced at half what I had been charged. Pugster does not answer the customer service line during their posted hours, and when they do choose to respond to emails do not want to address the error of having sent the wrong item. Pugster finally decided to respond and send a replacement only after I had to have Amazon intervene for a refund, and the replacement link was STILL wrong!!! I now have 2 poorly designed angel links and no music note link. Unbelievably poor service. Product received is not even close to what is represented in the picture - not even music related in any way. Company refuses to admit that there is an obvious error in their warehouse. Definitely not worth the time or hassle of ordering.

Sadly, one of those pearl earrings fell out and she lost it. So I bought her another pair for Christmas. She had them in for the day and now her ear is having an allergic reaction to them. I don't know if it's true 14k gold or not because the first ones didn't do this to her. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UGKP8M/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 were the original ones I purchased in May. The only difference between the two are the color of the gold, size of the pearl, and quality of the pearl. I'm not happy that this caused her ear to get infected.

The nose screw was not flexible at all, and the plastic was not smooth. The plastic all up to the top of the nose screw was babrbed, thus making it painful to put in and imposible as well. To make matters worse, when attepmting to bend the nose screw for inscertion, it snapped in half. I am completey dissatisfied with this product, and reccomend going to peircing paghoda or walmart and purchase a nose screw of better quality and at a better price.

I was looking for a very small but wide huggie earring and going by the dimensions thought this was the pair I had been searching for, it was not. For anyone looking for a wide silver huggie earring, Stuller makes a great quality product and worth the extra $$.

The symbol comes from the way a Guinea worm is removed from an infected person's body. It's rolled around a stick and removed slowly over weeks or months. One worm...not a snake...on a stick without wings.The Caduceus is a totally different story with a different origin and was mistakenly used as the medical field's symbol somewhere in history.

No matter the quality of the garnet, it looks like a complete fake because the silver around it looks like tin! The detail of the mold is very good, but again, the silver has no glimmer, no weight.I cleaned it with jewelry cleaner and there was no improvement.

Contrary to the picture, the low relief portions of the seal have been filled with some type of dark enamel to increase contrast. This enamel sticks STRONGLY to wax, resulting in either the enamel coming out on the seal or the wax adhering to seal. Either way it is impossible to get a good impression.2.) The metal used for this seal softens in hot wax, causing the design to distort.This might be a nice piece of costume jewelry, but it is not a wax seal by any stretch.

30982,"I guess I shouldn't have been disappointed but I am. I purchased it because I am a very small person and I thought that this would be the perfect size. However, it's much smaller than it appears. I wear about a size 3 and the 3-prong diamond barely covers 1/4 of my finger. The gold does not appear to be 14k either as this is really light-weight and a very light yellow shade. I almost thought that I bought a white gold band. This ring has a very flimsy feel to it and it's cheaper than I would have imagined. Not to mention that the ring was an imperfect circle. I wouldn't be surprised if it bent if I squeezed it. I am even more disappointed because Amazon did not send a certificate with it like they did when I purchased my previous ring. I do not recommend this ring to anyone. It looks dinky and you're better off purchasing a 1/4 ct solitaire. This ring just doesn't look right.

Only positive is that it arrived on time. Pathetic.

31077,"I have a disappointed little girl who received this for Christmas from her grandma. It arrived in a box with the necklace in a velvet bag, a KNOTTED necklace. So even though she wanted to wear her very special necklace from grandma it had to wait until I had time to unknot it. I attempted to gently unknot the necklace using a pin and even though I used no force the chain still manged to come undone at the clasp. The clasps are incredibly tiny so it is going to be close to impossible to 'fix' this so she can wear it and honestly, if it broke so easily it isn't really sturdy enough for a child to wear. We are terribly disappointed and in no way can I recommend purchasing this item.

Most of the diamonds had huge scratches in them, and a couple of them were completely crushed. Although nothing was wrong with the sterling silver hearts and the piece was heavy, I had to send it back for a replacement because of the diamonds. The piece they sent me as a replacement was much better, but many of the diamonds had noticable scratches on them. I will never purchase anything from them again because I believe their diamonds would be low quality like the jewelry they sent me.

I emailed the company and never recieved a response back.

31971,"I should have read these reviews before actually purchasing this to clean my jewelry. First, the water didn't do anything. I bought a cleaning solution. Second, the 3 minute cycle wasn't long enough to clean out the gunk between my diamond and setting. I ran the cycle 5 times (for a total of 15 minutes). Only then did my jewelry come sparkling clean. Third, you have to change the cleaning solution often ... which makes me wonder if it's really the solution that's doing the cleaning and not the ultrasonic. Fourth, as I was cleaning out the basin, I guess some water seeped inside through the cracks on the side (the outter shell is like 3 pieces of *CHEAP* plastic put together). Well, guess what? It stopped working. I know it's my fault but c'mon, this is ridiculous. Those reviews about the flimsy build ... totally correct. Oh well, it was great while it lasted. I'm off to by the Sharper Image ultrasonic when I'm down in the States.

I took it back and now I'm searching for another ultrasonic cleaner with better reviews.

31989,"I bought this knowing that there are very few home ultrasonic cleaners that can do the job that manufacturers describe they can do. I was right. This one failed to vibrate any dust or residue off from my dirty KEYS, let alone rings and necklaces. The power is just too weak. I have used an industrial-powered ultrasonic cleaner on anything from watches to rings to eyeglasses, and the effect is amazing! After a couple of items the entire pool of water became muddied. When I used this ultrasonic cleaner on a handful of jewelry, the water remained pristine.My advice is unless you're willing to shell out $500 for a real ultrasonic cleaner, you're better off just going to the jeweler to get your jewelry cleaned.

31990,"First the cover to the on/off buttons fell off. I didn't mind because it still worked (left button = on, right = off). Then the bottom came loose from the rest of it. It still worked, so I still didn't mind. I just held it carefully from the bottom. Finally, the bottom fell all the way off, wires appeared (one of them was severed), and an important looking piece broke off and sprang forth from its innards. Now it's in the trash. .P.S. These things happened during normal and non-traumatic use. All I have done is press buttons on it and take it back and forth from the cabinet.Edited 10/20/06I bought another one of these hoping I'd just had a lemon. Nope. Second unit is in the trash.

Pass on this, and buy a cheap electric toothbrush instead.

Just three or four of them, but the ring itself looks already used. Also the stone is a little lighter than in the picture but I can deal with that. Overall it is a beautiful ring, but I just wanted a nice, CLEAN, new ring to give to my friend for Christmas. And nobody should have to specify they want something clean hen they're ordering it new! I'd understand if I bought this used off of some website like eBay, but amazon? Come on! Amazon is going to lose me as a loyal customer if they keep this crap up! I shouldn't have to return an item for being dirty! I am thou roughly disgusted and would give it ZERO stars if I could!

33137,"I purchased five of these bracelets to give as gifts. I wondered how the bracelet that was pictured could be sold so inexpensively. Now I know - the bracelets that I received are nothing like the bracelet this company represents in its pictures. The photos show an actual San Marco bracelet with fully formed, individual links. What I received should be called an ""Illusion San Marco bracelet"". There are tiny ""links"" that are actually only about 1/3 of a true San Marco link - just the side of a link. Think of cutting a length-wise piece off an elbow macaroni so that the piece is rounded on the outside and hollowed out on the inside, and you'll get the idea. Plus, they packaged the bracelets in such short, narrow little plastic bags that each of the bracelets has an odd bend or kink in it. Of course these are going back, and they have left an extremely poor impression.

33343,"I bought this ring despite the 2 negative reviews claiming the silver was tarnished. I frankly (sexistly) deduced that both negative reviews were made by men, who perhaps didn't know much about jewelry. I have to admit they were right. The 'tarnish' that they refer to isn't tarnish at all, but more like a wearing away of the metal - it can't be rectified by polishing the ring. It's definitely not silver, which is disappointing, but they've cleverly stamped the '925' (a symbol on sterling pieces) onto the inside of the ring. I'm also relatively certain that the 'onyx' is plastic as the facets are dull and look scratched, but can't be sure about that. The ring still looks relatively cute on, and I may keep it because I bought it to wear with a specific dress to a formal event, but very disappointed that I spent $35 on something that could have very well come out of a vending machine.

You would be better off getting a ring out of a gumball machine. Luckily Amazon has a good return policy for these things.

33451,"I bought this ring a year ago for my husband. I thought I was getting a great deal. I mean how can you go wrong?! A $375.00 ring for $110.00. When I got it I was alittle upset. The white gold is VERY thin. I couldnt believe that they had such a high retail price on this ring. I would have gone through the roof if I paid full price for this ring.Now my husband does love his ring but there are problems with it. The setting for the Onyx is not well done. In fact after a few months of wear the stone starts to get loose and you can hear it whenever you move your hand. With the gold being to thin it is easy to dent. Now the problem is that if you are to take it in to your local jewelry store to have them work on it... Well, they cant. So this ring is nice... But understand once it's broken (my husband's had a crack in the white gold) that's it. You cant take it to be repaired. So I would say, spend a full $400.00 and get a custom one or one from a local jewelry store and get a service plan on it.

I LOVED the design of this ring, and loved wearing it because it received so many compliments!HOWEVER, it started to tarnish very quickly and after nine months, the stone had started to loosen. Last week, somewhere between home and work, the prongs bent and the stone fell out. I was very careful not to wear this ring in water, when using household chemicals, or when doing anything that might have caused damage to the ring (like gardening or moving furniture). While I recognize that this isn't exactly the Hope Diamond, I wish that the ring would have lasted longer than (almost) one year.My partner ordered a new ring for me from another company, and made sure that this time the ring was made of sterling silver NOT brass.

IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE IMAGE SHOWN! I am beyond disappointed & honestly would like my money back. The ring I got was blackened, very poorly crafted, bent, dented, cracked, scratched, crooked & looked like it had been burnt to a crisp before it was sent to me (which is to say besides being mostly black all over, there is a coating of rough black substance quite like hardened soot on it).I've had some bad purchases before but this is by far the worst. Sometimes variations in the expectation of an online order are tolerable like size or color....maybe even design and style but this looked like they beat the crap out of it deliberatly before they sent it to me. I will never buy from this seller again & strongly advise against others doing so. Seriously save your money and buy elsewhere

The water heated and vibrated the jewelry a bit, but did not really get anything cleaner than shaking it myself in a container of liquid jewelry cleanser. It definitely did NOT deep clean anything that I tried, and still required that I scrub the ""crevices"" of my rings. I also found that the OFF button on the one I ordered did not work. The timer worked fine and stopped the process of cleaning, but in order to turn it off I had to unplug it...not a great feature in something where your hands might be damp after retrieving your jewelry. I added dishwashing liquid, as suggested for a more thorough cleaning, but it simply sunk to the bottom of the tub. Even after trying to swoosh it around and get the best result possible, it was no better (in fact not as good) as using a toothbrush and simply scrubbing my jewelry as I had in the past. I had numerous silver chains since I own a small jewelry business, and these looked NO different after even the longest cycle was used. I find that treated jewelry cloths are far superior and I will continue to use those. I had hoped for a quick, easy way to get things clean, but this particular not-so-ultrasonic cleaner did not do it. I have returned it for a refund since it not only disappointed me with its performance, but I felt it was a bit unsafe with the OFF button not working as well.

For the past 6 months, never had I felt any difference.I agree with other reviewers that you are just getting a piece of copper wire in a plastic box with a shoelace.What's up with reviews telling us how this little plastic box fixes all their problems? What's up with overwhelming number of people marking them as ""helpful""? I guess I will just remove my review to let people waste their money in peace.

Plus the color sent was not the color shown...it shows blue, I got pink. now I am stuck with a bracelet I could not give as a gift and had to rush out at the last minute a few days before Christmas to find something else. Needless to say, I will not be buying again from this seller. It's not even worth it to return it...the shipping ($8) cost almost as much as the bracelet did plus I'd have to pay returnh shipping as well. Highly disappointed!!!!

35152,"Got this in the mail the other day, and as it is a gift for my fiance' for Valentine's day, it has not yet been worn. I can tell you it is VERY LIGHTWEIGHT, almost seeming TO BE VERY CHEAPLY MADE PLASTIC. Not sure if I will even give it to him actually. It IS NOT worth the price as it feels to the touch and in weight to be a CRAPPY bubble gum machine tow. That was a surprise. I tried it on my own wrist ( I am a 5'7 150 lb woman) and while it is a little big on me , of course, I think it MAY actually fit my guy just fine without any adjustments. Will see. But it's not overly large ( in wrist size, as I saw a reviewer describe. That reviewer was probably a very thin guy. We are athletic and larger people, but not fat by any means. Describing it by my/our sizes.)I will not buy anymore titanium from this seller, only because I think their so-called titanium is a garbage fake copy. I have my doubts about the metal used. But I don't think I will return it. I just feel like I should now buy something now that's actually nice to throw in with the Valentine's gift. Seems this bracelet should be around 20 bucks. It's not. It is very shiny in tone, though, and somewhat of an eye catcher , until you touch it. Kindof embarassing. Hope it doesn't break after he's worn it for a couple days. Feels exactly like cheap plastic. Can't say without having it reviewed by a jeweler. Too embarassed to take it into a jeweler. Lol. Oh well.P.s . UPDATE: Decided to give this thing unwrapped to Dan early and not even excuse it on Valentine's day. He tried not to laugh, but was gracious ( and it's way big on him too).He HAS titanium and agrees THIS IS NOT. Couldn't be.

35359,"All 6 pieces were very poor quality. I realize the set cost next to nothing but ""you get what you pay for"" holds true once again. The clasps had no springs in them. No way to keep them closed. The first - and only - time I tried to use one, the necklace fell off two times before I could leave the house. The company refunded my money with no problem, but they did manage to get in a dig at my attitude. I was told that ""we have sold hundreds of these sets to satisfied customers"", so, in essence, what's wrong with me? I just don't like to get ripped off. I found a local jeweler who made extenders for me - at a cost of about $10 each, and am much happier.

I bought an extender in the mall at one of those earring/costume jewelry store for $5.99 that looks and is made much better, goes perfectly with my white gold chain. Chalk this up to a learning experience.

The ""gold"" turned a very dark brass color after approximately 2 days of use. Also, these are quite large chains. They're a lot bigger than your average pendant chain so if your necklace gets turned around on your neck, the extender will be very obvious. I took a picture to show the discoloration & size, but this particular product or vendor doesn't seem to allow for customers to share their photos. Red flag.I like the size options included in this set, but you'll have to wear these with your hair down or a collared shirt to hide the discoloration and/or large size.

I put the 2"" (gold) extension on and it looked great, but an hour later I felt my neck and the necklace was gone! Thankfully I ended up finding it, but when I looked at it closely I could see that the clasp on the extender didn't close fully and the eye of the necklace chain slipped off the extender. I would rather wear the necklaces too short than risk losing them all together again.

I ended up giving my mother cash out of desperation (how tacky!).I've purchased a couple of rings through Amazon and was very pleased but, I would hesitate before buying another necklace. It is too difficult to tell the size and some necklaces (like this one) do not give the measurements of the pendant (and the chain was extremely flimsy). At the same time as this purchase, I also bought my sisters a ""Mom"" necklace (not this same one; a silver filigree mess that was just that; a mess.)

Some things should not even be sold unless an absolutely full disclosure is made in describing them, without using typical marketing euphemisms such as ""dainty"". These earrings resembled tiny flecks of aluminum foil. I really felt hurt and insulted that anyone would claim that their value was so high and that the reduced price was a mere $119.99. And when you hear the word ""diamond"" and pay over $100.00 for a pair of earrings, don't you think you should at least have them arrive in a pretty velvet box? Regardless of the product desciption of the packaging, I know I deserve better for my money, and the tiny pouch only added insult to injury.

I wrote to Silver Speck and received a reply from Brenda that the pearls were 4mm but if I was unhappy that I could return them and my account would be credited with in 5-10 days.I wrote back that the time involved and cost of mailing was not worth the cost and that they indeed were 2mm and sent a photo of the pearls next to a set of 4 mm pearls laid on a metric ruler.She replied the same as before.I see no reason why they should not pay for the shipping as it was their (error?) mistake.It is a sad way to end an business relationship.

All together I recieved the wrong package back 3 times and finally paid for shipment just so they wouldn't charge my credit card. After calling customer service they told me that they had given me all the discounts they could, I'm not sure what discount I got but I don't remember it!

36828,"I was very disappointed in this piece. I am not familiar with Sajen and purchased this as a gift for a friend. The pink fiber optic glass is not as iridescent as I would have thought. The jewels look inexpensive and the overall piece looks like it could have come from the costume jewelry section. I got this on sale, and I can't imagine this being worth the regular price of $99. It looks cheap and even at 70% off, I don't think it is worth the money.
",1
36831,"I thought this would be great as a conversational piece as it looked so unique. Unfortunately, I was expecting something long and skinny as the picture appeared...(The width was not stated.) This thing was just HUGE and FAT across width wise and NOT appealing at all! The fiber optic also had little ""dings"" all over it, adding to the ugliness. The silver, although substantial, was scratched badly in the back upon arrival.Even with 70% off, I agree with the other poster; it is not worth it!
",1
36850,"I love the idea of a modern design for a cuff - my mother has many, yet they are always on her birthday/Christmas/Mother's Day lists. It arrived today in a nice velvet drawstring bag but that's where the ""class"" ended. The bracelet had no weight whatsover and the design is such that it could be easily squished. The photo on the website doesn't show how the ""interior"" is poorly seamed. This definitely does not have the look or feel of sterling silver. It seems like a bracelet one might buy at Target for $12 - $15 as a funky accent piece, $45 is WAY to expensive for a piece of this quality. Cheap, cheap, cheap!
",1
36851,"Completely cool idea, but very badly executed. It doesn't fit well, and feels like I would break it very easily. I returned it the same day that I received it.
",1
36852,"I had very high hopes for this bracelet, as I purchased it as a gift for my Grandmother. A friend of mine purchased two of these, and I thought it was quite odd when she told me that she wanted to get one of them reshaped. Amazon clearly has a quality control issue, as the bracelet I received was very deformed. I looked like it was flattened from what should have been a circle shape into an oval. I could wear it, but I would have to concentrate on how I held my wrist all night long. Any motion of the arm at all made it fall off!On a topic I know people don't approve of, the packaging was horrid. The bracelet was forced into a box that was obviously too small, as it was taped shut. Also, it barely fit in the velvet pouch it came in. Amazon should be relieved that this is not the only piece that I have purchased from them, because if it were, they would no longer get my business.
",1
36853,"I was seriously disapponted in this bracelet. It is completely unwearable. The bracelet should be in the shape of a C with only a small opening for the wrist to slip in and remain secure. This is not the case here - this bracelet is in the shape of a U and falls off with any slight movement. If you intend to sit motionless all day, then this is the bracelet for you. For the rest of us...keep shopping.

36928,"I had read the reviews on this necklace and it seemed that it was what I was looking for. After receiving it, I was disappointed. The design and the size where fine but I felt the metal the medallion was made of was inferior-I would have been embarrassed to give it to my sister. I would be cautious in ordering jewelry in the future. I have used amazon many many time in the past and this is the only time I have returned an item because of the quality.

37123,"I bought this ring because I wanted something I could wear all the time and not worry about losing it or damaging it. The design is a good idea and had potential but the center stone is too big and it is set in a way that makes it look like it came from a quarter machine. It has a ""childs ring"" look to it. It's sparkles beautifully I just don't like the way it sits. It just looks fake! They also don't fit ""together"" as closely as I think they should. Maybe it's just my taste, but I don't like anything about it. A lot of others think it's perfect. Just depends on what you like.

37378,"Does anyone really realize what they're buying here? Black diamonds are really crappy diamonds that have been placed in a nuclear reactor. The black color results from the diamonds being bombarded by intense neutron radiation. This makes the diamonds radioactive, and have to be stored until their radioactivity dies out. Only then are they sent to market. The main point here, however, is you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear--in other words, ""Garbage in, garbage out.""
",1
37383,"I was a bit concerned about buying jewelry online but decided to give it a try. I had originally purchased some smaller diamonds and was satisfied with them, but returned them because they were too small. I decided to go with larger diamonds and was extremely dissapointed when they arrived. The clasps were both bent and scratched. The stones themselves were severely scratched and worn. I swear it looked like someone went to an arts and crafts store, bought some supplies and threw together some cheap earrings. I will never be ordering jewelry online again. Complete waste of time and money.

37396,"I did not expect high quality stones due to the price, but I certainly didn't expect such horrible quality.Both stones and dull and extremely cloudy. They also have huge inclusions right on their surfaces. They are gray in color (not close to black as shown in the picture). One is darker than the other. Even though their color would hide most flaws, the quality is so obviously poor it would be embarrassing for anyone to wear them.I also would like to note that the white gold settings are not as shown in the picture. The stones are propped up on top of settings so the white gold cannot be seen on the perimeter when viewed directly from the front.I ordered them a couple of days ago but now when I view the item, it says ""Item under review"" due to customer feedback. I'm guessing other customers have complained about being sent two lumps of coal too!!Returning immediately. Not worth more than $10. You're better off buying something made of plastic from a bead store.

37400,"I have already sent these back to the seller. When I received these earrings, they looked like they had been scratched and along the prongs it looked as if there was glue, or maybe they were just really dirty. Either way I returned them within 10 minutes of receiving them. I later found out that Black Diamonds are just that way, unless you buy high quality, basically flaweless, this is what you can expect to see. With that said, these earrings were too flawed for me to give to my wife. I thought for the price it was a steal, but turned out to be too good to be true. On a positive there wasn't any hassle with returning these.

Very upsetting and I couldn't find it anywhere!! When I called amazon to try and get help they said since we didn't get any warranty on it that they could't do anything for me. So now I have a ring with no diamond. I am very unhappy with amazon for not helping me! They shouldn't sell jewelry that falls apart after only a year. Wish they could have helped me more.

They are the cheapest-looking earrings--the silver was tarnished in certain places, giving a ""patchy"" look; the posts weren't soldered on correctly, so they stuck out at weird angles. DO NOT BUY from this company! You will regret it. Amazing they can get away with it.

He has tried to wear it without the cross but he can't. When the cross is not inside the ring, the are where the cross is supposed to be is soo soft that it squeezes together and misshapes the ring. Please don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful ring but his was apparently defective. Everytime he takes the ring off the cross flies to the ground. The cross itself is very sharp around the edges. Hope others have better luck !

37909,"When I firs got this ring ( earlier than the delivery date whichwas good ) I noticed that it looked a little cheap and the inner cross was not connected to the ring and fell out. The ring was a little tight, even though I know I am a size 9 ring from many other purchases. I decided to keep it, being cheap and all, but was going to take it off because it matched nothing I currently wore. When I wet my finger and tried to pull the ring off, the ring broke. right down the center, right out of the box. Seriously, spend the 18$ and get a tungston ring from world jewelry center....they dont break.

Especially around Christmas time - they stock a lot more for the holiday season.ps: This is my first negative review (I feel that strongly about it).

But I was willing to pay the price (plus shipping) for 2 sets of what appeared to be beautiful cloisonne pill boxes to give as Christmas bridge gifts to my friends. I am now embarrassed to give them. They are not well made, they are heavy, and they do not open and close easily. I will not be carrying one in my purse, which is what I intended to do.

38136,"The product itself is great. Held lots of different sizes, stored nicely. Unfortunately, however, the hinge broke immediately which I didn't realize until AFTER I hung up all of my jewelry. When I packaged the return, I noticed another crack in the acrylic. The package went from the mail immediately to my soft couch so it wasn't from mishandling. I am torn, I would love to get this product again but I don't want a product that I need to treat like delicate glass.

38137,"I really like the way this organizer looks and the number of earrings it should hold, but it turned out to be a major disappointment. It is fine if your earrings are on posts, but if you have many which are on the u-shaped hook, they are very difficult to mount on the display. Between the small hole and the distance between the hole and the outside edge of the acrylic the U hook on many of my earrings could not be threaded through the hole. I ended up re-drilling some of the holes and enlarging them, which helps, but the screen is poorly designed.
",1
38153,"I found it so frustrating that this product arrived broken! Evidently others have had the same experience with this product. It was cracked throughout and the hinges did not even work. My husband suggested it might still be usable, but then I showed him how sharp the cracked areas are...not safe in the least. Perhaps it's no coincidence that this item gets less expensive every time I go to the page where it is sold on Amazon. It's horribly made. I paid $15 and now it's being sold for $12. It started around $30. I think they should pay you to use such a bad product.
",1
38174,"I really don't recommend this product - it is quite bulky, so not really useful for travelling, big, and not very attractive (looks very cheap), and does not seem very strong. I gave it away as soon as I received it, and ordered a normal one with less hole but which looks much better. I would advise not to buy this.
",1
38196,"I was very disappointed by this item. Yes, it folds and appears to be sturdy, but in reality, it also unfolds and collapses quite easily. There's something about plastic holding up over 120 pairs of earrings that now makes me nervous because you'd be surprised how much 120 pairs of earrings actually weighs. When this unfolds and falls, earrings break. Also, the holes are drilled very close together which makes taking off post earrings difficult because not only are you trying to balance the holder, you also have to pull off earring backs in too small a space. This was what I was doing when my display unfolded and fell flat on my dresser, cracking one of my crystal earrings and dislodging a stone from another. I now use this display only for wired earrings and purchased one of the metal harp displays to hold my post earrings. The metal displays were so much more stable and cost only a few bucks more.
",1
38199,"I loved the idea that this earring tree folded. All the decorative ones take up so much space. But as other reviewers have noted, the constuction is shoddy and the design is poor. The holes are too small so it is a struggle to get earrings on and off of it. If I can't get a pair of earrings in a moment, then why not just keep them in an old fashioned jewelry box? But worst of all, the thing tips over very easily and the first time it did, it broke. Taking my earrings off to return it, it tipped again and broke in another place. Waste of time and money!
",1
38232,"Looks to be a great product if only it arrived in one piece. Every single hinge was broken off each of the panels. Amazon would not do an exchange. I had to do a complete return and new order which is an additional 2-3 week process just to get the item I want. So much for this being a Christmas gift....thanks Amazon!

38299,"I bought this ring and was so anxious to receive it. When I opened the package, it was just as it said very beautiful. Unfortunately within 2 days the ""Rose"" coloring started to come off and by the 3rd day the stones were all clear white!

38306,"I was disappointed with the quality of this product the minute I opened the envelope. This is actually the first time I've ever been unhappy with a product that I have ordered from an Amazon vendor. I based my decision to buy this product on the photos made available during my search and I feel that the actual charm looks very little like the photo used. The charm itself looks cheap and scarcely resembles the photo. I'm not convinced that it is sterling silver. It also failed to include a clasp to connect it to the sterling silver charm bracelet that I bought from a different Amazon vendor. (Btw...I am very happy with the bracelet itself.) I paid more than $25 for this product and I feel that the quality is worth about half that. This is the first Amazon vendor that has let me down.

The metal it is made from is extreamly frail and is easily bent out of shape. Also, once apart, the ring never sits right again even though I have put it back together correctly.

I don't even know, it's for my girlfriend so its a smaller size, not like other puzzle rings where they're bands of silver these are like each individual rings connected like a puzzle ring. I've searched the site that the receipt is marked for; silver insanity to no prevail of finding the ring on the site to look what they price it as. Out of all the things I have bought for the holidays this year this is what i was really looking forward to to have some mineral covered in silver makes this a straight lie to sell as ""sterling silver"" if planning on buying this for someone i say don't do it. I look at reviews and decided to buy this for all the positive reviews this ring has received but it sucks. This ring is honestly a piece of junk compared to some puzzle rings I've seen and I don't now the prices so i can't say it may good for the price but i would have rather spent the extra money.

38677,"I was very disappointed when I received these earrings I ordered from Amazon. They are very small and the ""turquoise"" background is actually plastic with a small piece of turquoise mounted to the metal (not silver).

Besides that it arrived almost 2 months later after their shipping estimate. Due to my location (Ukraine) it isn't so easy to send it back, and I can't even explain how angry and disappointed I am.

38968,"I know, what do you expect for diamond studs that are so inexpensive, right? Well, I expect them to look like a matched set, no matter how mediocre the quality. One earring was clearly smaller and narrower than the other--more of a rectangle than a square. I have resorted to wearing one in my second hole on one side only, because they look dumb as a pair.
",1
38975,"Very Very Very upset with this order. I loved it when I got it, but it fell off my wrist three times the first week I had it on. Then it finally fell off and stayed off. GONE.........so what the problem was is that the clasp was cheap, and it wouldnt stay on my write, so Im pretty annoyed that I spent the money and I lost it in a week or two. Wasted my money, and loved it. I wont order off this company anymore, because they have to know how cheap the clasp was, they are selling them to alot of people. I for one, use Amazon so much, its crazy. I spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars every month. This is the only piece of jewelry that I ever purchased that I had this problem with, so that tells me that most of thier jewelry is like this, and that is why It was the price that it was, because it was cheaply made, problem is you can sell cheap stuff, but for gosh sakes, does it have to be so cheap that it falls off all the time, in the long run the money just falls off your wrist.

38976,"I love this bracelet, but when I tried it on right out of the box: I could not fasten it to put it on, it did not lay flat when my husband fastened it for me--and it took him a while too. And it took a long time to get it UNfastened. I've seen clasps like these on other bracelets--and they never work--or you break them the first time to try to get them off. I'm disapointed something like this --woudl sell too at $44, with such a poor clasp design. Do not buy it, you will be sorry, and it will be a waste of money. I returned it immediaely for a refund.

I was also very pleased that I had received it earlier than the estimated date. Unfortunately, the next night I took it off before going to bed and my thumb was green. I am very disappointed because it was such a nice ring and I was looking forward to wearing it all the time. I have bought several rings from this particular seller in the past, (7 all together to be exact), and wear almost all of them everyday. This was the only one that has ever turned my finger green. Very disappointed.

Second, the links between the flowers are so small that the necklace kinked and was hard to straighten- it would be a nightmare every time you tried to put it on. Finally, the lobster claw clasp is so tiny that it's almost impossible to open. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by- I'm surprised that Amazon, whose products I order routinely, would carry such an item, and thankful for their return policy since I returned it after seeing it within five minutes of the package delivery to my house.

The color is way different from what it looks on the picture as well, much brighter.

39462,"I originally gave this ring an excellent review. My fiancee bought me this ring @ 1 year ago. I loved it. Then, suddenly the stone fell out. I tried to contact the company, sending them several emails which were never replied to. Yesterday I took the ring into a business that repairs jewelry and they told me 3 of the 4 prongs of this ring were garbage. My stone had been held in essentially by one prong. To repair my ring was estimated at 300 dollars!!!! Do not waste your money on this ring. I loved it, but now i am left with a stone and an empty setting...not what I expected!
",1
39465,"This is a Genuine sapphire solitaire ring.Pros:-You do get a really large sapphire, which is great.Cons:-Setting prongs are not very symmetrical - not too much care was taken to set the stone.-Setting is shown on the photo at the most flattering angle. In fact the setting (actual metal ring) is very thing, and much thinner than on the photo. I'll estimate it is 1-1.5mm wide and 1-2.5mm thick.-The stone is very dark. Very dark indeed. I have looked at the sapphire in very bright daylight, and only then was able to see the blue colour as clearly as on the product photo. More often than not, the stone looks black.-With sapphires, the darker the stone, the cheaper it is.Overall:The manufacturer of the stone has pictured it at the most flattering angle and setup. In reality the stone is very dark (dark-dark blue, almost black), and the setting is very thin. Unfortunately this is not a good deal. It is not a ripoff either, as you are getting a large stone. You do get what you pay for, and it's by far not a bargain.

Obviously not solid, this is feather-light and started accumulating dents days after it first started being worn. And despite the '925' stamped on the inside, I doubt this is real sterling. It scratches far too easily.Still, it did look nice at first, shame you need to treat it like it's made of glass to keep it that way. I would have given this two stars if they didn't lie and claim it's solid sterling.

Read others reviews and saw that they don't answer any emails, attempted anyway and to no avail. Shocker. So, I'm stuck with a craptastic ring that I paid money for. I would suggest not using them unless you intend to give it as a gift to someone you wish the worst for.

I buy many of my purchases on Amazon because of their open, honest, reviews; Amazon even posts those reviews that support buying from other sites, such as Costco. I was looking for a replacement Sterling silver .925 beaded, quality bracelet that would replace her lost Silpada bracelet. This bracelet, in my opinion, could have come out of a ""Cracker Jack Box"". Certainly not worth the $30 with ship that I paid! The bracelet arrived within one week, but it feels and looks like plastic. Also some of the beads were sticking together and I had to pry them apart, like they were sprayed or something! When I shine a light inside of the beads it is white, not silver. And the weight is very light, I measure .2 oz or 6 grams which feels very light to me. Also, where is the .925 stamp that is advertised on the Amazon website? I would not recommend at all. It is going back... pronto!!!

40197,"These are very cheap looking earrings. There was no COA/certificate which, on a ~$1,000 diamond pair of earrings seems very strange to me. The clasp on the pair I received was bent, and the prong on the other earring was actually slightly crooked. The diamonds didn't look like G-H near colorless to my eyes as they seemed to have a yellowish tint, but I'm no grader so I can't take that part as too much of a negative. Of course, that is part of the problem -- there's absolutely nothing that states what these earrings are or that they are in fact VS2 grade. There is no certificate, no IGI, not even a basic COA. (There's also no hallmark on the earrings -- I guess because they are too small? Which means they could even be white gold and cubics...)Overall though, they just look and feel cheap -- and that's the real problem. I returned mine.

I don't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not, or if they were and I just didn't see or pay attention to them, but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it's meant for a very young child. The necklace may be 18"", but the pendant itself was so small, not at all what I was looking for. So i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece. What I was really wanting was a larger, heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult. Never have found one yet.

Well let me tell you I just received this ring today and it is HORRIBLE! You cant see through any of the diamonds because they are are not I2/I3 these are ALL I3 diamonds and the worst possible I3 they could get their hands on! The color is NOT J/K they are like O/P again the worst ones they could get their hands on! The J/K I2/I3 rings I had tried on at the jewelry stores were really nice looking and you could still see through the diamonds and they werent yellow!!! Dont waist your time just go for a higher quality diamond. I am now stuck 1 week before my wedding without a wedding band because a company doesnt do quality control on their items and just takes peoples money thinking the general consumer doe3snt know any better. Pathetic! At least Amazon is being kind enough to try and get my replacement in on time before the wedding. Lets just hope it works or else I wont be getting a ring placed on my finger at the altar. =(

40420,"As an internet based jewlery business, American Pearl has a 30 day return policy. This is necessary due to the fact that you cannot see or feel the jewlery in person and you are buying based on photos.I ordered the Shooting Star earrings and they arrived in about a week later. Unfortunately my fiancee didn't care for them. I returned the earrings for an exchange (10 day turnaround to ship back, process, and recieve the new item and received the second pair). Again she did not care for them.I then started the return process. You need to get an authorization number to retun the item. Unfortunately they are only available between 9am and 5pm M-F, which due to a busy work schedule, took me a few days to reach them for a RA#. I shipped the item back and waited for the refund to hit my credit card.The entire purchase/exchange/return took 33 days. Instead of a refund I received a store credit. I called an explained that an exchange took place on the original item and should therefore extend the 30-day policy so that we could have time to recieve and assess the second pair of earrings. They stated store policy was 30 days regardless of the number of exchanges.This is not appropriate -- nor explained anywhere on thier website. It was also not explained during any of the phone conversations that occurred.Buyer beware...

I returned everything to Gemavenue exactly as they required it. With no update or response Gem Avenue, they sent BACK the defective, broken rings.

Imagine my delight when I unpacked it on Christmas eve and discovered the the hardware required to assemble the product was not included in the box.

None of the hardware was provided.

However when putting it together we noticed the left front door hinge was not installed correctly and when assembled in factory the person or machine ended up splitting the particle board with the screws. So we sent that unit back and got another. This unit came in again really quick and packaged nicely. Once again the left door was damaged by the hinge, wood actually split. Coaster has no Quality Assurance or Quality Control. These units look nice but Coaster needs to unpack then when they arrive from China and inspect them. Again Amazon did nothing wrong in fact I am impressed with Amazon for they way they handle returns.

I've waited until i had the money to put into this and when i received the pendant, i could not be more disappointed. I had originally bought it for my mate and had it shipped to myself to put into a necklace i was making him.When i received it, the front was very nice, shiny and looked like what i had paid for. However if you turn it over, the back is not filled in, and the stone and claws that hold the stone, jut out that back extremely far. Not only that but they are very sharp to have against your neck or chest. It easily digs in. For the price this item is selling for it was extremely disappointing.For something i had waited so long to buy its nothing as good as in the pictures. I added my own in good light and with a white background behind it so you get a very clear picture of the pendent.Now the seller was worse then the item. no response from emails for over a week, no number to call. I had to open an amazon A to Z claim (the very first in 3 years) and they finally replied back with a prepaid shipping label. No notes or messages, nothing just the label. As of this time, its been 4 days since it was received and no refund, however its only fair to give them a full week.All i can say is if you truly want this item, get the one that is fulfilled through amazon so returns are much easier if you don't like it.

42695,"Who's ""Zina"" ? I buy a lot of quality sterling silver jewelry - and have never paid prices anywhere near the prices of this brand - All of their jewelry offerings are production factory made and for the most part you can find either identical or nearly identical pieces at local brick and mortar stores for 1/3 or less of the price.Save your big $'s for pieces that are artisan crafted, individually made, artist signed pieces.

Todate I have not received the item and my credit card company has not been able to get a response from the merchant as to where my item is. The item was for a child's birthday gift. The merchant charged my credit card immediately, but has not made an attempt to responded to inquiries as to where the merchandise is. My personal opinion is this is no way to do business and if you provide poor customer service people should stay away from the merchant.

Yet it is still listed as ""in stock"" on Amazon.

43100,"I have owned several puzzle rings in the past as well as purchased items from this seller before. I would simply warn you to be very careful about purchasing an item from them (as I will be very careful in the future- if I ever do purchase from them again). My husband purchased this ring for me for Christmas at my hinting and prodding. We were NOT pleased when we saw the condition of the ring on arrival. It's appearence and overall design was VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE PICTURE THEY HAVE SHOWN. The bands were very thin and flimsy- not a good characteristic to have if it is a puzzle ring. Especially in a soft metal- like silver: thin bands can easily be bent. If they do become bent - the puzzle will not be able to be put back together again. BE CAREFUL- LOW QUALITY, DECEIVING PICTURE!
",1
43101,"As the lady described above I also was disappointed in the ring! It is a beautiful ring when it is together but the bands are so thin that they bent while I was wearing it (before I even was able to take it apart). I am extremely thin so I don't have fat fingers as described above and the ring was extremely hard to reassemble! Especially since there were no directions provided with my ring. The silver is not pure .925 silver. I am highly allergic to metals that are not pure .925 or 14K gold so I was disappointed with the quality to say the least! I have purchased other items from this seller and the same thing happened with them also. So I have jewelry that I am unable to wear! The silver is also tarnishing rapidly! I have been unable to clean it with silver cleaner. I am very disappointed with the quality of silver of my items!I have other jewelry that is .925 silver and have been wearing it for a decade and it has not tarnished, bent and it is not flimsy at all! I love .925 silver and have a hard time purchasing it as it is rare to find. I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news but I would not purchase this or any other item from this seller and would not have kept this ring but it was a Christmas gift from my husband so I am keeping it because of him!

43223,"I find out later on 8/26/12 from Jeweler that this necklace is not Sterling Silver. They put a lobster clasp on necklace with 925 on it, and even the clasp is not!!! Very upset, sending it back. They make you pay postage and it goes to some person with a P.O. Box it's not even a company!!! I may be out postage but hopefully my comment and others will have you seriously consider another maker If you don't want to lose out on time and money. They said Sterling Silver, it is sooo not !!!

When I opened the box, saw a small piece of metal ripped off from the chain and there's just a piece of metal holding the both ends of the chain. Moreover, it is not sterling at all. I wore it for just a few days and its not gleaming anymore. A diamond cut usually gleam. This is NOT. I wish I could return the item but it is just a waste of time of sending this back and wait for the refund or replacement for more days. I am not just happy with the item.

43398,"I'm extremely disapointed because it seemed from other reviews that the product was good. When I ordered it, I paid for a stainless steel cross pendent, on a chain, with a DIAMOND accent. WHat I got was a stainless steel pendent on a chain with the letters STEL imprinted on the front where the diamond should be. To make matters worse, this was a christmas present for someone who lives quite a distance away from me. now he has to send it back to me so that I can return it. I am so unhappy with this
",1
43407,"I just received this in the mail today and the pendent's quality was not what I expected at all. It appears too much glue was used during manufacturer, leaving glue visible between the silver border and the stone, on the edges on the stone itself, and all around the backing. Glue is clearly visible when looked at from both the sides and straight on, and was the very first thing I noticed when taking it out of the package.The twisted silver border is far larger and more prominent then it appears in the product image making the stone appear much smaller. Not a good thing when the entire pendent is smaller then a dime. The stone itself is a nice mint green with a very light the marbling effect that is only noticeable when viewed from very close up. The pendent also came with a good quality silver chain. Very disappointing since the product image is so lovely, but I will be seeking a refund from Silver Speck.
",1
43409,"I had to return this pendant because the quality was very poor. The photo makes it appear to be made of thick and heavy silver, but it is actually thin and cheap. I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it. WARNING: I was led to believe that it came with a chain because of the photo, but the product description does claim that the chain is not included. I would stay away from this product. They did return my money, but I had to pay the return shipping.

43417,"I had high hope about this product, especially after reading good reviews. I have similar earring from high end store in white gold and they don't have in yellow gold, so I bought this one from Amazon. The earrings looks really cheaply made. It looks more like ball head pins for sewing and it's really sharp but I think, what a heck, it has safety back, so I put it on and I wear it for the night. Guess what? The next day my ears are in pain. I guess because it's so sharp in the screw area, it cut my earlobe! It take 3 days to heal my earlobe. Right away I took it out and returned it! I can't believe it! Good thing it's me, not my baby!

Obviously not solid, this is feather-light and started accumulating dents days after it first started being worn. And despite the '925' stamped on the inside, I doubt this is real sterling. It scratches far too easily.Still, it did look nice at first, shame you need to treat it like it's made of glass to keep it that way.

Mine is pail and the one in the amazon photo is like a deep blue. The color is not that bad but the size kill it for me. Also the chain is really thin and flimsy.

I guess my 11 year old niece can have it.Also, the feature that is most prominent on the back of this pendant is the big ""MADE IN CHINA"" engraving. It really adds to the value..The longer I write this review the more cheated I feel. There is no way this item was ever over $40! It's worse than the quality you would get at Walmart for $15. The ""sale"" price is nothing more than full retail.

45693,"This earrings display is definitely not worth the money and detracts from what you are trying to sell. It is flimsy, the plastic scratches and breaks easily. Mine broke during assembly before I got to use it. It will surely not hold up to customers rotating it around by the tips of the thin, brittle plastic arms and it won't be their fault. There are metal ones out there that are more attractive and cost less. Do yourself a favor and skip this overpriced piece of junk.

At first, I chalked it up to my 2-year-old being a little rough with it and put it back together with needle-nose pliers... but when it broke several times during prayer (when I was doing nothing but mindlessly fingering each bead), I realized that the rosary is just not meant to be used.Bottom line: the rosary looks nice, but if you'll be using it frequently, I would definitely recommend finding one more durable.

46676,"I got this from amazon and returned them, the emerald color was a very soft shade of green, more like jade not emerald green. I bought this and the matching pendant, the pendant on the other hand was beautiful, the emeralds are very rich and dark and looks much more expensive. If it hadn't been for the color of the stones, I would hace kept the earrings. (Just in case, I just ordered this earring again, hopefully I will get ones that match the pendant)
",1
46678,"Aside for the fact that these earrings were TINY, the quality of the emeralds was appaling. The 4 C!S of gemology are cut, clarity, concentration and carat. The emeralds were a weak solid gray, in fact they looked like poor quality jade. Shame on the manufacturer, and shame on Amazon for missrepresenting these earrings.

46687,"Not what I expected. I lost the backing to one of the earrings within 2 wks- it was always a little loose. I would rather buy something like this at a store so I can inspect the merchandise. Better luck next time...

I was saved a big embarrassment by examining the gift before giving it to my fianc&eacute; in front of her family.2. No certificate of Authenticity of the gold Studs or the Sapphire (as was advertized to accompany the item).3. No Lifetime Warranty Certificate (as was advertized to accompany the item)4. No Gift Message (as I had requested during ordering)Perception is reality. And right now I can't even be sure of how genuine the product is by the sloppy and careless way the order was handled.

46701,"These earrings do not look blue at all - the sapphires are so dark, they look back and little light gets through the stone, even if you shine a flashlight on them. The posts are very thin and bend way too easily. Returned these and looked for a better quality item.

46704,"They shipped quickly and are very large stones but they are so dark they literally look like onyx. For $200, I'm disappointed. I bought them because the only other studs my wife has are diamonds. My wife likes these, they are a great size, but I know I would be happier if they actually looked BLUE! I probably will not buy sapphires online again. The pictures people have posted of these look nothing like the stones we received. I guess there is just too much variability in sapphires to buy sight-unseen.

It is in a ""sueded"" pouch, in a box filled with cotton, wrapped in bubble wrap, inside the small shipping box, so trauma during shipment should have been pretty minimal. The stone was in the ""sueded"" pouch, but, when the next one falls out, will it be as easy to locate? Would a replacement arrive the same way, or would it at least be thoughtful enough to be looked at once before losing stones?

46815,"When this ring arrived, I was impressed with it's size, considering that I paid just under $60.00. There was a great deal of gold, and the semi-precious gem stones were of good size. It might have been a pretty cocktail ring. Unfortunately, the picture and the ring were not the same. The picture has stones that look light and well-coordinated. I had no idea what kind of stone my ""blue topaz"" was because it was a dark, teal green in color. I couldn't tell the difference between the amethyst and the garnet, which were practically identical. Overall, the colors and arrangement of the colors, made the ring look depressing and cheap. Even the gem stone baquettes above the stones gave it a look of poor design, something not evident in the picture. I'll have to send this back -shame on the designer.

Only this one is still missing. When I asked them (Sabrina Silver) what happened, they just said that the shipment must be with the local customs here in Hong Kong. Mind you, I wasn't born yesterday. If the shipment is still with the local custom, how come all the other shipments (they were actually rings & accessories also) arrived so swiftly and NOT this one?

218,"Beautiful ring, but with ""made in china"" printed quite clearly on the inside of the ring, it doesn't seem like the best kind of gift if it's supposed to mean something. Another review warned me of this tacky attribute of the ring, but I thought, ""there's no way a 2mm ring could visibly have those words printed on its interior!"" Well, I was wrong.
",2
230,"This was not what I expected, but for the price, I should have realized it would not look like an expensive ring. The stones were very, very small. It was returned.
",2
237,"After about a week of wearing it one of the stones fell out. Other then that it was very pretty. But i cant wear it anymore.
",2
254,"Well charms certainly have changed. No time to reorder something else, I gave this as a give, but it embarrassed me to do so. Sooooooooo tiny it almost went out with the wrapping. No room to engrave even a year on it. Purchased in White Gold the price was not cheap, but I'm sure the gift came across as a gum machine trinket. Too Bad . . .
",2
296,"I had originally written a review about this ring after I received it. It was a good review because I was happy at the time. HOWEVER I just had to edit my review because I have only had this ring exactly a week and one of the longest arms or w/e it is broke off!! And dont be fooled the stone in the middle is not like that it is a very small stone in a cone type thing and also it was a little hard to adjust the first time. I will not be purchasing anything else from this company. The only reason it is 2 stars is because I DID like the ring at first.
",2
302,"these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this!
",2
353,"Love the design but the raised relief on the band itself is very sharp and catches on clothing and can easily scratch skin.
",2
355,"This ring looks great online but once I received it I was disappointed. Maybe it's because I only got one but I was not happy with it and I must say I will be returning this item. It looks so much better online than what it did when I got it. In my opinion even if I would of bought more than one its not worth the $ that they are asking for. This seller does have a very nice presentation when u receive your package and you will recieve your purchase within the promised time frame.

367,"The stone was far larger and the band far thinner than depicted. I opened the box and was very disappointed with what I found.
",2
381,"This ring is ok for the price. Very light weight, band is very thin. Actually bent band by just taking off. Ok to wear to add a little bling. Wish it was better quality - I know, you get what you pay for. Looks like my 7 yr old niece is getting a new ring.
",2
405,"Was not satisifed with the quality, cute cheap earrings. I gave them to my teenage daughter. I paid more for shipping then i paid for the earrings, but i guess what you pay for; is what you get. Cheap.

418,"I have had my nose pierced for years and I am pretty used to purchasing nose pins/rings like this but I have never been so dissapointed. Had I known that the quality of this piece of jewelry was going to be so low I would've saved my $10.99+expedited shipping, spend a little more and got a real nose pin. The last nose pin I had got old and was due for a replacement, I found this one and bought it but as soon as I got it I thought this must be a joke because it was by far the smallest nose ring I've seen (it wouldn't fit my sister who has a small nose).I have never been dissapointed by bodycandy before so don't let this review reflect your opinion of their company or service. I always receive my orders quickly and I have never been dissapointed with their jewelry before but this piece was laughable.

458,"This anklet was really pretty. I liked it and wore it all the time. Then, it was made so cheaply that it broke. Not good. I wouldn't recommend it.

472,"The sterling on the ankle bracelet turned black almost immediately. Unfortunately, I had thrown away all of the shipping info, otherwise I would have returned it.
",2
500,"These earrings are not worth more than the $5 I paid, but they are cute and the company shipped all items promptly. The ""dangle"" part of the earring above the colored beads look like cheap plastic beads stacked on top of each other.
",2
501,"This item is priced well, but it is WAY too small to engrave anything on that anyone could read - not to mention that the back is not smooth, it's 'pebbly'. The best use for it is to hang it off an existing medical id bracelet near the clasp, so that if the face plate is turned around, the caduceus is visible.

528,"My husband and I were a week away from getting married and still could not agree on our wedding band set. We came across these and instantly fell in love with them.. I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched.. I thought titanium was the strongest metal and that if wouldn't scratch... The seller is trying to work with us to make us happy.. I guess we'll see.

535,"It serves the purpose, but it seemed to me that the image was a lot prettier and sparklier than it turned out to be. I wear it UNDER my shirt since it does not compliment anything I wear.

548,"I really like the bracelet but the clasp won't stay closed. I have lost is two times and have found it both times. I have worn copper bracelets for years and they really work for arthritis. I am very disappointed in the clasp and would like a solution for this problem. Help!
",2
560,"THis product looked nothing like the picture. It was very small and did not sparkle. I had to purchase other earrings, instead.
",2
569,"Item is very good looking in pictures but in real life it's lacking allot. The crystals are not very clear and several have fallen out and the tip already has a crack in it, I expect it to fall off withen a month or so. Save your money or find some thing else.
",2
570,"Photograph of the item is stunning however; upon opening the package the actual item looks extremely small. I have a hard time believing the before discount price is correct. The included gift box is small, and feels cheap. If I could have seen this item in store before purchase I would have passed.

599,"I've had it for 3 months and that ""antique-look"" is discolored and all except one gem has fallen off. I guess this is good for you if you like disposable jewelry.
",2
603,"This ring is supposedly designed so that you can wear it with the tag hanging down (as shown) or in the reverse with the tang hanging from the top. In the latter position, the tag is quite heavy and the slightest motion causes the ring to protrude up which stretches the hole a great deal and makes it very easy to snag or see through clothing. In the position pictured, the ring will not fit at all in any size piercing because the tag is actually curved and bows out. The barbell is not long enough to accommodate this curve and the tag will either pull the ring out or flip over so it is upside down. Certainly not worth 19.99 nor even 1.99.
",2
612,"Wolf Dream Catcher is actually smaller than pictured. While it is nice, one must look closely to figure out what the medallion actually is. Light but sturdy. The beaded adornments slide along the cord freely and with some work on your part, it might hang at its longest nicely.However, the cord is quite thin and disappointing and seems to be permanently curled from packaging and shipping position. No matter what I do, I cannot seem to straighten the cord so it hangs evenly. There are several twists and curls in it that make it look dumb. Although it is adjustable by a simple pull-the-knot-through-the-loop closesure, it doesn't stay where you put it. The slightest movement and it drops back to its longest.This would be much nicer on a chain that hangs appropriately. However, the openings in the adornment beads is so small, I doubt purchasing a separate chain would work. While the chain might fit through the beading and the bail for the medallion itself, I have yet to figure out how to get the loop at the beginning of the chain (that the lock attaches to) through the beads to begin the threading process. Don't think there is a chain out there small enough to fit yet strong enough to hold. Now, if one wanted to remove the loop for the closure on a chain, thread the chain through the beads and medallion and then reattach the closure loop, I am sure that would work. I just don't want to go through all that work. This is going back.p.s. I also purchased, at the same time, the Wolf Tooth necklace. Same holds true for that one. And in the picture online, the wolf's head appears to have varied colors on it distinguishing it from the 'tooth'. However, mine is all the same color so, once again, unless one looks closely, it is difficult to determine what the medallion actually is. The cord is the same as above. This one is also going back.The Wolf Earrings, on the other hand, while small, are great. Sturdy post that doesn't seem as if it will bend easily. These are very small so look best as a second piercing adornment, but can be worn alone for a more subdued look.The Wolf Cuff bracelet is nice, and looks much sturdier than it is. The first time I put it on and tried to gently bend the sides to fit my wrist better as one must do with most cuffs, the section where the wolf is attached got 'bend marks' in it. So now the cuff looks like a 3-sided box - actual bend marks showing top and both sides. I'll keep it because I bent it but doubt I'll wear it often.
",2
617,"I don't really like the quality of it. When you start to bend it around your wrist you can hear it almost crackling. I'm guessing this is because its Pewter which I'm not familiar with but I'm sure I wont purchase anything Pewter again. It looks like it would be a nice weight and feel but it just feels thin and brittle, when you bend it you can sort of see it get bubbled cracks(thats the best way I can describe it). I thought from the previous reviews that I would like it.. But I don't. It's a 50/50 product I guess. All in all, I'm dissapointed and I know I won't be wearing it anytime soon.
",2
618,"The look of the bracelet was exactly like the picture. It looked great on my wrist and for a month of wearing maybe 3 times a week. it broke. The metal broke right at the tail of the wolf. Maybe it is a weak spot at the wield, but I was shocked that it broke so easily. I liked the look and feel, but duribility is a big question. I would not buy this item again.
",2
630,"This is a nice ring. I thought it very pretty when I first received it. Over time it seems to have faded in color and I no longer wear it.
",2
688,"This charm is small and beautiful ... the hook on the charm broke after 1 week ... considering the price I was shocked at the small size and the fact that it broke so quickly ... BUT I will not return this product because I do love it despite the downfalls
",2
699,"Cute and cheap - you get what you pay for but only for a week. Because that's how long it takes before the stone falls out of the stud. You probably won't notice at first that you're walking around wearing 1 earring that looks like you found it in a dumpster. Not impressed, but I've accepted it and moved on. Clearly.
",2
705,"when this arrived, I was really disappointed. In the box it looks really cheap. However, it does look nice when it is worn. The clasp is a bit flimsy, and the shipping costs are outrageous. I would recommend you price shop a bit.
",2
713,"I got this for my wife at Christmas. We then had to travel across country from SC to WA. During the trip she kept some of her jewelry in this case. You know, the stuff she wears all the time. Well I spent hours untangling all her necklaces. They slip into the top of the case and are held in place by a little hook. The other end is free to move around. Presto! tangled necklaces. There is no way to hold the bottoms in place and if the case turns upside down (which happens when your moving luggage) the necklace slips off the top clip. Very disappointed.
",2
718,"Jewish star was purchased for my adult son. Although it is attractive, it is much too flimsy for a man to wear. I was very disappointed with the weight of the star, also. It appear in the picture to be a more substantial piece of jewelry.
",2
732,"I was embarrassed to give this to my stepmother for Christmas. I didn't realize it was embossed ""MADE IN CHINA"" on the bottom. I was very disappointed; it's a deal-breaking blemish on an otherwise nice piece.
",2
739,"I GAVE 2 STARS BECAUSE I BOUGHT THIS FOR AN ADULT CHARM BRACELET AND THIS IS TINY LIKE FOR A CHILD CHARM... IT IS VERY CUTE AND WELL MADE, SHINEY, AND THE COLOR IS A SOFT PINK (CUTE)
",2
753,"This is more of a charm than a keychain... If that's what you're looking for, buy away! However, the side of the shamrock that isn't shown has a relatively big stamp (not a sticker that can be removed) in the metal that says ""CHINA."" Not quite the Irish spirit I was looking for.
",2
757,"This charm has a goldish tint to it that made me think maybe it wasn't authentically sterling, but it was stamped with 925, as well as a GIANT ""China"" imprint. Not very pleased with the color or the stamp.
",2
760,"This item is awful! they have stamped the word China and a number into the face of the clover. who wants that?!
",2
761,"I expected this charm to be much bigger and didn't think to check the measurements when it popped up as my search for a &#34;four leaf clover key chain.&#34; It is EXTREMELY small. about the size of my finger nail. So if that is what you are looking for than this is the purchase for you. If you were looking for a key chain as I was don't waste your money. It barely fits on my key ring.
",2
763,"My biggest problem with this product is actually my fault. I searched for &#34;four leaf clover keychain&#34;, and this was the first item on the list. I did not read the entire name of the item which ends in &#34;charm&#34; or the description. The picture gave me no size reference so it actually looked like a keychain. And of course it was exactly what I was looking for in a keychain, sooo... I bought it! Needless to say I was very disappointed when I received it, and it was no bigger than an eraser head! So I just want to make sure everyone understands its a charm for a charm bracelet and not a keychain!Besides this minor complaint, I gave it only two stars because if I were purchasing a charm for my sister or girlfriend, then I still would have been disappointed! Like I said earlier, it's about the size of an eraser head which is small even for a charm. But also, on the backside it's got the word &#34;CHINA&#34; written across one of the leaves! And on another leaf it has a sterling silver marking. When I get a charm for my loved ones I, nor they want it to say anything besides what it's supposed to say!

777,"Bought these for my 9 year old niece for christmas and was slightly disappointed in them. They are really small. You have to have tiny ears to be able to notice that you even have them on. So, I'd only recommend them for toddlers and younger children pre-school who have pierced ears. Quality is decent sterling silver, and they are probably ok for moms to put on their toddlers because they will stay nicely due to the good screw backing. But,kids a little older who usually put their own earrings in might be disappointed and will probably have trouble putting them in themselves. They are so tiny (looks like about 1/4"") it's difficult to hold them to put them in and they will also be lost easily. Probably good for a small child who won't want to change their earrings very often and maybe keep them in, or if mom can do it for her. They might also be good for anyone with multiple piercings who want a few tiny earrings to go with their central earring.

781,"I was disappointed in these earring. They were very small and not very detail. It was not a good purchase

833,"I bought this necklace for my granddaughter. When I received it, I took it out of the box and it had two knots in it. I worked for a while and was able to remove one. Kept having a problem with new knots. Finally gave up and returned product. The necklace was nice enough but the chain is much too delicate for a child.

843,"I was not aware how tiny this charm was so I was disappointed. I am not sure my 4 year old niece will know they are slippers.

856,"This item was a disappointment because it was much smaller and lighter than I expected. For the price I expected a more substantial chain and pendant....had it been priced appropriately, about 50% less, I would've expected what I got and would've avoided it as a gift.
",2
867,"This is a necklace with 3 very tiny pendants, that is not connected to each other. They sort of just clump up and usually you just see the middle in front, blocking the rest.. The pink is not has red as in the pictures, it is more of a very light pink. Only reason I gave it an extra star is because the chain is fairly sturdy.

889,"These cuff links are pretty and are good in quality but a bit too big.

1089,"I think I waited about 3 weeks to get this necklace, and I was excited when I received it. However, on the 2nd day of wearing it, the chain broke, so now I have to purchase a new chain for it. The pendant is too heavy for the chain, so I suggest for amazon to upgrade the chain or stop selling this item with a wimpy chain.

1092,"The wishbone pendant is what I thought it would be, but the clasp on the chain is so tiny I can't get it to work. So now I just wish I could wear my wishbone, but I can't.

1113,"The pendant is lovely. Just the right size and very lightweight. However, after wearing it for less than a day, the chain broke. It wasn't even caught on anything, it just snapped on its own. I suppose I shouldn't have expected much for such a cheap necklace, but I was still disappointed that it didn't even last a full day.

1179,"This is a real nice bracelet, the problem is where the shiny part meet the matte part. The line seperating the the two is very rough, some parts that should be matte is shiny & some parts that should be shiny is matte. For a bracelet to list for a price of 400.00 should have showed better Quality & Craftsmanship. I should have returned this item, but I dont have the time nor the patience. I notified Netaya by email about the problem, but I got no reply.

1269,"I personally used the tape and the e-water lotion together and the combination effectively subdue my neck-shoulder ache which I have for many years. I applied the lotion daily after bath at night and replace the tape every 2-3 days. I am convinced with the technology that I decided to try their jewellery products since having the tape seen on body is not a pretty sight to public eye. Before I make any haste/impulse purchase, I googled for the product reviews and realised it is a mixed reviews - ~50:50 positive and negative. As I am convinced with what I have experienced with the tape and lotion effect, so I decided to trust my gut feeling to get the bracelet. I take it as the 50% negative reviews could be because the users do not have any pain/aches to begin with so they do not experience any ""miracle"". For example, if you have a flawless skin to begin with, you will not expect any miracle effect even if you apply La-mer/SKII/Lancome/Estee Lauder expensive skincare product daily. That's the logic. I seriously ALMOST buy this product until I turned over the package and saw this: Made in PXXXXXXXXXS (not Japan!). Instantaneously, I put back the item on the shelf and re-purchased the tape and lotion (both are made in Japan) instead. Now I know why the split review on the bracelets because the manufacturing source is different - this is my gut feel by the way. I rather tape around my body inconspiciously to mimick the jewellery claimed effect than buying the actual jewellery where the quality is questionable by my gut-feeling and so not comfortable in buying at all.

1281,"We have several Phitens - all of which are in the blue or black family. My daughter wanted an orange one, since her team colors are orange and white. In the photo, this looks like it is truly orange - and bright! The reality is that it's not. It's a very dingy color, nearly brownish, and it almost looks as though it's gone through mud and then someone attempted to wash it. Suffice it to say, I bought it for her for xmas, and she hasn't worn it yet. I'm thinking it will stay on her bureau. It's too bad.
",2
1288,"this is a piece of crap i ordered my about 2 weeks ago and the only good thing about it was that it came about 2 days early which was good but the necklace broke the second day i got it.

1290,"Yeah, so I was suckered into buying this product after seeing Josh ""LIAR"" Beckett wearing this during one of his pitching outings. Lemme just say THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP!!! No way does this thing relieve anything. I think its all in your head because when I first bought it I too believed it was working. But now MY BACK HURTS!!!! LIARS!!!! ARGH!!!PS Josh Beckett is currently injured...On the other hand, it does look nifty so if youre just buying it for the look then go for it. If not, go to an asian massage parlor or something.

1344,"I should have known that 72 diamonds spread out across a 1 carat total-weight piece would mean that each diamond was 1/72 of a carat, but it didn't occur to me when I ordered this for my lady. Anyway, it showed up today and it's absurdly tiny. The metal-to-stone ratio is about 200 to 1, no exaggeration. The craftsmanship on the links is decent, it definitely meets the description as posted, but, again, there's nothing to the 'diamond' aspect of this besides a little more shine than a normal link bracelet.If you think you're going to be a baller buying this for your girl, take her out for dinner this year and save your money to get her something nicer later. The pictures of the bracelet are accurate, but the camera they use is super-human in terms of zoom & focus. I can't hold the bracelet close enough to my face to make it look that big. The surface of each link that holds the diamond is no taller than 3mm, and the diamond is pronged __inside__ each link. To give a relative impression of how small this is, I could stack 7 or 8 links wide across my thumbnail, and, again, the diamonds are inside the links (hence much smaller).I hope Mommy likes it. Otherwise, I think I'll get her a non-jewelry gift. I might get this appraised for fun, just to see if it even approaches what I paid.

1377,"I liked this the least of the series. Generally, I think these little music boxes and most charming and whimsical.

1383,"It works like a music box--when you open it, the music sounds. But it only runs for several minutes and there seems to be a battery failure, but I cannot find the openging for battery replacement, so my daughter just use it as a ""jewelry box"".
",2
1386,"My children have had these jewelry boxes for about 2 years. The ballerina broke within the first year. I am shopping for new ones right now, and thought I would let others know in case you are considering these. They might be OK for older children - but my kids were about 4 and 2 when they received these.
",2
1405,"I didn't think about it when I purchased it - I liked all that I saw. But I don't like the image on the top of the box - it isn't flowers like the side - it's a ballerina. The inside is pretty, but the box looks a lot cheaper in reality. Poor quality construction. Not really bad for the price compared to other boxes online, but not what I would consider a great find. I'll be watching for a different box while I shop in person after this experience.
",2
1411,"Could have been the cutest gift, but was not.The mirror is not shaped as a heart. First problem.The music is fantastic and in the end we bought it for that specific tune. First good point.After less than 2 weeks of DD (age 6) opening it, the poor ballerina sprung into action (literally) and this caused the poor ballerina to fall apart: the belly separated from the tutu, the tutu separated from the legs and the legs came off the little spring that triggers the dance.We tried to fix it once, and it worked.Unfortunately once it breaks, it will bvreak again. And it did. And when we tried to put it all back together we ended up pushing out one tiny screw that triggered the music.Not a success story.But DD loved it while it lasted.
",2
1417,"I bought this for an 8 year old - while she was delighted - I was dismayed. Ballerna is on a spring to pop up when lid is open. I doubt it will last long because of the spring

1424,"The picture reflects a warm, coffee bean brown color for the jasper. I understand that natural stones vary a great deal in color, but the jasper (the largest stone) in my earrings was the color of oatmeal, with a few dark brown flecks. I can wear them with beige clothing, but they are not what I expected, based on the picture.

1438,"The music box was nice and it works, but the nativity looks cheap. I gave these as gifts and I was embarrassed because it looked like I bought it from the Dollar Store for $5.

1466,"I wore this anklet twice and then it was gone. I believe it broke at one of the hearts, the anklet is a white gold heart and then gold chain, then heart etc and I think the anklet has a weak point where the white heart is attached to the chain. So it was gone and I was very disappointed. Although it was a beautiful anklet and I was happy in the beginning, I don't think the way it is put together is very strong. I'm sad.
",2
1556,"The chain was too short to slide through my large head. I opened up one of the chain links to disconnect the chain and reconnect the chain before I could wear it. Few inch or two extra chain length would have earned higher star reviews.

1588,"After my first wear, the top ball split. I don't believe I over tightened it, especially since I was aware of the tenancy for the acrylic balls to split over a metal thread. I still gave it two stars because I have purchased other rings from this company with the same materials and had no problems.

1683,"This necklace was not Italian as indicated. It did not come in a wooden gift box. It was lighter in weight than listed. It did not have a smooth and polished surface. It was generally poor quality. I returned it immediately but have yet to receive my refund two weeks later.

1692,"Bracelet looked great at first, and for the most part still does EXCEPT the clasp. The clasp has been changing color since about a month after I purchased it.

1804,"I bought the ring because I had seen pictures in magazines that the bar will flip over and follow the curve of your belly as you grow. I started wearing it at month 6. It never flipped and I ended up taking it out in month 8. However, it was a little bit helpful in that the gauge was smaller so I could stretch a little more and didn't end up losing the hole. Now I'm back to my regular rings and they're fine. For 7 bucks, you might as well but it's nothing glamorous.

1808,"The good:It arrived on timeIt's functionalThe bad:The ends were very tricky to screw on. I ended up having to use scissors to ship away at the bar in order to get the ends on. High maintenance!Also, the ends are really bulky and a very lumpy under clothing. No reason to have them that large.But - this is a hard item to find, so I at least appreciate that I have what I needed.Hope this helps.

1817,"This ring was not as expected. The color of the Amethyst is light green, almost translucent and it does not have the two-tone color effect as shown in the picture. I have had this ring for about 6 months, only wearing it 3 times and the stone has fallen out. Beautiful picture but ring is not up to par.
",2
1831,"I also ordered these earrings, expecting them to be pink like the pair in the picture. Although they are well made, they are white; no hint of pink can be found. These earrings are nice if the color doesn't matter to you , but don't expect them to look like the pair shown.
",2
1838,"I found these earrings to be bigger, heavier, and of lower quality materials than I expected. The stones are nice, but the setting seems cheap/fake looking. I haven't worn them much at all sadly.
",2
1855,"I'm not ordering anything that has missing parts!
",2
1859,"I purchased this item thinking that it would be similar to the picture on the site. I was a little disappointed in that the bracelet links are larger then they actually appear in the photo. The bracelet is still very nice looking but, again, larger than I had assumed it would be.The clasp is very hard to fasten and unfasten. Once the bracelet is fastened it stays fastened, literally. My problem is that when I put it on I have a HARD time getting it off. I'm sure that with some wearing the clasp will get easier. I just hope, after reading another review, that it will not get so easy that I end up losing it.
",2
1894,"Do not be impressed by the photo of the pendant. In reality, it looks cheap. Worth 10 dollars, not a penny more. :(

1914,"Received this item promptly. I would not order it again if I were to have the opportunity to do it over. It is not what I thought it was. The sale went fine just not satisfied with the item itself.
",2
2005,"Not happy with this ring. Looks nothing like the picture. The stone looks fake and the band is thin, very lightweight, just flimsy!Would send back but my husband opened it and threw all packing away.
",2
2029,"Granted I only spent $22 on this ring and so maybe I should not have had high expectations, but I did expect it to last more than one week of normal usage. The prongs of the setting kept catching on clothing, and they bent almost immediately, the stone became loose and then while I was trying to bend a prong back to secure the stone, the prong broke completely off. The prongs on my ring were not nearly so smooth looking as the photos show. It was a very pretty ring, but unfortunately, not made to last.
",2
2052,"BE CAREFUL!!!!! This medal is hollow and SOUNDS hollow when it moves around on a necklace. I had no idea it was going to be hollow and almose puffy looking. Because it's a good looking medal, I still gave it as the gift I intended it to be, but I was a little embarrased. I will probably replace with another, medal that doesn't ""sound"" so cheap when worn...
",2
2100,"The item exterior covering is low quality. It was made in Taiwan back when Taiwan still was ""Made in China"" so this item, while new, feels like it has been sitting in a warehouse for a generation. You can search around Amazon and find a superior product for about $17.
",2
2114,"The stones on this bracelet are extremely pale, more pink than purple. I ended up returning the bracelet because I have amethyst jewelry and it was extremely poor quality.
",2
2116,"I received the package quickly and was initially satisfied with the product- until I tried wearing said chain... the tiny clasp is extremely awkward to use- VERY difficult to put together... and to top it off it just broke. DO NOT purchase this it is cheap!
",2
2147,"I bought this bracelet for $50, and now it's a lot less, hmmm... I like the pearls, but the bracelet is very short and stiff, maybe too tightly knotted, so that I can not put it on myself. The fact that the clasp is kind of awkward doesn't help. I can not recommend this item and I would not buy it again.
",2
2157,"The pearls themselves seem to be of decent quality but the strand seems too short, its like a choker and the pearls do not lay straight. Worth the $35 but not a huge bargain for a higher quality piece.
",2
2161,"This necklace seems to have two personalities. Reviewers on one hand showered praise on it, and on the other disparaged it. Well, I gave it a try, and, sorry to say, I did not like it. Perhaps the quality of the newer ones are not up to par, because it seems the older reviews are better. In my case, I agree with one of the recent reviewer that the necklace is too tight that is why it does not straighten up. Also, a majority of the pearls are too small closer to the 3.0 size than the 7.5mm size. However, the pearls themselves seem to have a nicer quality. I returned mine.
",2
2174,"When I recieved the item, the only problem with it was a slightly bent clasp. Because of the bargain, I overlooked this relatively small matter. I thouroughly enjoyed my pearl bracelet for just over three months, wearing it almost daily. Then the strand broke near the clasp. Thankfully, I only lost one pearl, however I am very disappointed that it broke at all. Unfortunately, there is not a return, exchange, or repair policy for this item, that is viewable through this site.
",2
2185,"Ring is way too small and looks like a toy when putting it on. I would not recommend if you want a nice 1/2 carat ring.
",2
2214,"The quality of the pearls looked fine. However, the stringing was not good and the pearls would not lay flat.
",2
2234,"I bought this item for my wife, I just recieved it now and with great anticipation opened the box only to be shocked by its tiny size. the picture posted by amazon is really really REALLY enlarged. this thing is no bigger then a pair of rice grain stuck together. dissapointed.
",2
2252,"The product was beautiful! But the post came unscrewed during the first night I slept in them and I now only have one earring.... $40 down the drain.
",2
2256,"The dangles are poorly made and are very stiff. while trying to adjust, one of the stones fell out. Super glued it back in and still wore them. They look nice though. (I had a matching necklace)
",2
2326,"The ring felt a little thinner than expected, but aside from that it's a nice looking ring. The problem is that it fit much smaller than the size listed. I am able to wear it but not on the finger I wanted because it's too small.
",2
2330,"Buyer beware. Take your left or right hand. Now look at your pinky finger. Go to the tip of your pinky finger. Depending on the size of your hand, the tip of your pinky might be larger than this ""Italian charm."" No charm here. I am not moved.

2334,"I tried this ring on my wedding ring band finger and it would slip and slide around my finger, so I know that I must need an 8.5 size ring for my wedding ring band finger. I was disappointed that it didn't fit but I am getting another one that is a 3-Stone ring that is a size 8.5 and it represents more to me about my wedding day and process than just the one solitary stone.
",2
2363,"I bought these for a cartilidge piercing. I like small earrings, but these were almost too small to get in my ear. After 20 minutes, I finally got them in, but I could not close them. This was about 5 days ago and I still have not been able to close the darn things. I have already lost one because it fell out. I would recommend a slightly larger earring with a HINGE clasp.
",2
2367,"I bought 2 pairs of these for my second and third lobe piercings to wear on a daily basis. They were the perfect size, however, they were surprisingly hard to put in. The clasp was incredibly hard to get into the hole in 2 of the earrings.I've had them for a little under a month now and the silver is turning brown/black on the inside of the hoop in all 4 earrings. You do get what you pay for, seeing as they were so inexpensive. These might be good if you plan on taking them out daily. I wouldn't buy them again.
",2
2369,"I received these earrings fro my teen daughter and they were very very small don't recommend them to any one.
",2
2370,"If I could go back and not buy these I would. I should have listened to the reviews because they're right! I bought 6 pairs of these for my ears and thought I could put them in my lobe piercings and the other pair in my cartilage. Well I was wrong. The earrings were really hard to get clipped in the back so it took me over an hour to get 4 pairs in and they didn't fit in my cartilage at all. They were however the size I wanted for my ear. Another thing I noticed, about a week of wearing them the part that goes into your ear started to change color to an almost black color. Next time I'll listen. A few earrings also un clipped and I almost lost them.
",2
2385,"I gave this product a low rating ONLY because the wire would not stay closed. I did like the earrings just not the fact that the ONE hoop wire would not stay closed. The seller did accept request for complete refund. At this time I am awaiting the refund to be credited. If need be, I will change this review to a higher 'star' rating.
",2
2387,"I have not purchased, but at 10 by 8 millimeters, the stone is smaller than what I'm looking for. Can anyone let me know where I can find a larger stone?
",2
2406,"These are really small and look like a craft project that my niece would make at school. I wouldn't recommend them.
",2
2436,"I know it's the nature of natural stones not to have consistent color, but I didn't like the way these earrings went from light at the top to dark at the bottom. If the bracelet can be made with matching stones, I would think they could make the earrings the same way.
",2
2450,"This is a nice set of earrings for a reasonable price. However, on the backside of the earrings, the words ""Made In Thailand"" are stamped in letters large enough to easily read. While the earrings will hang so as to conceal this gaudy stamp most of the time, it will become noticeable over the course of the day.This product could have been an exceptional buy, but the tasteless stamping on the back of the earring itself makes this reminiscent of a child's play jewelry.
",2
2451,"I got the earrings today and they don't look at all like in the picture in fact they look cheaper than what I paid for so disappointed
",2
2454,"I had these on my wish list for a long time and finally ordered them. In the picture they look much more substancial then they really are. They are super light and flimsy, and would be better for a small child, not an adult earring!
",2
2462,"Well, I purchased it for my wife thinking it was 2-shaded earrings[as looked in the picture]. However, it's plain sterling silver. It's bent from the middle that gives a shade in some conditions. Moreover, it's extremely thing and the doesn't worth the money!
",2
2477,"If you like this design, then go for it, because Peora has good quality pieces. However, after seeing this in person, I can tell you that the setting is too big and overpowering for the size of this gemstone, so it ends up looking a little weird. It might look better with a stone that has more brilliance than citrine (perhaps blue topaz?), but either way I'd look for a different setting.
",2
2497,"Read the measurements carefully...this is MUCH smaller than it appears, and not high quality. I've not been impressed with Amazon's jewelry in the slightest.
",2
2501,"The flowers on this bracelet are quite large - the picture doesn't accurately depict it. There is nothing dainty about this piece. I would NOT pay the full price listed on Amazon, and I don't feel it is worth the price I paid either ($49). The other thing I don't like about this bracelet is the large gap between the flowers, where the clasp attaches. There are needless links that create this space and make it quite unattractive.
",2
2514,"I ordered my jewelry cleaner directly from Shaper Image. The unit arrived a few days later, but they didn't ship the cleaning solution with it and it took another week for that to arrive. When I finally got everything I was so excited to use the cleaner expecting to get the orginial shine my engagement ring had when my husband gave it to me. I was disappointed. After 2 cleanings (one on normal mode and one on high) the cleaner got the platinum band shiny again and the top of the diamond. However my particular ring has a unique setting that is like a U shape that the diamond sits in. When you hold the ring up at eye level you can actually see the bottom of the diamond. The cleaner did not clean the area under the diamond at all. I can easily get into this area under the diamond with a small brush, it is an open space so I thought the solution wouldn't have any issues reaching this area. I was able to clean my ring better with the cheap ammonia based solution that you buy at a drugstore. This machine was a total waste of money for me.UPDATED: I have to admit I was too quick to judge this product. Apparently my ring was just extremely dirty, because it took about 6 cycles to get it completely clean. Now it does shine and sparkle again, and by keeping it maintained every 2 weeks it now stays that way. I do recommend this product, it just may take some patience in the beginning.
",2
2547,"It was smaller than I had expected, but it is a necklace that I will definitely wear in the future.
",2
2560,"I should have paid attention to the other review. These stones are very light almost pink. I loves the sapphire ones but am really disappointed in these. The diamonds are nice and for the price they are okay earrings. Since they are so inexpensive, I won't return them. After I pay shipping again, it's not worth it. But I won't buy from the company again.
",2
2611,"Steel? Is that what it is? It's design is nice, but it's about as flimsy as you can get! We were going to give it for a present after our son graduated from boot camp. After all the hard work he did, this would have been an insult to give him. We found another one that was much sturdier.
",2
2620,"Ordered these after ordering a pair of similar sized from smile river. These had much better color, a darker green that is fairly well represented in the picture. The clarity was poor (I don't expect diamond like clarity), so they really didn't sparkle. I'm guessing these could have benefited from a treatment of some sort. As Emeralds are in huge demand now, getting a good quality stone is very expensive. I talked to a guy at Halzberg Diamonds, and a set of 1/4 ct AAA stones was $1500+.
",2
2634,"This item is described as being "" 2"" Tall "". It is actually a tad under 1.5"". I e-mailed Sabrina Silver about my dissatisfaction with the deceptive description of the cross. They wrote me back that they didn't like my ""tone"" and that they were not going to apologize. They have however changed the description. Be advised though that the newly described height includes the loop on top of the cross.

2673,"Came un-hooked very easy. This item was longer than normal and I was unable to wear it.

2704,"The stones were smaller than appeared in the picture of them. Otherwise they are very nice.

2713,"I purchased these earrings to wear out to dinner a year ago but unfortunately have only worn them once. The first stone was much bigger than I expected, and instead of looking classy they look cheesy and fake.
",2
2729,"They were not as nice as I wanted them to be, I ended up returning them. I was expecting them to have more ""sparkle"", but they were pretty dull looking.
",2
2737,"This is the 2nd time I purchased from Eve's Addiction and I thought the jewelry was cheap for the amount I paid for it. Their photography is deceiving. I first purchased a bracelet for a present and was very disappointed when i received it. I returned it. I then purchased earrings and antoher pair for Christmas gifts and again, disappinted. One of the earrings looked like it had cut cz but when I received it it was just sterling silver with raised dots that appeared in the photo to be cz. I wouldn't buy from them again.

2750,"This is DAINTY, PETITE, TINY. It is a little girl or pre-teen ring! I am 5 foot 4 and 125 lbs and a size 6 and have very little fingers. This is small butterfly design wise AND size wise! I have about 150 size 6 rings THAT FIT FINE this one has to be a 5 and a half! If I were to wear it it would get stuck and an ambulance would have to come and paramedics would have to remove it from my swollen, purple finger. The butterfly IS exquisite don't get me wrong. Very pretty! Looks like real diamonds but it doesn't say the dimensions here in the description. It should be a half an inch at least to have any wow factor but it HAS TO BE SMALLER THAN THAT like a little girl's ring like I mentioned before. It has to go back and i am SO UPSET! This was my Mother's Day gift! I had e-mailed these people ASKING is it ran small too! They had no clue! The picture of the ring on the finger of the manequin or whatever it is is VERY deceiving. If any of my children were older I would give it to them but I don't know one single person small enough to wear this ITTY BITTY TEENY WEENY RING! SHOCKINGLY SMALL! I MIGHT exchange for a bigger size we'll see. It came really fast. All the stones are there. Good workmanship. The design is nice. It isn't all bad. I am just mad I can't wear it and nobody would notice it anyway I am thinking, as microscopic as it is! If you are 5 foot and under 100lbs go for it!
",2
2762,"The ring turns your finger green which is quite embarrasing. The cz is loose in its setting and actually makes a small rattling noise. I tried never to get any water on the ring and it still looks dull and has lost it's sparkle after only two months. I know it was less than $50 but I have purchased other cz rings that hold sparkle and shine for years. This set should be priced at around $20

2869,"I purchased these rings, to go with my gold rings, (to help make my gold rings, ""pop"" a little more with the white metal, without spending a fortune). I purchased them, to wear only two of them, on either side, of my real anniversary ring, and engagement ring. However, the stones are set in a way, that they dig into the fingers, next to the ring. Even when worn, with another two bands, (to help take the ""pressure"" off of the new bands), they still dug into my fingers, on both sides. I also found the rings, to be a bit larger, than a true size five. Don't get me wrong, they were pretty, very pretty. However, they were not worth being THAT uncomfortable.
",2
2895,"It sparkles and looks nice. I absolutely LOVE thicker bands so when I saw this, I had to try it. I loved having the option to wear all 3 or just 1. I wore it for a week then decided this had to go back. As much as I liked this, it was just too uncomfortable. The prongs stick out a lot and goes all the way around. It pokes the sides of the fingers next to it. I tried to deal with the discomfort but by the 5th or 6th day, I was soo ready to return it. Maybe this will work for someone who had really thin fingers but it was just too uncomfortable for me.

2914,"I was looking for a replacement wedding band, not too expensive because I recently lost my real wedding band (so sad)! This ring is far from ""real"" looking. Its very sparkly but its just something about it, that looks unreal...hard to explain. I hate to return things, but I am returning this ring. This ring is good to compliment other costume type jewelry, but will never pass for ""real"".
",2
2930,"I returned these rings after wearing them for one full day. They look pretty, but have sharp poking edges all around the sides from the stones and their settings. Washing and drying my hands was so uncomfortable because of the rough feeling these rings had. I actually had 2 cuts on my middle finger from where it had pressed against the rings on my ring finger. I was disappointed, but had to return them. Its just not worth the pain!
",2
2931,"I was looking for a costume set to go on either side of my engagement ring. After reading the reviews on these rings, I thought they might work. I was wrong. They are clearly costume when worn next to quality jewelry. They are also not all the same size. One of the bands was a bit wider than the others. All in all, I wasn't impressed enough to keep them to wear casually on their own. These were repackaged, and returned. Good luck ladies!

3044,"I have just received this ring today and upon opening its package my first thought was: ""Is this a joke? Did they send me the wrong ring??""Take a close look at the picture and what do you see? You see a very, very heavy looking ring that looks like it can take a beating. What do you get when you actually get this ring? You get a thin little band that is slightly less then 7mm wide. 7 millimeter = 0.7 centimeters!! How do I know this so easily? Because I have rings that are 7mm wide and this is not even that wide in comparison! So thats right! You get a ring that is less than 1 CENTIMETER WIDE!My advice, look elsewhere for a ring. This thing is so frail that I could snap it between two fingers. I have had this ring in my wishlist for almost 2 years now and when I finally break down and order it, I find out that it looks absolutely nothing like the picture advertises. Talk about severe disappointment. Old Glory, you have lost a customer today with me.

The other big negative I have with this product is that the necklace is not coated with any sort of material.

3188,"I bought this on sale as a fun piece to wear because I love dragonflies.Based on the reviews, I though this pendant would fit the bill. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and found that the stones were extremely cloudy.Cloudy to the point where there was no sparkle whatsoever. There was more sparkle from the dragonfly itself than from the CZ's. I know it's an inexpensive piece of jewelry, but I expected more based on the reviews.I do however, agree with the other reviewers that the dragonfly itself is a very nice piece, but the cloudy stones render it unwearable. The quality of the dragonfly is why I gave this necklace two stars instead of one.I ended up giving to my young daughter to wear as she liked it.

3221,"I bought this ring along with another smoky quartz ring from the same vendor. This ring fit nicely, but the large stone was chipped, scratched and had numerous bubbles in it. The silver is 'heavy' looking, not delicate. The other ring had to go back because it was simply HUGE, and I didn't want something that big, but it was in excellent condition. It sat a good half an inch above the top of my finger and the stone was as wide. This ring was also big, but not overly so. Neither appeared like good quality rings but then for these prices, you can't really expect top quality.

3223,"I was disappointed in the color of the 6 small garnet stones surrounding the large center stone. The small garnets are very light in color, like a blush. I am having my local jeweler replace them with fire garnets to match the center stone. Had I known of the color variation, I would not have purchased this ring. The photo on the internet does not represent the true color of the garnets.

3226,"I bought this for taking the ""good jewelry"" with me when I travel, but it really lacks usable features. I found it too small to be practical.The ring bar is so skinny that your rings end up rubbing together. It does have a couple of small pockets in which you could put rings or small earrings, and two medium-sized zipper pockets that might hold a bracelet or small watch.If you really want to take your good stuff with you, look elsewhere. If you just want to bring a spare ring and a pair of earrings for a weekend, this would be okay.

",2
3249,"Small cheap and not very shiny. Made in china. Definitely returning this one, it is of subpar quality. Looks like a necklace from one of those 50 cent machines.
",2
3310,"Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings.In my case, I bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee. When I first received it today, I was really liked the ""design"" of the earring. But after closer examination, I noticed that the ""blue"" stone was ""very light blue"". Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your ""own"" eyes and not through fancy ""photoshop"" website with touchup/enhanced photos.
",2
3322,"I bought a size 8 and could not wear the ring on any finger. It's very small and will need to be returned. Would suggest buying a size bigger than you normally wear.The silver bands with the CZ stones are not very clear, almost white and it throws off the attractiveness of the whole ring. The Marcasite stones are very beautiful and would have balanced better with a truer silver.
",2
3343,"Initially it is pretty, but for the price it isn't very much. Looks and feels like it would break in a few months. The thing is itchy against your fingers. You can't really tell the black is there. The picture is, in this case, alot 'prettier' than the actual thing.
",2
3346,"I love Sterling Silver & so I thought this would be a classy-looking piece. However, the crystals were very dull & the fit of the ring runs Very small. I wore it once uncomfortably, & was frustrated because I don't give away items that I myself don't like, so it was a waste of $$.
",2
3347,"This ring is INDEED MUCH NICER looking in the photo, it's very thin, and not enough room on the finger. Amazon.com should be ashamed for false advertsing, or misleading people...I fault myself though, because I usually do the reviews first, but this time I fell in love with the way it looked, and just ordered it..I'm totally disappointed, and will NEVER buy another ring from amazon..
",2
3350,"I have been wearing the ring for about a month and have had many compliments about the ring. However, the crystals are coming out in several spots. I would not recommend buying this product due to the lack of quality.
",2
3352,"in person the ring looks fake and the size is very odd. One side is smaller then the other. So its hard to wear. I got a size 6 and it fits like a 5 on bottom and 6 on top.
",2
3354,"the ring looks very nice but the stones are not mounted very well. After wearing it for 3 months I lost several stones.
",2
3355,"I have had my ring for just over a month and was quite pleased with how it looked,however, I have just noticed there are already 2 stones missing and I am very disappointed.
",2
3360,"After a few months this ring started to break apart. The crystals are coming out of the little shells.
",2
3381,"I bought this neclace for my 9 yr old son and he loves it and for the price I love it.
",2
3408,"Paper peeling off. Looks better in the photo that it does when it arrives. Not durable at all. I returned it.
",2
3428,"Not what I was expecting. The tool on the back to wind it up broke in the first 2 weeks.
",2
3470,"I am looking for a small hoop earring with a locking closure -exactly like this product.Since I participate in different sports, some involving helmets, I have been desperatelysearching for a style that was comfortable (no posts sticking out the back)and secure (one that I couldn't lose) during sports; yet simple and elegant.I also wanted one I could leave in during a shower or sleep that wouldn'ttarnish (hence white or yellow gold) or fall out.I like a matte finish and don't really care for cheap diamonds. The styleI chose had diamonds that were so small, I thought they compromisedthe look to the point that it would have been much better without (I didn't see anyon their site without diamonds).The style: (because I'm a designer)- they had no style (I have ideas of hat I'd like to see).The hoop was too thin. In short, the only things I liked, were that they were goldand had a terrific closure.I think there is a potentially large market for ""Sports Jewelry"". Someone out there-are you listening?Communication & response from the company ""Coolstyles"" was terrific, even though I didn't like their product.They are very service oriented. If I liked their products better, I would not hestitate to deal with them again!
",2
3484,"The photo here is thicker than the actual item. IT's not as beautiful as I expected. Top of it, they charge for shipping as well. So, not so happy with this purchase.
",2
3525,"This was my second pair of earrings. The back became loose and I lost one of the earrings. I thought that I had done something wrong. I liked the size, price and they were white gold. So, I purchased another pair. After about 2 weeks of wearing the earrings. The back became loose and I lost another earring.My inexpensive earrings went from $25 to $50. I'm not buying another pair. I decided I'd save money buying a more expensive pair
",2
3539,"I quickly received this from the seller, I was disappointed in how small the chain is. Around my little 13 year old brothers neck it nearly chokes him. Also wanted to say the chain itself is made of some weird kind of metal feels very flimsy and not very durable despite its weight.Other than that only Pro is that it looks cool..
",2
3551,"The necklace broke the first time my husband took it off. It's entirely too short. I am doubly disappointed because when it arrived the first time, the &#34;diabetic&#34; inscription was missing; I returned it, and the item, as it was advertised, did make it back before Christmas.
",2
3555,"the id necklace chain has no clasp and it barely fit over my head if someone had a bigger head it would not fit at all also the diabetes stamp u cannot make it out
",2
3561,"This bracelet, although relatively inexpensive, is too cheaply made. The links from bracelet to chain are cheap and can be pulled off. The emblem comes off (as mine did) as it is just glued on. The word DIABETIC lightly engraved on the back is barely readable and in less than good lighting conditions may not be able to be read at all. Not recommended at any price.
",2
3651,"The stones in these earrings are a lot paler than shown in the picture. If the earrings had been accurately depicted, I would not have purchased them.
",2
3661,"Perhaps I was fooled by the picture when I shouldn't had been. The necklace wasn't exactly what I expecting. I wanted to attach a pendent on the necklace and give as gift but it just didn't work.
",2
3697,"I guess I doubted the review and figured why not take a chance for such a small amount of money. I wanted pink coral earrings to match a bracelet and figured if they were red they would match some jewelry with a bit of red coral. I don't think I could wear them because of the unequal lengths of the drop. You do get what you pay for.
",2
3719,"I ordered this for my wife. It doesn't really look like the pictures. When it arrived the chain was knotted; it was difficult to fix this so that she could wear it.
",2
3726,"Looks ok not that shiny did not live up to expectations. If you expect this necklace to be sparking then don't buy.
",2
3754,"I purchased this as a gift a month before giving it to the person. It was too big for wife's fingers. Contacted merchant, but they said it was past return period. Will not buy from again. Gave two stars because it was as described.
",2
3778,"The ring itself is beautiful. But after about 4 months of wear the band started changing colors. I type at a computer all day so my hands arent in hard chemicals and I dont wear it in the shower. For the money I spent on this ring I was not that impressed that it started changing colors so quickly. Won't be buying another ring from this company anytime soon!
",2
3789,"In person, the earrings look kind of like sperm, and they don't hang nicely. They twist, so the faces are in back. Also, they are on the heavier side and are uncomfortable for people with sensitive ears. I'm thinking of reworking them into a necklace or something.
",2
3799,"The Product looks great, and fits and fall on my wrist perfectly. The Huge problem this item has is that the clip to lock it comes off so easily. The first time I wore it, it came off twice that night. Luckily I found it on the floor; so I put it on my pockets for the rest of the night. Since I like the look and it falls great on my wrist. Now I have to use a small band aid to secure it. I don't recommended for that reason.
",2
3816,"This necklace was not a bad purchase. Once I received it, I was not crazy about it. The chain had a large not in it when it arrived (4 weeks after I ordered it). I would not purchase this item again.
",2
3818,"Though the design is cool, the quality of this earrings set is poor. They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper. I also bought the pendant with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both. :-(I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design.
",2
3820,"Be aware, these are actually fairly heavy earrings. I find I can't wear them often without discomfort.
",2
3857,"Cute at first but the silver started to peel off of mine and the maker does not respond to questions at the web site.
",2
3872,"I bought this ring a couple of months ago for everyday wear. At first it was great- cute, unique, etc. Then I noticed the latch getting snagged in EVERYTHING, from my clothes to blankets to my bag... After a while, the very poorly made latch became bent out of shape, and now does not close properly.The ring itself is made nicely enough, and is a very cute design. However, the latch is way too pliant and easily bent. The hook on the top will get caught on any stray thread. I would not recommend this ring for everyday use- maybe as a formal or costume piece to be worn every once in a while.
",2
3875,"I've wanted a poison ring for quite some time now and when I saw this one, well it was just perfect. However when it arrived, the garnet looked a little fake and the latch on the locket part wasn't very tight and the locket would sometimes open therefore dumping any contents I had inside. :(. So with that in mind, I really don't wear it as often as I would have liked to when I ordered it, but it is a beautiful ring to wear and it makes a great conversational piece.
",2
3924,"The photo in the ad is very misleading as to the size of the pendant and I found no where in the ad as to the size of the stone so I presumed that the size would be similar to what was pictured. The pendant is very small. The quality of the piece is otherwise good just very disappointed in the size.
",2
3927,"What a disappointment. The stones are really pink and the clasp often comes undone. Also, note the size...they are tiny.
",2
3928,"The earrings were very beautiful as they came out of the box. One was perfect, the other, all the garnets were losse in their settings and two even fell out. Not very happy with them.
",2
3943,"I was really disappointed... I bought these as a Christmas present for myself..haha I received these yesterday just in time to wear them to my office Christmas dinner/party. Got them out of the box, left one went on fine, but while putting in the right one, one of the stones fell out. Of course, as small as the stones are, took me forever to find it. Needless to say, I had to put my other earrings back on and put these back in the box :( As far as looks, I thought they were very beautiful, unfortunately I won't be able to wear them, first without fixing the one, and second without the fear that the other stones will ultimately fall out and be lost...oh well.
",2
3951,"The earings were nice enough when they arrived, however upon wearing them a couple of times I noticed that the earing did not 'catch' well on one of them. It opened several times when I was out. I was always checking them to make sure they were there. Last week while out on an errand, I came home and noticed that one of them was gone. It had opened up and fallen off while i was out. They need to make sure the clasps work better.
",2
3957,"The earrings are pretty. However, as an owner of numerous garnets of varying shades, I cannot stress enough that these will not be able to be worn with ANYTHING red. They are a very pale orange color. Maybe I got duds, but the description is completely inaccurate. They're a clear orange color. No red undertones or anything. I'm keeping them because they were $20 and it's not worth the hassle of returning them. I'm doubting whether they're actually garnets, but at this point I guess I just don't care.
",2
3972,"When I first opened the package and saw the ring I noticed the outside band was pretty thick. I have a spin ring and it's not as nearly as bulky. I think the design is pretty but I was also having a hard time spinning it. It isn't extremely true to size due to the thickness of the outside band but if you want a ring that is bulky and stands out then this is a good ring for you.
",2
3993,"I longed for these earrings for weeks, but was so disappointed when I got them. They are a nice color, but a little too large for my tastes and a bit too heavy. So sad...
",2
4038,"I picked these out months ago as a suggestion for my fiance. Online they look gorgeous, and maybe if I got a microscope they'd look as pretty in person. I had to put them in my second hole because they looked ridiculous in the first. My fiance's incredibly disappointed because they are non-returnable. For this price I didn't think they would be huge, but I thought they might be at least visibly discernable with the naked eye.
",2
4070,"Sorry, but I am not impressed by this Rembrandt fleur de lis charm. Yes, it is sterling, yes, it is a good size for a charm bracelet, but it is hollow-backed, and there is no excuse for this not being solid (at least flatbacked) for the price. It is going back. Keep looking, folks, fleur de lis charms are hard to find, at least solid ones or ones that are the same front to back (as in 3-D), even in New Orleans.
",2
4072,"The color of these in the photo show a nice bright blue but the actual sapphires I got were a dark grey-blue. I bought other sapphires before and know they can be slightly different color blue but these are some of the dullest looking I've bought.
",2
4085,"I did not expect much for the price, but was nevertheless disappointed.There were quite large visible inclusions (esp. in the main stone and in one of the side stones) which allowed only a few light reflections within the stones (large parts of the stones looked simply ""blind"").In addition, the gold ring was shaped uneven and asymmetrical.Maybe I just got a really bad one...I would not feel comfortable giving this ring to anyone, so I returned it (bought a smaller one with cleaner stones and a whole lot more sparkle).
",2
4095,"This ring is of OK quality. I find the sizes to run a little small. I probably wouldn't buy another of these.
",2
4096,"Bought these for myself since I like amethyst. They appear cheaply made and there is a loose stone on one of the earrings which I thankfully discovered before it was lost. Couldn't recommend them based on the poor craftmanship
",2
4097,"These were worn *one time* and a stone dropped out of one of the settings. They have two pronged settings in sterling silver, they just aren't pressed around the gems well, no overlap to hold the gems in place.The earrings themselves are pretty. The stones aren't well matched, but for the price I didn't expect them to be. They do have good clarity and the silver shines well. The snap closures on the hoops are well made and hold together tightly.Too bad the stones don't stay in the earrings. As it stands, it's a waste of money to buy them and risk having a ruined piece of jewelry after one or two wears.
",2
4108,"I found the earings too small as compared to the picture shown.
",2
4122,"In my opinion, the stone was not of a high quality and did not reflect light.
",2
4126,"when i first get this ring is looked great. Then the citrine started to fade.It now looks like clear glass with a little color. I was heart broken.I will send it back.
",2
4144,"I bought these for one simple reason: they were basic gold earrings that I could wear every day. Nothing fancy, nothing too big. While the earrings themselves are nicely colored and have an even shape, the post and backing leave a lot to be desired. They do not ""catch"" - the connection is loose and unreliable. The post and backing have come apart often. I do not wear them to bed (although I have many earrings where that isn't a problem) and I do not pull on them or put them under any stress. They just aren't made very well. My solution, if you experience this and if returning them is not an option for you, is to go out and buy a package of gold backing from a jewelry or accessories store. Those seem to work out OK.
",2
4167,"I have been wearing the pair as basic studs for 2 months (not continuously). The color on the back of one of the studs already turned from gold to brown. Normally 14K gold shouldn't do that. 10K gold would change color easily. Also I'm allergic to certain metal so have to wear only gold or silver. I'm not allergic to other 14k gold studs/earrings I have but with this one that had the color change, my ear feels pain/itchy like when I wear those cheap metal studs.
",2
4170,"i guess I didn't realize how small 5mm is. These are a good size for agirl, but a little small for a woman. I don't wear particularly largeearrings, but these are very small.
",2
4180,"These are very small at 5mm but the big problem is the earring backs are really really small and too hard to hold on to. I won't be wearing them much as they are hard to fasten.
",2
4182,"These earrings DID NOT have the friction backs. Ordered in March and lost one within a few weeks. Found it and lost it again. Did not fit tight and only had 1 little lip to catch the back with at the very end.
",2
4184,"This purchase was very disappointing. Yes, the gold ball is pretty, but it measures less than 4 mm! I did not want to spend the money returning them, so I wear them once and a while, but I am not happy about them at all. So much for trusting information on the internet. Next time I'll buy them in a store, so I can see what size they really are.
",2
4191,"It turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife's ears. I assume that the stems must not be white gold? Other than that they are as expected. Not perfect, but not bad for the price.
",2
4207,"I think these were made for children.... I gave these as a gift to my daughter - and they were to small for her lobes! I think they were mismarked in Amazon... She in turn gave them to a friends daughter...watch the labeling.
",2
4210,"Earrings arrived in good time BUT - watch out for the heavy duty and sticky tiny tape that they run through the opening of 1 of the earring backs. Finally got it off but the back got bent in the process. They're so tiny but tried to fix it. I thought I had and an hour later realized that the back had come off while wearing it. Lost forever. Had to use a spare that I already had. Other than that, these are your basic ball stud earrings. WHY did you have to put that tape there?
",2
4219,"These were the size I wanted and they were cute but the posts were very short. It almost seems that these were children's jewelry. Nor did the catches stay in place. I lost an earring within three days. As far as I an concerned, these are not worth purchasing due to the design of the earrings.
",2
4220,"Nice earrings if a bit larger and longer tip so that it goes through ear with room to spare so that it is easier to put on and so that the clip does not have to pushed into ear so that they stay. I had to take them off because it hurt.
",2
4263,"This chain has a beautiful color. I put it on. I turned to answer the phone, the chain caught on a button on my blouse, and fell to the ground. I had had it on for less than 2 minutes. So much for the quality. This chain is very weak - not for daily wear.
",2
4265,"I didn't like this item, it's much thinner than pictured. I'm sending mine back and I think it's overpriced.
",2
4351,"I am rather picky, but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage, but also the name. They were not what I was expecting when they arrived. They are okay, but not nearly what I thought they would be. They are not very sea opal-ish -- they look too glassy and transparent. The silver is also okay, but could be better. I would not recommend.
",2
4367,"These earrings look actually better in the pic than on your ears. The onyx is nice but they are rather flimsy because they are so light weight. I found much nicer Earrings made of onyx in JC Penney and the cost- well it was also betterI would not recommend this item. They are not worth the money.
",2
4410,"This order was placed as a gift for my mom, this year I was disabled from surgery and ordered 100% online. Well this was ordered in the 1st days of December. Everything else on that order (other merchants) were received within the week while I waited and waited for someone to contact me about this gift.It was not until Amazon emailed me and said this merchant had yet to confirm the order and was not responding to emails, then I emailed the owner of this company. I received no response until finally I stated that I was going to complain, within minutes I received an email from the owners Blackberry stating only that I would receive it by Christmas Day. When I responded to him again I got no answer.I emailed him again several times as the days got closer, it finally came on Christmas Eve and just as I was afraid would happen - it looked nothing like the picture and now I had no time to do anything about it.Also for the price it didnt even come with a chain (or even a simulation) just rubber banned to the little box.I didnt bother the seller even though I was upset feeling it was the Holidays and I am not in any way a nasty person.Then a week after Christmas I got an email that my item had been shipped - NOW I get an email?. This got me even more upset so I contacted the owner again, in a nice way explained and received a nasty email in return.I will never do business with this company again, will not be refering anyone either. I am sure they will be glad to hear this.(Although he was not good at responding to emails, somehow I am sure he will answer this review. I am telling you prospective customers, give yourself time if you order - just in case mine wasnt a one time experience). Good Luck.
",2
4419,"I was disappointed in the aring.. I thought it was going to show the crystal stones better. I would not get another one nor would I tell anyone to purchase this ring
",2
4437,"I thought the picture looked good, but I didn't like the ring very much once I saw it in person. It's also not very comfortable to wear.
",2
4470,"Pretty Smokey Quartz Gemstone Band .925 Sterling Silver RingThe setting prongs are high and catch on loose material. The sterling silver looks like it is sterling silver coated. Very high gloss, shallow depth. I know this is an inexpensive ring, but in person it looks even cheaper than that.
",2
4471,"I purchased this ring along with the same vendor's 'adorable garnet' ring. Both had to go back. The garnet ring was nice but the large stone was damaged in multiple spots. This ring was in excellent condition but it was just ridiculously big. The photo looks like a ring that could make a statement but not one that would be an anchor! It wasn't heavy, just cheap looking. You half expect to see mold lines up the sides of it. The prongs were also huge and unshapely. It's a shame because it could have been really lovely had the maker simply reduced the size and taken a little more time with the details.I am hesitant to buy from this vendor again.
",2
4497,"The ring purchased looked alright but the material seems to be of inferior quality as one week later, the ring broke into several pieces. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.Sharon
",2
4516,"Received this ring, unlike the picture shown here at amazon the ring was more of a rusty orange color and not at all like the deep red shown in this picture. Also the customer service from Gem Avenue is terrible!
",2
4525,"This is a low priced diamond ring, and you get what you pay for.The diamond itself is in a fairly raised setting, but the diamond is very shallow inside of the setting. Basically, it only looks good when you are viewing it from the top. From the sides you can see how little diamond there is.The diamond I received was quite yellow in tinge, I compared it to a $200 diamond ring that my sister owns. Also, it lacked much of the brilliance or sparkle that I saw in the other ring. The other diamond was also much larger, which already makes up for the price different.Even for the money I was disappointed in the quality because I felt like a cubic zirconia would have been much better, as this diamond did not stand out at all.
",2
4535,"I wanted a reasonably priced CZ princess stud earring that wouldn't turn my ear green. Eve's Addiction products are dependable and durable, but they were HUGE. I mean almost 2 carats each. They should really specify the size because i wouldn't of thought they would be so over-the-top big. So now they'll be costume jewelry or given away.
",2
4606,"I hate giving two stars to a religious item, but i bought 5 of these thinking I would give them to some of my grandkids. I wore one for a month, it started to wear where the cross touched my body. I am totally surprised and decided not to give them out. I recommend finding a solid gold cross, something with real value.
",2
4637,"The ring is really cute and it feels sturdy enough. But I ordered a size 8 so that I could wear it on my middle finger, and it barely fits my ring finger, (which means it is on the small side of a size 7). Maybe they just sent me the wrong size, (though the invoice says &#34;8&#34;), but if this is indeed what they consider an 8, then they have a faulty measuring tape!I'm going to keep it anyway, but I'm kind of disappointed.
",2
4674,"This charm looks pretty straight from the box, but that's about it. The day after I got it, the clasp broke and the ""abalone shell"" had a deep scratch in it, just from doing laundry. I would not recommend that anyone else buy this.
",2
4713,"The cross is very nice, but larger than expected. I'm looking for an extremely small cross. Beware the chain clasp. The ring end was bent (received that way) to fit through the bail on the back of the cross and wouldn't slide on the clasp end for security.
",2
4728,"I bought this chain for a pendant I made for my girlfriend. The clasp came apart from the jump ring the first night. Also, her hair keeps getting stuck in the links. This is a snake chain which should be very tightly linked. Altogether I found this to be pretty and shiny, but rather thin and flimsy, and the clasp is so tiny that it is hard for anyone to use unless they have very nimble fingers. I went to a local department store and purchased another one that was higher quality for the same price as this one. I will use this at another time after fixing it, because I don't want to pay return shipping.
",2
4731,"I like the look of this chain but had to return, it was yanking my hair out in chunks within 15 minutes of putting it on. Would never buy again.
",2
4733,"I was disappointed in this chain. I actually ordered two, one 18 inch and one 20 inch, but sent them both back. They were sturdy but the silver was almost unnaturally bright for sterling. It looked fake and did not match the sterling pendant I wanted to put on it. I almost kept them because of the awesome price just to see if they developed somewhat of a patina, but in the end decided to return them. Of course, with Amazon, returning was a breeze!
",2
4739,"This chain is beautiful and fit my pendant that I received for my anniversary but this chain grabs my hair. I can't feel any rough areas on it but it will grab and wind pieces of my hair around itself, maybe mine is defective? even though I don't see anything. I ended up using a different chain because I couldn't stand having my hair pulled all the time. My hair seems to wrap around near the clasp. This is OK for an occasional wear but I find it unacceptable for daily wear.
",2
4785,"I really liked it when I received it. However, after wearing it for a few days, the part of the chain that was closest to my neck discolored. I have never experienced that with other silver chains. I had diffulculty cleaning it with silver polish and that area is nowhere as shiny as the rest of the chain. I would not purchase this again.
",2
4805,"The length of the necklace is perfect. The clasp is fine. My objection is that it looks a lot more sturdy in the photo than it actually is. Very fine and wimpy looking chain. Will notn order from here again.
",2
4808,"The chain would have been nice but it arrived tarnished. Haven't decided if I will try to clean it or send it back
",2
4812,"I thought I ordered a longer chain and it's too short so I can't use it. I'm not sure how to return it.
",2
5046,"When I opened this I absolutely loved the charm, it was exactly what I was looking for. The chain was of very poor quality, thin and really flimsy. I decided to go ahead and wear it this week and get a new chain over the weekend. The chain broke on second wear and pendant was lost. It was very disappointing.
",2
5074,"I ordered this ring about three and a half months ago, and after wearing it nearly everyday, it recently broke literally in half (so now I have to ""C"" shaped pieces). I was taking it off, it fell on a hard surface from about two feet and cracked on the weld located directly opposite the snake ""head"" part. I was never excessively rough with the ring, so it had to be craftsmanship. Also noticed was that the silver plating had begun to come off rather quickly around the edges of the ring, and it turned black. The plating wearing off wasn't too bad looking but I was rather dissapionted when it broke in half in a situation were most rings would leave unscathed. I am giving it a two because it looks good and feels heavy, but is simply made to a standard not fit for everyday use. I would only recommend it to people looking to use it casually, once or twice a week. Otherwise, it will break, it is not a ring to wear everyday.

5088,"Simply said the ring fell apart after a month's time. Felt it was poor quality espcially after stones were lost.
",2
5091,"Regretfully, the first time I wore this ring was in December, which is beyond the return window. The first time I wore it, I looked down as I was leaving home & noticed there was a stone missing from the setting. The prongs on the ring were not pushed down very well on any of the settings. Once I noticed the missing stone, I adjusted all the other prongs.
",2
5108,"The color of the ring was not as pictured, hint of the palest blue. The sizing is a bit smaller than anticipated and it seems that the stone side is more flat instead of round. It probably would have been more flattering to have 5 stones and a more circular appearance.It still stacks and is not that bad for the price
",2
5153,"Received the item (ordered it for Christmas but it didnt ship till 1/12). When I finally got it, one of the black sections on the cross was missing. The customer service people were no help and gave me the impression I was interrupting their social life (Called twice to get another operator). I'm sending the item back today (had to pay for shipping, no UPS return label available). Overall, dissatisfied with the seller, west palm beach jewelry. Item was nice for the price but hard to read the lords prayer (looks like its there though).
",2
5177,"The tag attached to this ""Jumbo Rusty Chain"" says it is ""OVER 6 feet long"" but when I received them in the mail, they are not over six feet at all.... they aren't even close. I would say they are close to FOUR feet, if that. So beware if you are looking for a longer chain. If I were Buycostume (the Seller).... I would contact their Chinese suppliers and have them either lengthen the chain when they make them or change the tag attached to read correctly. Thanks.

5188,"I got my nose pierced back in May, and found out that I have a sensitivity to medal, so when I found out that plastic works for me I ordered this, I'm sure that other customer's found this product comfortable, but for me I did not it was extremely hard to get in, from the picture I didn't realize that the top was metal I thought it was all plastic with a jewel on top. I tried it anyways thinking that okay the plastic will be inside and metal on the outside and bam...my nose had a reaction. So for those who have a metal sensitivity this is not the nose ring for you.I hope this review is helpful for those that love the look of a nose piercing, but cant do metal.
",2
5195,"When the nose screw came I absolutely loved how it looked! However when I tried to put it in, the end of the plastic screw was very scratchy and painful (enough to make my nose start bleeding from the tiny scrapes it gave me). I couldn't even get it in vey far without getting scraped. When I looked closer I saw that there was some scratchy plastic poking up out of the end. I even tried filing it down but it didn't help. It is such a shame because I really liked the looks of the cone but I can never actually wear it. This was my first time getting a bioplast nose screw but I think in the future I will stick to metal screws.

5210,"The San Marco bracelet was very pretty and well made. However, I did return it because I thought the sapphire stones looked too black. In fact, the stones didn't look blue at all, even in bright sunlight.
",2
5270,"Looks pretty in the picture and when received, but it is stiff and was not possible to position it so it didn't look twisted when being worn. Maybe I received something defective? I returned it.
",2
5301,"Although the bracelet is embedded with glitter, the resin is a poor quality. It's a bit dull. Mine was very scatched when it arrived, and even has a small chip missing from the edge.
",2
5332,"These earrings are cute, but the sox both face the same direction. That means that the pair of sox on your left ear faces backwards. And there is no way to make them face forwards. The sox should have been cut out as opposites, rather than identical.
",2
5343,"This review is not about the product (I have not received it yet) but about the Amazon service itself.When saying I have not received it yet, I am not entirelly correct. I did received the box, with the jewelry box inside. The problem was that when I opened the jewelry box, there was nothing inside! That is correct, it was empty! My guess is someone in the wharehouses took it from the box before shipping it, but I will never know... The worst thing was that this was supposed to be a gift for my wife for Christmas.Now, the Amazon service was kind enough to try to re-send it as soon as they could, but it will not arrive before tommorrow, which is Dec. 27, way after Christmas! Hope THAT box will have something inside (don't hold my breath though). Arrrrrgh!
",2
5362,"The bracelet is okay. It isn't as shiny as the one pictured in the photo. I guess I got $5 worth. It did arrive in a reasonable amount of time.
",2
5383,"I bought this anklet to take on a beach vacation this winter. It arrived promptly and in new condition. It is a little too yellow for my usual taste of yellow gold (hopefully that makes sense to some). It looks quite nice, but is very thin - a great ankelt if you want to make a subtle statement. I only give it two stars because I started to wear it immediately and after only two or three days, I somehow managed to catch it on my shoe and when I went to pull my shoe off the anklet broke. I am not a very strong person, so it did not take much. I did not contact the seller because I do not see this as their fault. If you are looking for a subtle, delicate, yellow gold anklet I do recommend this, but only if worn with care and caution.
",2
5392,"The cross itself is very pretty, but unfortunately the hoop broke off just days after being worn for the first time. It didn't take much effort at all, I just accidentally dropped it on some grass and the hoop broke off, so now I have no way of wearing it. It's very cheaply made, but the design is very nice, and there's no denying that's a beautiful piece of jewelry. Buy at your own risk.
",2
5436,"This bracelet isn't what is shown in the picture. It is flat, and shinny, not as shown! You would think they could have used a better photo!

5466,"THE BRACELET IS VERY PRETTY, BUT IS NOT AS THICK AS PICTURED. ITS PIC MAKES IT LOOK STURDIER BUT IT IS ACTUALLY VERY DAINTY.
",2
5468,"When I got this item, the clasp on the pearl seemed like it was going to open and the pearl fall off. the chain seemed very flimsy. It took my about 10 minutes just to untagle the chain. The pearl itself was nice and that is why i gave it 2 stars not 1. I returned it cuz it wasnt worth it.
",2
5470,"I THOUGHT THEY HAD SENT ME THE WRONG BRACELET-THE LEATHER WAS A DIFFERENT COLOR AND TEXTURE FROM ONLINE PICTURE AND THE PEARLS ARE SOOOO SMALL-THE WHOLE THING LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE FOR A 6 YR. OLD.I'M SO DISSAPOINTED.IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
",2
5485,"After a few weeks of wear, it turned colors. The yellow part turned a brownish color. Disgusting!!! Needless to say I got about 3 weeks use out of it!
",2
5526,"I was looking forward to wearing this necklace but it came as a disappointment. It is simply cheap material and cheaply made.
",2
5553,"I purchased this ring as a surprise for my wife when I thought it would look perfect in a set next to her more expensive engagement ring. On Wednesday, she got home before I did thanks to UPS; the Cat was out of the bag! She liked the ring so much; she had it on when I got home. The following morning, wife calls and tells me when she got to work that one of the 5 tiny stones was missing. Sure enough, upon close inspection, I was rather surprised by flawed design of defective support structure inadequate hold the stones in place by wedging a round-shaped object between a flat surface on the one end and a single prong on opposite side of stone. Here is the Top View of the ring (SCALE 2:1), the O's represent each stone and support structure, where X marks the location of missing stone.... |x>&lt;O>&lt;O>&lt;O>&lt;O|All we could do is count our good fortune that we were not planning to use it in wedding ceremony.
",2
5555,"You get what you pay for in a cheap ring. These stones are very milky, white appearing and don't sparkle much--I guess that is what J-K means. The shipping was fast and packing good. There is a prong on either end of the ring that catches on things. I didn't notice when I purchased but after putting on I noticed right away and it concerned me that I may scratch my kids with it. My husband called the ring ""gaudy"". I plan on returning it. It might work for you if you just want a diamond ring and don't care if the stones are milky because it is a really, really good price.
",2
5558,"I really love this because it looks pretty in the light with the ""pearlized"" style...however....after eating and brushing your teeth the pearl like stuff comes off and its just clear. The same goes for the colored ones like this...I put the red one in this morning and now its just plain red with no different color....kinda sucks
",2
5569,"I bought these for a gift and was surprised to find them much smaller than I expected. Plus, the links were pretty shabily made (you can see the seam and the links aren't smooth -- they almost look coated). I was pretty disappointed. I've bought several other things from SilverSpeck which were much nicer and much better made, for a lot less money. Alas, I'm returning these. On a plus note - when I called SilverSpeck to return them (even tho more than 30 days had passed) - the guy was very helpful and just told me to send in the exchange info. Kudos on the customer service!
",2
5578,"I was so disappointed in these earrings. Only one earring looked like an elephant, the other just looked like a blob of silver. I bought them as a gift and refused to give them as one. I would recommend NOT buying these at all.
",2
5582,"I bought these earrings as a gift for a friend and she loved them. Being sterling silver, they don't bother her ears at all. She loves all things elephant! Such a good price too!
",2
5593,"I was disappointed with this purchase. The turquoise bits turned out much smaller than expected, and the earrings turned out longer.One of the turquoise pieces was larger than the other, resulting in uneven size between the right and the left.Didn't turn out as well as pictured.
",2
5594,"Trumpet was pretty nice, although really small. Was going to send item back but didn't want to have to pay restocking fee and shipping charges. Item did not come with little silver attachment for attaching the charm to necklace so is of no use. Wasted my money.
",2
5607,"I thought this tongue ring was quite attractive and unsual so I bought it. It is however notvery practical to wear. The studs on the top are rough and cut the palette. It cannot be worn for extended periods of time because it is uncomfortable. I would not recommend this product
",2
5702,"I have seen almost identical rings to this one that are real that go for a couple of hundred dollars. So when I saw this for $20.00 I was thrilled. When I got it and opened the box it was immediately notable that the mother of pearl looking cameo face was very very off centered when glued on the black stone. It was lower than it should be. I will return this ring most likely. If it were centered it would be pretty but you can see a very slight glue edge. As I said for the price if the face were in the center I would keep the ring. Very disappointing. The shipping however was extremely fast and I liked the free cleaning cloth that was included.
",2
5704,"I ordered it for my daughter who is a duck lover, but unfortunately had to return it due to being way overpriced due to its tiny size. It would be a good buy for $25.
",2
5730,"The earrings are pretty; however I do have trouble inserting in my ear as the posts are large
",2
5734,"Although the necklace was advertised as wood with metal accents,the ""metal"" accents are so cheaply made that it's more appropriate for a child's dress-up game. And the wood is poorly sanded and cracked in places. It certainly doesn't look polished. I did wear it out once, but I probably won't again.
",2
5737,"I did order this online through amazon, but did not feel that this is what I thought it to be. The beads are huge, and honestly, I don't think I will wear it. Problem is, when it was sent, nothing was ever said ""if you are not satisfied with the purchase please call (insert number here) or send it back in this envelope...I will even pay the postage, I just don't care for it as I the image and description made me believe I would.The price was great, I thought I was getting a great deal. But when I pulled it out of the package, I saw that the beads were big and not quite as long as I expected either.Sorry.

5827,"the product arrived and the bottom ring was broken or bent. the columns are too close together and doesn't give adequate room in between for long earrings. It is great if you have a lot of small, short length earrings. allows for lots of them to be placed on the rack.

5917,"I returned this because the horizontal bars were not all straight, some of the earring holes were off center, and the horizontal bar connections to the frame were not flush. It may have just been that I got a defect.
",2
5969,"The shipping was great it got here in no time, butttttttttt the necklace left something to be desired. It was rough and had gouges. It still looked great from afar. I think it was a ok buy, but for 20 dollars i can live with it.

5977,"I wasn't expecting alot for the price. But I was really disappointed in my pearls. Every pearl had a very noticeable flaw on it.

5987,"When I got it, the top ball was a different color than the rest of the ring and had glitter in it. Defeats the purpose of being clear.
",2
5989,"The pendant was smaller than I expected, even based on the dimensions given - maybe I just couldn't picture the size. The blue topaz stone was a little light in color. I ordered this with a pair of blue topaz earrings which I didn't keep, so I really didn't need to keep the pendant. I returned the items together for a refund and was very pleased at the speed at which I got the refund. I was also pleased at the speed of delivery of the items.
",2
6011,"I got this for my wife as a present. She loved the locket, sadly the chain is very frail and broke after about 10 days. If purchasing understand that chain will probably need to be replaced.
",2
6020,"While the pendant itself is beautiful the first time it was sent broken and tangled. I wrote a lengthy letter explaining that this was intended to be a Christmas gift and I needed an exchange right away. I asked that the exchanged item be made sure that the latch worked properly, easily opening and closing without breaking. The exchanged item was very difficult to open and I was afraid it might break. Eventually, it opened using jewelry pliers. The hinge looks fragile and not made well. For something that is supposed to be a locket, it does not act like it. Beyond the poor construction, the only paper sent back to me was a copy of my invoice with a sloppy ""exchange"" hand written over it. A simple courtesy letter apologizing briefly would have sufficed, especially since I had to pay shipping to send it back to them. No level of recognition was made to me. Any business should know to at least have a stock letter to the customer in dealing with any problem. I do it for my own clients and I expect the same of every other business, no matter how big or small. I will not be buying from them again.
",2
6021,"The piece is beautiful and it's comfortable to wear, looks GREAT. But after only a couple months the pendant is worn out looking and stained. Looks awful. I won't wear it anymore.
",2
6022,"I had the necklace for a couple weeks and the chain broke. It was not a good chain to start with but since I only had it for a couple weeks I didn't expect to have to replace it so soon. The pendant itself is pretty, if you are okay with replacing the chain then its an okay buy!
",2
6045,"The stud was as described. The backs were so tiny I could hardly hold them to put them on and then the first time I wore them one of the backs came off and was lost.Sybil
",2
6065,"The box arrived w/what looked like mold/water damage all along the exterior. It also smelled unpleasant. Being that it was a Christmas gift I had no time to return it, so I sanded it down & cleaned it up. It was usable after a fair amount of reconstructive effort. Beyond that it is a pretty box & a tight but perfect fit for the standard set of tarot cards.
",2
6116,"This bracelet is thin and small and cheap. The catch broke the first time I put it on. The people were nice but the second bracelet I ordered to replace it came with a broken clasp! And then I measured it and it was 9 INCHES long!!!! It was advertised as 7 1/2 inches!!! Not a quality company!
",2
6143,"I ordered this for my 3 yr old son who loves his cousin's musical box. There arent very many out there for boys! He was so happy when he opened it.....but within a few hours, we discovered that the actual music piece was not even secured to the box at all, and the little spinning doggie kept getting stuck on the platform. My little boy never even wound it up...only mommy and daddy. This box is very flimsy and there are pieces inside that look like they should be glued down, but arent. What a difference in the quality of the disney boxes as compared to this one! My husband is going to try to fix it....who knows! If I knew....I would never have spent this kind of money on it!

6185,"$70 !!!??? for these tiny hoops makes them extremely overpriced. Should they be put on sale for 1/2 price they'd still be too much.Just bought identical pairs of ( also .925 sterling) earrings for my nieces for $12.99 a pair from a local discount department store whose name begins with TJ.
",2
6187,"I was so excited to get these earrings and when I opened them, I was very disappointed. They are tiny! I should have looked at the measurements more carefully, but I figured they would be a ""normal size"" hoop - not a thin ""huggie"" style - especialy for $70!! Also, they are not very shinny. I am returning them.
",2
6196,"The price I paid was great for what I hoped I was getting. When the necklace arrived the fresh water pearls were so ugly, they were much larger then the picture showed and they had pointed ends....very weird shaped. I have never worn the necklace, it will remain in the box until my little girl wants to wear some play jewelry.

6466,"This unit is very heavy. Two people are required for installation. Plus, the installation with three anchors placed in inconvenient locations is not practical and does not add any strength to hold it on the wall. I would never have purchased this if I had known how difficult it is to install. I would purchase the lighter ones that give you the flexibility of hanging over the door as well as the wall.

6654,"Perhaps I should have read the description more carefully, but my expectation was that these would be delicate silver earrings. (Hey, maybe doorknocker should have meant something to me...but live, shop and learn!)These earrings are HUGE! I'm 5 feet 8 inches tall and 135 lbs, so I'm no Audrey Hepburn, but these are enormous, showgirl earrings meant to be seen all the way from the backrow.In addition, while they are nice, big, shiny earrings, they also appear to be nice, BIG, shiny earrings on tiny, fragile stems to go through the ears. In fact, the stems are so small and soft that even if these earrings were my style, I would be afraid to wear them for fear that the stems would crack leaving me scuttling to retrieve earrings I don't even like.Hmmm, perhaps something to ""regift"" to a flashier friend for a costume party.

6699,"The earrings look OK - certainly not like the picture, but they seem nice enough. I don't have a great eye for this sort of thing, so we'll see how it goes. She could love them.The big problem I have is that I selected these in part because of the quantity/quality of positive reviews but there is another reason they are there: Inside the packaging, it says if you review your purchase here on Amazon, you'll be entered in a once a month drawing for diamonds.That's some BS. Very easy/scummy way to get people to write positive reviews, whether justified or not. I guarantee some of these 5* ratings come from people who are just doing so for the shot at free diamonds.It might still be a good purchase, but be careful.

6732,"I wasn't expecting a lot from these earrings, and although they are generally what I wanted (to replace stolen ones) the quality of the jade was not good.

6801,"Based on how lovely the first pair of earrings that I ordered from Gem Avenue were (the little turquoise and black beaded ones pictured and sold now as a due with these)and the rave reviews here, I was anxious to add these to my wardrobe. But sadly, these aren't at all like the first pair though they closely resemble the turquoise pair in the pictures. Simply put I wouldn't have purchased these at all had I seen them. They are a flat cheap looking silver mounting, and the blue (stones??) are much darker than pictured and honestly they look like plastic beads from a cheap jewelry making kit!! According to this ad, these earrings originally sold for $40 and are now on sale for $20! I would've walked away from them completely had I seen them in a shop. I WILL give Gem Avenue a star for prompt delivery AND the earrings were packaged beautifully sealed in a tiny bag inside a nice gift box. But the product itself is sub par. I can't believe these earrings got all these stars!!! I am returning them for my $20 that I can spend on products with this same company that ARE far and away more superior.

6828,"I ordered this expecting that the links would be fairly small from the picture. They aren't, the links on each of the extenders are very large, and don't match any other jewelry I own.

6912,"Usually, buying jewelry online is either a HIT or a MISS, i guess in my case this time, it's a miss. Theses pearls were all clearly blemished, and it's very creamy color (NOT LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN, which look like perfect white pearls), the luster is true, medium as stated. However, there were a lot of pearls by the knot were chipped, those pearls looks kinda like it had been cover with cheap nail polish and now starting to peeling off. If you are looking for a pearl necklace to treasure or to show off, this is NOT it. Trust me, spend a couple more hundreds, you can find a much better pearl necklace that you can treasure and be proud of it later. My plastic pearls strand looks way better than this one (which cost me less than $5), and it looks better with my outfit too.

7371,"the earring would have been better if it was smaller. they are about 1 inch long and very light in weight. not bad for the price tho! i just expected something a lot smaller.

7503,"Not what I wanted at all, the wrong colour and it barely fits around my neck. I pretty much threw it out as soon as I got it.

7519,"I ordered this ring in a size 8. When I received my order, the order size was crossed off and a size 7 inserted. (ASIN:B000F19QZE 3/8"" (10 mm) Sterling Silver Hand Made Ring with Musical Note]] If I wanted a size 7, I would have specified it, but it would have been too small. I sent it back, because it was too small.
",2
7537,"I just received this bracelet which I ordered as a Christmas present. While the bracelet itself is very pretty, I am unfortunately disappointed overall. There isn't a clasp to lock the bracelet once it is opened(granted I should have read the description more carefully). The side of the bracelet opens, allowing one to easily slip it on. However, when you close the bracelet it doesn't remain closed (maintaining the closed image of the barcelet on the site). I will be returning this and now must find another gift!!
",2
7552,"where is my stuff, i still not received yetplease response my review, and make me happy to buy from amazon.com
",2
7559,"I ordered these as an ""extra"" gift for my Mom. It would have been an embarrassment to give these to her. They are so small that they would go through the piercing hole in her ear. Very, very disappointed. I am returning for my $46.00 refund.
",2
7571,"Purchased these earrings for $29.99 around Christmas during a Gold Box deal. For thirty bucks, I figured why not? Well, when the package arrived, I opened it to find a small pouch. I am not exaggerating when I say it took me five minutes to find these tiny, tiny earrings in the pouch. I had to turn the pouch inside out to find them! Even for thirty dollars, I don't feel these earrings are right for an adult. Maybe a toddler or infant. Wound up sending them back, thanks to Amazon's super return policy.
",2
7574,"While I suppose I shouldn't expect much for $30, the picture of the earrings on an ear showed that they would be bigger than what they are. They are tiny little things, though overall they look nice. I was just expecting an earring that was at least twice the size.
",2
7580,"my 10 yr old son bought this for his mom and if i had my way they would be returned,the stones look pastey and nothing like the picture
",2
7581,"Hope the wife doesn't kill me! On a budget, and it seemed like these would be a nice gift from the photo, which is pretty misleading. Oh well. No going back now, it's too close to Xmas.
",2
7587,"The earrings I purchased were very disappointing, because of their size. They are baby-size!You need to advertise the size of the product!
",2
7588,"The image online DEFINITELY magnifies these earrings. I've owned 1/10 ct stones before and I'd have to say I'm in the process of taking these to a jewler to have them verified. There is barely no setting to them at all. They are so tiny and so cheaply set that they could very possibly slip right through the hole in your ear if you're not careful. Were they worth the money even though it was a really good price? NO. Don't waste your money or even your time looking at these.
",2
7589,"The image online DEFINITELY magnifies these earrings. NO. Don't waste your money or even your time looking at these.
",2
7590,"I guess the price should have been a clue, but these earrings are so small that they have slipped out of my ear on 2 occasions. Probably OK for child.
",2
7592,"Not sure that they are diamonds in gold. They hurt my ears,when theyre not suppost to. I cant take fake,my ears hurt unless they are gold.
",2
7636,"Even though the purpose of these earrings were for my 13 yr old daughter .. she asked for stud earrings, however, they are barely visible. I was very disappointed when I opened the box. Also the backing on one of the earrings bent very easily when we took them out of the packaging.
",2
7638,"They are nice but smaller than what I expected. They could be suitable for a very young girl who is less than 10 years.I am glad that were good for my daughter.Thank you.Saeed
",2
7643,"So tiny! I got them for my mom but I had to give it to my newborn niece. Cannot see the diamonds...just a little spark in the middle. So remember: ""you get what you pay for""
",2
7651,"Picture and product differed in what I expected. I gave them to a friend who had a baby and they were jsut the right size for a 2 month old.
",2
7659,"I returned the item because they were much smaller than I anticipated. Picture is somewhat misleading. However return was simple and easy.
",2
7660,"After buying the diamond stud earring I was disappoint with the size of the earrings looking at the picture will fool you telling the truth is the answer a buyer want not to be fool
",2
7674,"I purchased this about two and half weeks ago along with some other things. the other things have arrived, and yet this hasn't even been shipped. the estimated delivery is over two weeks, which means I will have waited over a month to receive the earrings by the time I finally get it. That is bad service. I will write another review rating the actual product when I receive it. Had I known it would take so long, I would have just paid more and went to the jewelry store down the street.
",2
7681,"They appear to be much larger in the description. Expensive for the size. Made in china And not packaged nice for giving as a gift
",2
7684,"The picture is deceiving. I thought they were going to be bigger but they are smaller than a pea. Probably won't be buying much jewelry from here no more.
",2
7686,"I ordered two pair. They are both small, which I expected for the price. One pair is pretty. The other is milky in color. I was not very happy with that pair. I decided to keep those and give the other pair as a gift. I am a little embarrassed with the gift being so small.
",2
7688,"There's nothing really wrong with them other than they're small my fault for not realizing that. Packaging could use some work though because both posts were bent due to someone using a necklace display instead of an earring display inside the box.
",2
7696,"The earings were well crafted but one diamond had a defect so I returned the set. They were also much smaller than I expected (a good size for baby jewelry).
",2
7698,"Never purchased earrings on line however i gave it a shot and wasnt to happy, the earrings are so tiny but it will not keep me from going threw amazon.
",2
7710,"these ear rings are super tiny. they are meant like for a baby and since they are baby sized, they should probly have the back that screws on. Didn't like them because of the size and I find it a hassle to return so gonna have to give them away as a gift to someone with a baby.
",2
7763,"The bracelet is not what I expected. I was getting the bracelet to go with a black stoned sterling silver ring I have. The bracelet looks like costume jewelry, it is not something you would wear with a nice piece of jewelry. I have not returned it, because I hate going to the trouble of doing it.
",2
7765,"I had loved it at first, but I am one to leave a necklace on forever. It started to get all kinked up and I couldn't figure out how to straighten it out. But the company did offer me a discount on a different chain, even though it was past their 30 day policy. Nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it.
",2
7862,"I bought this and loved it, but after about a week the whole thing started tarnishing and no amount of polishing or cleaning made it better. Now I basically have a blakened piece of junk that is too ugly to wear. If I had to do it over again, I'd try coating the whole thing with a clear nail polish or some other kind of clear sealant to keep it from ruining like that.
",2
7865,"The pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design. It does not go with the center design. I think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look. Pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either.
",2
7876,"I bought this as a gift but the glue won't hold and the stones keep falling out and now some of them are lost, so I now i have to find a different style to replace this one. For what I paid, the pentacle is lovely and the quality would have been excellent if the stones were affixed some other way.
",2
7896,"I ordered this necklace because of the reviews and I liked how it looked. It got to me in decent time and when I opened it it looked as offered. The chain itself is cheap but because of reading the reviews I was ready for that and ordered a different chain along with it. I am glad I did because the clasp to the original chain is so stiff and nearly impossible to open. With the new chain it looked wonderful but by the end of the first day most of the green had flaked off of the pentacle. I really wanted to keep that extra pop of color on it and thought that it might stand up to at least a couple months of wear before it started flaking instead of a day. So because of the chain quality and the very limited life on the paint I have given it 2 stars.
",2
7898,"Since I am allergic to silver, I was happy to see a pentacle that was made of another kind of metal. I had been eying several other pieces from Silver Insanity and a few other makers. That's when I noticed the Pewter pieces. Pan's Pentacle is a beautiful piece of jewelry. The green and almost silver looking metal of the piece are gorgeous. The design is also unique and interesting.There are some problems that cropped up with extended use. The pentacle gets tarnished quick and is virtually impossible to clean. 6 months after wearing it the vibrant colors are gone, and all of my attempts to clean it have come to naught. The chain that came with it was also unfortunate. I specifically chose the design b/c it was made of pewter and not silver, and yet the chain itself was made of silver, so it was necessary to use another chain in order to wear the necklace (It was also not as good a quality as the pentacle). I was initially pleased with the purchase, but my inability to return the piece to its initial glory has soured me.
",2
7900,"I purchased this item and within about two hours of having it on, all the green came off! I didn't have it on in the shower, have anything rubbing up against it, or do anything to it that would cause it to come off. When I sent the company an email with my issues it took them a couple days to get back to me, actually after a week I sent the email again and then they finally got back to me. As much as I liked the design of it, I picked it because of the added color. When I explained that the color came off for no reason, I was told that I had to pay to ship it back and then they could send me a new one or I could just order a new one. To say that customer service was lacking is an understatement.
",2
7953,"I accidentally fell asleep with these on and they tore My ear because the backings are not tight at all. I tossed the awful, sharp backings that the earrings come with and took some earring stabilizers off another set of earrings I have and now they aren't loose and they don't hang.If you don't know what an earring stabilizer looks like, here is a link to some:Earring Stabilizers - 3 PairsConsidering the weight and length of these earring, they really should come with earring stabilizers instead of the tiny backings currently included.Aside from the issues with the backings, the posts of the earrings are crooked. Probably due to them being shipped in a plastic bag with no protection. I am also a bit worried that at any point a garnet will fall out because the setting is loose. For now, they sit in My jewelry box until I decide what to do with them.For the trouble and the price, I wouldn't buy these and I'm glad I didn't. They were a gift.*After reading a review about how someone got these for ""about $10"", I think they're also a rip-off. Seems everyone saying ""no one will believe what you paid for them."" gave the sellers the idea to jack up the price to a more ""believable"" one.
",2
7965,"Purchased for myself for a fun piece of jewelry...not pretty. I returned it because I knew it would not be worn.
",2
7971,"These earrings are very small, it is hard to see the beautiful design. That was very disappointing to me.
",2
7972,"I thought the item was gona be a lot bigger than it was. I returned them because they were these little itty bitty earrings, which I would totally not wear.
",2
7974,"I bought these for a gift and was disappointed. They're flimsy and kind of cheap feeling. More like a 5.99 pair of earrings.
",2
7987,"i wore it several times then a chain came loose. i was able to tighten it but then the other chain came loose too and finally one of them broke. too bad, i really like the design, just wish it lasted longer!
",2
7996,"I ordered 2 of them and tried to wear them together, but they still looked thin and cheap. Returned them right away
",2
8007,"I thought it was nice in the photos but when it can it was too large for my wrist. Nice products looked real
",2
8008,"Like an earlier review said. If you can convince anyone that this is real...... It is costume, and as such is inexpensive, but honestly, don't convince yourself that you can wear this at a function and not expect a couple of chuckles behind your back should you decide to act/convince anyone that it is real. I showed it to a couple Jr. League friends and they laughed.
",2
8050,"I was disappointed in the aring.. I thought it was going to show the crystal stones better. I would not get another one nor would I tell anyone to purchase this ring
",2
8068,"I thought the picture looked good, but I didn't like the ring very much once I saw it in person. It's also not very comfortable to wear.
",2
8092,"I got my earrings today, and wow, what a disappointment! There is a lot of black residue in every low point of the design as well as on the ear wire back and parts of the higher elevations on the design. I understand that the ""antiquing"" process will darker certain areas in the lower parts of the design for a more shadowy effect, but its all over these. I even cleaned them in silver cleaner and with a polishing cloth, nothing is taking it off.I am returning and looking elsewhere for some earring like there. Its too bad because other than that one issue I like the style a lot. Maybe it is just my bad luck with amazon in general but I don't think I will be buying jewelry again from amazon. I'll go to a local shop here and probably get a better deal than 30 bucks for not much silver.
",2
8102,"I was expecting a good quality product for the amount of money on this piece. The detail isn't great and I wouldn't buy this again
",2
8151,"I got this ring for my BD last year. It did look much better then on the picture...but after few days of wearing it the leaf part break off :)It`s hard to find a place to fix it.
",2
8224,"I bought this because it looked so pretty and had such good reviews. However 10 days after it was purchased it broke. Not made very well for a bracelette, the metal pc that are the connections are way to thin & fragile. Its VERY light!!!! Wouldnt advise purchase of this
",2
8243,"This bracelet is technically what it is sold as. There were 2 tiny diamonds on the one I received and it took me forever to find them. The sapphires are very included. It does not look bad on the wrist and if you don't plan to have people looking at it too closely it is fine. It does have a nice over all look when being worn. The silver work is good, heavy enough to wear often. The clasp is really nice and has a safety catch.
",2
8272,"I recomend this for a childs gift. Its much smaller than it looks in the picture. On the plus side $8.44 ($2.49 + $5.95 shipping) for a genuine pearl bracelet isnt bad! Beware its very tiny.
",2
8327,"I bought this ring a month ago and wear it every day. It seems to have quite a few scratches for being very new. Since I have an office job I don't do anything that would cause it to have so many scratches already. I assumed that titanium was more durable than gold or silver but I quess not.
",2
8351,"This was better than the earring. You still had to look hard to make out what it was suppose to be.
",2
8386,"The product was fine, but I was taken to the Amazon site to check out, without realizing it. There was very poor communication on the part of the seller as far as the item listing, and extremely poor response to my complaint.
",2
8407,"I was out of town and ordered it for my wife on line. When I was able to see it I was totally shocked how small it was. The picture over stated its size.
",2
8428,"These are cute earrings, but not silver. They are stamped 925, but are attracted to a magnet. Otherwise, nice.
",2
8472,"I found that the bar on these earrings hurt going through my ear. This seems to be a problem with earrings from this company. Also, the silver seemed dull. They were very good about giving me a prompt credit for the return.
",2
8474,"Eves Addiction is a very good retailer. I would buy from them again...just not this ring. I bought this for my wife but when she got it she was very dissapointed. The quality of this ring is pretty poor. We returned it.
",2
8534,"I ordered this one, its a great color, but was defective. The company was great on how they handled the return.
",2
8552,"I bought these for my wife. The earrings were nice but very thin and did not really shine....much smaller than I thought...may get attention but someone may need to be very up close to see them! Looks better in the picture than in real.
",2
8556,"I realize i didn't purchase a piece of fine jewelry but based on the reviews i was hoping to like it enough to wear when i don't want to wear my actual wedding rings. However quality is awful, it looks like it went through a blender. Its so cheaply made that i am embarassed to wear it. I will be returning this.The picture looks 10 times better than the ring did in person.
",2
8561,"My ears are really sensitive and can only wear gold and silver earrings.Had infection after wearing these. So I dun think they were made 100% 925 stealing silver.
",2
8606,"I bought the 2mm size and had to send them right back as the ball came off when I tried to remove the back to try them on. Very disappointing.
",2
8613,"I bought these for $12 which I thought was such a good price. I gave them to my daughter in law and a week later she gave them back in a zip lock. Three stones had fallen off. I fixed them and gave them back. A week later three more stones had fallen off. They are not made well at all.
",2
8616,"when it was delivered to me there were 3 stones missingim very upset
",2
8653,"While these earrings are pretty, the ""gold"" overlay wore off after two wearing. This is JUST wearing during the day, not sleeping with them on or showering. If you want a one-wear earring, this is fine. If you want something that shows quality AND lasts, keep looking.
",2
8672,"For the year it stayed on, I loved it. Then the heart came unscrewed and it fell off without me even knowing. I wouldn't buy another product of Paris's because jewelry should last longer than a year when properly taken care of.
",2
8713,"I love Paris, I love her jewelery but was very sad that one stone was missing when I took it out of the pouch. I loved it so much I was willing to overlook the flaw but a few weeks later I noticed 6 stones missing. I am not hard on my jewelery but this is obviously a quality issue and I will be sending it back for a refund.
",2
8806,"I am 14 years old and I really like Paris Hilton's new jewellery line. The only things I don't like on her jewellery line is this star necklace and the heart necklace on the satin cord. I love all the other pieces but I will probably only buy the star earrings and the heart belly button ring as I just got my belly button pierced. I think its great that I can get jewellery that virtually knowone else will have because I live in the UK.
",2
8809,"My boyfriend bought me this necklace for our anniversary last year. I loved it because it was the only piece of jewelry that he had ever got me and he knew that I am obsessed with Paris Hilton. Soon after I started wearing it, the satin cord came undone from the clasp. I quickly replaced it with a stornger silver necklace. Then, one by one the swarvoski crystals strated to come loose and get lost. As of now, three of the eight crystals are missing. The only reason I still wear it is because it reminds me of my boyfriend, imperfect but thoughtful.
",2
8813,"I'm not sure on this necklace, I think that it looks cheap. If girls get it because they want to be like Paris then at least get the rosary bead cross necklace (Paris has been seen wearing this a lot). I like most of the Paris Hilton jewellery the worst buys being this and the star necklace on the cord. If you want to buy something from her jewellery line I would recommend that you get one of the necklaces with a real silver chain not a cord chain that will get ruined easily.
",2
8825,"I really like this, but cannot order this as it will not ship here to Canada.................grrr
",2
8875,"I bought this as a christmas present for my girlfriend. I thought b/c it is sterling silver it would be good to go, but apparently it is just cheap b/c now there is a green ring around her finger. I'm annoyed and want my money back! Now I seem like a cheap-o that can't pick out a good ring...BS.
",2
8940,"I bought this for my daughter but she did not get to wear it at all. The hoops are so tiny and the lock is so cumbersome that I could not even put it on her. I had to return them.
",2
8944,"earrings are too small and the post are very soft and bend very easily. Would not buy again or recommend
",2
8952,"I purchased these earrings as replacements for an earring I lost. The size is OK (difficult to determine on-line) the actual diameter of the tube is much finer than expected. I wear these 24/7 as I did my original set and have had them for about a week. The earrings are changing color - they look stained - kind of redish which 14k gold should not do unless subjected to something like iodine. These earring have had nothing but shampoo and water touch them. I will most likely be returning them.I contacted Earrings Direct and was told they could do nothing for me even though the issue is defective product related. They told me to ""polish them"". Do not use this firm - they have very poor customer service.
",2
8985,"THE CLOSURE FOR THE EARINGS WAS NOT SECURE, AS A RESULT, EVERYTIME ANYTHING BRUSHED AGAINST YOUR EAR THE CLOSURE CAME UNDONE AND, WITHIN TWO WEEKS, I LOST ONE EARING.THIS TYPE OF CLOSURE IS NOT PRACTICLE FOR ANYONE WHO IS REMOTELY ACTIVE.
",2
8987,"I purchased these as a gift for my mother. She saw them on Amazon andasked that I buy them for her. She ended up returning them because thepost did not seem secure. It did not extend deep enough into the hollowhoop end, and seemed as though the earring would fall out of the ear prettyeasily.
",2
8989,"Thought that the peridot would be darker or brighter and was surprised at the band that looked like an eternity ring. The large stone looks more yellow than green. But as time goes on, I find that it looks great with all my yellow tops.
",2
9003,"The pearl was great! However, the silk cord is too hard to get on and is not big enough for an adult to wear
",2
9014,"Taking into account the rest of the reviews...I must've gotten a bad copy. The ring itself would be beautiful if it were cut or molded right. The points in the center don't line up. Also the sides of the cross aren't parallel. They are definitely slanted. Going to return this asap. For almost $80...I expected much better.
",2
9093,"My grandmother gave this to me last year, and I loved it. It tarnished quickly, and when I tried to clean it, the black coloring in the word engraving came off. Pretty bracelet in the box.
",2
9110,"The necklace Cord for Pendants was not the size I expected. By that I mean that the cord was very narrow. It did not have the thickness that I thought that I was getting and the clasp was so small that most would people find it hard to use. An extremely very poor value at $5.49 for each one!
",2
9125,"Watch out, buyers--this ring is NOT sterling silver. It turned my finger green in less than 24 hours. I love the design; it's very unique, but it is not what it has been advertised as. I had to use the clear nail polish method to keep it from turning my finger green. If you want a cool ring that is not actual silver, then this is the ring for you. Otherwise, don't bother.
",2
9130,"I was not at all happy with this ring when it arrived. It did not look at all like the picture, but flatter and rougher around the edges. Please note that the braiding does not go all the way around. This is clear in the picture, but I did not notice before I ordered it. Also, the sizing was a bit on the small side.
",2
9132,"Unlike in the photo, the ring doesn't have the design completely around the ring. There is about a two or three millimetre section that is solid silver. Also, some of the strands of silver look broken instead of woven under another strand like in the product picture. I would keep in mind that since the ring isn't a solid band, it may bend easily.
",2
9165,"Bought to fit on a pandora bracelet. Too small for that. Otherwise it is a nice charm.
",2
9178,"It hasn't been easy finding a decent box for the ring I got for my fiance. Truth be told, this is slightly better than the three others I've ordered online recently only to throw them away as soon as I got them. This could have been so much better if someone had picked a better color and material for the hinge which is cheap looking and poorly installed. The wood finish was also poorly done with small areas missed during the varnish application. Great company to deal with, unfortunately not a great product considering the reason why the average customer would order this.
",2
9188,"Be warned, this product does not look quite the same as the picture might have you believe.You'll notice that the leather in the picture appears to be a subtle off-white while the real thing is a blinding pure white.Also, the interior is constructed somewhat differently than depicted.What is truly disappointing is the box itself.You'll notice that the box depicted appears to be a smooth brownish-red in color. In reality the color is vibrant red. I'm talking clown nose red. I'm talking call girl's lipstick red.The varnish or lacquer or whatever it is is applied so thickly there's no telling whether this is truly cherry wood or not.If the above described seems like something you'd like to purchase, know there are similar items sold here on Amazon for less.VERY DISAPOINTING.
",2
9205,"This pair of earrings were nice but the gold detailing on them was not complete so I was rather disappointed.
",2
9231,"Cute ring but the silver is so thin that it broke within 2 days of wearing it. Low quality item.
",2
9238,"They're okay. A lot bigger than they look, and the stone's actually look kinda fake. Not something I'll be wearing often (in fact, I've not worn them once since I received them about three months ago)
",2
9267,"The first time I tried to put these on, the prong broke. How do I return them for being defective?
",2
9297,"I have several genuine swarovski crystals that were expensive in comparison to the one I am reviewing . My daughter purchased one in Austria and I wore it everyday for about 2 years. I have several others that I purchased at mall kiosks and all have held up well. Although the crystal I am reviewing is beautiful, I have only had it for a few weeks and have noticed that it already has several chips. One side of the crystal actually has a noticeable gouge out of it. I can't explain how this has happened since I have not been scaling walls or rolling in sandpits recently (joke). All I can say is that the other crystal, several years older, that I have been wearing at the same time, is fine. It's not a huge loss, since the crystal was quite cheap. I guess ""you get what you pay for"" applies in this case.
",2
9350,"The ""simulated diamond cut"" looks a lot prettier in the picture than it does in person. In the picture, there is at least a vague semblance of diamonds. The actual product, however, does not have the appearance at all. Instead, it looks like a fancy paper clip.On a positive note, they are lightweight and would not drag down your earlobes.
",2
9378,"These Artazia pieces are pretty, but if you're looking for Star of David necklaces that embody more of the mystical power and sacred symbolism of the Star of David you might prefer to check out David Weitzman's work (more info in my profile.) I find the Artazia pieces a little to ""out there"" and interpretive, not quite as magical and lovely as they should be.
",2
9408,"I loved this ring. I bought and received another one as well as earrings from this vendor at the same time. Much to my surprise and disappointment, one of the stones fell out today. I don't want to go to the trouble to return it so I glued it back ... I hope I don't lose anymore stones. :-(
",2
9416,"While I was specifically looking for this exact charm and was delighted to find it, I am less than thrilled with how long it has lasted. The pink little girls dress fell off of the gold girl charm in less than two weeks. While the charm still looks presentable and no one can tell unless they look really closely, it was a disappointment.
",2
9417,"A dingy muddled piece with low brilliance, and a chunky chain. Promised presentation case was not provided as advertised, came in a cheap drawstring bag. But there is no time to return and replace due to counting on item for a birthday present. Marginally acceptable transaction. The only good aspect was on time shipping. Whoopie ! Never again. Jewelry should be bought at a store not sight unseen - expensive lesson.
",2

The pattern is etched so low and thin only you can see it and only when you hold it close to your face ... and I have 20/15 vision. If you want to show support, this is, sadly, not going to do the trick. I gave them 2 stars only because the size was correct and the material seems to be good. If you insist on buying it ... tell everone what it is so they know.

This necklace is paper thin, and looks like it will not last long at all. The other reviewers who said they were getting this for a boyfriend? This is not a ""guy"" chain at all. The balls are teeny..it nowhere at all resembles those ""dog-tag"" chain type necklaces if that is what you are looking for. If you are looking for a nice DAINTY chain for a woman, it would be okay. The seller however was nice enough to write me back about a refund (why I gave 2 stars,)but it was Christmas time and I was just too busy, so didn't get it done.

9689,"When I received this bracelet, I was happy with the look. It was pretty and the photo heart was an appropriate size. Well, when I tried to insert the picture into the heart, it was next to impossible! A heart is not an easy shape to cut a small picutre into, anyway, but this was insane!! When I finally did get the picture into it, I could not get the plastic cover back on. When I did, it ended up looking really cheap. This bracelet was good in theory, just not good in reality. Next time I will buy a necklace with an oval locket!

9709,"In browsing the jewelry section of amazon.com, I came across what appeared to be a great deal . . . this Floating Heart Pendant with Diamond by Samuel Jewelers. The online image looked lovely and the thought of a diamond and white-gold combination for under $50 was very appealing. I purchased the item. . . . I received the necklace earlier today and I must say, I am VERY disappointed with it. The piece is much smaller than I thought it would be -- diamond is practically invisible, the white-gold chain itself isn't at all elegant or eye-appealing, and because the chain is so delicate, thin, it makes it very difficult to put on and remove the necklace. Do not waste your money on this. Buy your girl/woman a dozen roses instead!
",2
9724,"I purchased this for my 88 y.o. grandmother for Christmas...Came giftwrapped, so I didn't see the product till Christmas morning...I was quite disappointed. The diamond grade is poor, and the pendant is white gold, yet the chain is silver and is so fragile and small, that I nearly broke it when I took it out of the box for her. The clasp are so small, that she cant put it on herself....I bought a white gold chain that is bigger...looks great now.

There was a glitch with the Amazon site and a duplicate order was placed for the item from Samuels Jewelers and an item directly from Amazon.Amazon fixed the issue with their item right away.After making five attempts (both via email and voice mail) to contact Samuels Jewelers I got zero response and have STILL gotten no response at all.I had to refuse the order and only got a partial refund, I'm assuming it was partial because of shipping fees. I would contact the buyer about this but it seems pointless as they don't respond to their customers anyway.

9744,"These 'pearls' are beautiful and a great deal. But be wary because they are so heavy, that the clasp is prone to breaking- and sadly, you can't return them for new ones from this seller. It's only possible to get a refund and reorder the same necklace, but after all the hassle I don't want to risk it with the same product. Very sad as I liked the pearls a lot. Maybe I got a defective one?

10055,"Unless every ruler in my house is wrong, the measurements of this chain are not accurately reported. The beads are 2mm rather than 3mm... Is it the end of the world? No, I didn't send the necklace back, but I would have preferred what 3mm which is what I thought I was ordering. Also with the clasp included, the necklace is a little longer than 22"".

It's gone -- probably never to be found. These are pretty, but be sure to use your own larger backs.

10117,"These earrings are very pretty and nice. However I was looking for earrings for my second hole and they were much larger than I had expected - too large for a second hole. If you like wearing studs on your first hole, these would probably be nice (but still quite large for studs). Appeared to be great quality. I did end up returning them though, since they were larger than I had expected.

10149,"The ball earrings are beautiful and I was very disappointed to find that the posts are so short, what you would expect to find on earrings for a small child. The posts were also thin, but that was okay. Also, the tension backs were so tiny, I had a hard time handling them. If I had purchased them for the Jan 2007 price, I might have kept them and had new posts and backs put on by my local jeweler. The photo shows the posts and backs to be more substantial. Sadly, I have to return them.

The downside to this is that the circle connector that comes with the charm very easily gets separated and the charm falls off. We had to go to the hardware store to get something a little more stable so that it wouldn't fall off and get lost forever.
",2
10258,"I agree with the prior reviewer who said the rubber bands start breaking. I had it about a month and wore it nearly every day when I noticed that the rubber bands which were at first neatly concealed, began to shred and break - thus poking through between the bands which make up this otherwise charming piece.Also please note that it is 'silver tone' - NOT sterling, so it also tarnishes easily and can cause discoloration of skin in metal sensitive wearers (like myself).I stopped wearing it due to the unsightly rubber strings poking through. I plan to visit a craft store for some jewelry making supplies to salvage it since I do love the sentiment and quaint charm of the piece nonetheless.

Unfortunately, about a week later, the flimsy latch finally gave way after several attempts by me to keep the ring from suddenly popping open. I emailed the company right away to see if I could send it back for repair, and over a week later, have still not received a reply from them.I love this ring and will go to a local jeweler to see if the latch can be repaired, but am very upset that I have not heard back from Silver Insanity. I would definitely think twice before purchasing any of their products again.

10625,"These earrings, though pretty, are very easily smudged. For something intended to be worn against the skin, this is a BIG NO, NO. When you first put the earrings on (after washing) they are sparkly and pretty. However, about an hour later, after bobbing against one's skin (particularly those of us with oily skin, I suspect) they look like a completely different pair of earrings. The oily smudges on them change the look from sparkly crystal, to cheap plastic. For a decoration (not worn on the body), the material is great, however as an earing, I wouldn't recommend them.

10746,"Edges of this tag are not rounded, therefore they are kind of irritating. The red paint wore off quickly. I have many metal allergies. The Medic-alert symbol is attached to the tag using a rivet which is not hypoallergenic, so it caused my skin to react. I do not recommend this necklace to anyone who has sensitive skin. I had another brand of necklace (I believe it was Emerg), which lasted for years before the links in the chain separated when when it caught on something and broke.

Everything's different- the stone, the stone's colour, the style of the chain. Really disappointing. And they are much longer than you'd think. Won't be returning because after paying for shipping i'll only have some couple of bucks left. Not worthy

10962,"The item arrivied quickly in a matter of four or five days. The quality of the cloth is suspect in that it appears stale and does not perform as I had hoped it would. I am still using a liquid product, BRASSO, and then polishing with the cloth. End cost of the cloth was $10.00 with shipping. A can of BRASSO is a buck and a half and old T shirts cost zero. Perhaps the cloths have out-lived their shelf lives.

I had planned to use this cloth as a drawer liner for my silver jewelry, which of course won't work with a big seam down the middle. So, beware. It does polish, though not spectacularly. I'd look for a better cloth.

Can't get into the nooks of some of my more detailed jewelry and actually left a piece of cloth wedged in my Tiffany mesh bracelet :-( The liquids seem to work better.

11280,"You have to admit that this is a pretty ugly ring. The color looks off next to my olive skin. I wouldn't have bought it except that it was supposed to glow in the dark. This, it does not do. I have exposed it to plenty of light and tested it in total darkness, and I still couldn't see a thing. What a disappointment! Would have been better if at least it had been a better color, like pink.

The item did arrive quickly and in good condition (if a little ugly to begin with), though.If you are thinking of buying this or another item...consider the other item.
",2
11355,"I am disappointed in the way this ring looks when it is actually on a finger...It is VERY wide and the particular ring I got (I believe they are all different) looks crude and amateurish, with gaping ""holes"" in the wirework. That said, when twisted the right way the ring is surprisingly comfortable and I think the ring could look very striking on someone with very long, very slender fingers. I am planning on wiring stone beads into the gaps of the ring and giving it to my daughter, whose fingers are more suited to the style...we shall see what she thinks of it!

11395,"This ring is Beautiful and artistic, however, after wearing it off and on for about a week, one of the wire split, leaving two sharp ends exposed. i tried to sorta 'bend' them into the design, where they wouldn't be dangerous or noticable; but it just didn't work. after braving the danger, another wire or two broke.i'd say i put medium wear on my jewelry and i realize this is somewhat fragile, but i definately expected more from it and was disappointed. Now i'm not sure WHAT to do with it.I'd think twice unless you have a super-cushy job that doesn't require getting your hands dirty or frequent washing. DEFINATELY not a ring for a mom!!!
",2
11400,"I was disappointed with the quality of this ring. It's very feminine but cheaply thrown together... looks like something a child made. If it were of a better quality, this would be a beautiful ring. Some of the wire work is scrunched together and clumped, not like its pictured. I guess you get what you pay for.
",2
11410,"I purchased this item based on it's rave reviews and different look. It is lovely and very different from other rings I have purchased. It is also horribly uncomfortable. There are pieces that cut into my fingers because they are sharp and unfinished. After an hour of wearing, I am dying to take it off and my skin is irritated. Now it is a lovely adornment for my jewelery box and not much else. :(

Shipping costs would normally prohibit their purchase (as it as much as the earrings) but it was a 'crunch time' gift. I don't know if they fell apart as she lost one the next day. Oh, well....

",2
11624,"I was disappointed when this arrived. The quality is poor and uneven on the cross. There is no clarity on the body or the face on this crucifix.The chain is very weak and costume jewelry quality. Spend more money and buy either white gold or yellow gold combined with platinum.

11654,"The charm is very pretty in person. This is the third on all of different birthstones that I have purchased and 2 of the 3 has already lost stones. This one in particular lost a stone withing 2 weeks.

11816,"This has finally arrived! It took 8 days.Upon inspection, it is much prettier in the picture than in person.the sizing is nice, and it stands up pretty tall. The amethyst stone is a beautiful rich purple, very natural looking, and the polished silver is very bright.My only complaints, and why I had to give it 2 stars:1. the well of the ""V"" that holds the amethyst isn't polished, it looks barely sanded. IT detracts from the face of the ring.2. the CZ are not even as close to sparkly as they are in the picture, even under florescent lighting.3. the band is so thin, that with everyday wearing, the band will break soon.For $24, it's ok. But if I had seen it in a store, I wouldn't have purchased this. (hence the 2 stars instead of 3.)

Unfortunately, when I opened the jewelry box to look at my new pearls, what I saw was not the purple strand I had ordered and expected, but a sandy/peach strand. It's a beautiful necklace, and I'll probably give them to my mother for Christmas, but I was wanting purple to go with my chosen outfit.

11840,"I was so excited when I found this ring as my wedding band, although I ran into a few problems. I ordered a size 6 and recieved a size 7 1/4. After some confusion, Ryan, the owner, was very helpful and sent me the correct ring size promptly and at no extra charge. I got married yesterday (Sept. 10th, 2011) and this morning I noticed one of the sapphires is loose. The ring is gorgeous, and this is very upsetting for me. Due to the bar setting, and because I live in a small town it may take weeks for it to get fixed because most jewelers around here need to send this type of work out to bigger cities. Now I am unable to wear my wedding band the day after my wedding. I emailed Diva Diamonds and am awaiting a reply. If you order from them, be sure to VERY CAREFULLY inspect your jewelry upon reciept. As I stated before, I love the ring, although Diva Diamonds needs to pay more attention not only to the orders they are sending out (i.e. sizing) but the quality of their products. I am qute dissapointed with Diva Diamonds.

11904,"This looked so cute online, but it's not as pretty in person. The white spaces are really a sort of dirty cream color. Also, the bottom doesn't really screw on firmly, which makes me worry that it would come off if I tried to wear it. Definitely not worth the money.
",2
11906,"Not what I thought. Doesn't look like anything when received. Difficult attaching the charm to a necklace. Recipient was not thrilled with it.
",2
11912,"The ring is actually a pretty smokey quartz ring, but it was very big. If you had seen, Elizabeth Taylor's pear shaped diamond ring in photographs , that's how big this one is. It was just too much for me. I returned it and ordered one that I hope is at least half the size as this one.
",2
12001,"This is very small & more the size of a charm than a pendant. Not what I was looking for.... I sent it back.

12082,"I bought this item thinking it was very cute . when I got it I wore it for two days and the upper hand of the lizard kept rubbing my piercing. it infected my belly-button very badly. Don`t buy this item unless you are looking to get your piercing infected.
",2
12126,"It was cute for an evening - then the martini glass broke off (under normal usage). I still wear the bar bell without a problem. Three out of the four belly rings bought from Body Candy have broken. All in a very short (1-2 days) timeframe.
",2
12147,"This ring is just beautiful, works very well, but the stone popped out the 2nd time I wore it and I had to superglue it back on.
",2
12181,"As I expected, the garnets of this inexpensive necklace are full of inclusions. I didn't mind, since a garnet is such a deep, dark red. No one would notice unless they held your necklace up to the light. It comes in a nice velvet blue bag.... Here starts my problem.... The second time I took the necklace from the bag, stones and pearls started falling all over the floor. One of the stands had broken. Sigh. Also, I thought the necklace looked cheap compared to the picture. But you might like it. Amazon is wonderful and easy with returns if you don't like it.

12214,"As others have said before, these are huge. Not only this, but the backs are pretty horribly done.I find myself missing both backs after less than a month. How'd they disappear? They fell off while I was sleeping. More than once I found them on my bed, next to me, but there were two times that they just up and disappeared. This is what you call shoddy workmanship.Don't bother with these things, they're a waste of money.
",2
12222,"Beautiful bracelet, I was so hoping it would fit. Unfortunately, it is too small. Can some sort of extension be added so this can be wearable?

12263,"The largest stone fell out of mine shortly after receiving it. It's really cute, but not without all the stones.

12278,"I really like the styling of these earrings, and they're well made, but they weren't very shiny or sparkly. I don't think they're worth the price. I returned them.

12431,"When i saw this bypass toe ring i was really impressed! It looked thick and just what i had been surching for.Well when i got it in the mail i was so disapointed!!! It is very prety but the gold is so thin that it would snap if it got caught one time! That is a real problem for me. I wear my toe rings 247. For that kind of momey i excpect a lot more.
",2
12459,"It is pretty, but rather large. I was going to wear it directly on a choker around my neck, however, I now have to wear it on a very long chain
",2
12484,"I was disappointed in the workmanship, since I had only worn the gold ones for about 4 hours and a portion of the front piece broke off. Haven't tried the pearl ones yet.
",2
12514,"these tiny dice are well made and very unique! They ended up being alot smaller than what we first thought they would be but that ended up being alright. One of them ended up in the top of an ear right above an earcuff on a guys left ear and the other one was small enough to be used as a nose ring it looks very small and feminine not like I would of imagined it but they turned out looking nice where they ended up.
",2
12522,"Let me first say that the delivery was excellent. I got the item earlier than expected. I don't blame the seller at all. However, the problem is that I got what I paid for. The balls are plastic so the metal post easily stripped the grooves where it screws into the ball. There was no way to tighten it. I lost the ball and the ring the 2nd day I was wearing it. However, the one day I had the ring, I loved it. It was pretty that first day.
",2
12531,"The necklace is TINY and the chain is rather delicate. The chain does not appear long enough to fit comfortably around the neck of a normal sized 8 year old (who might like this design). The chain is not sturdy enough to last with a younger child. The ""pink"" tourmaline is rather red and dull looking. The stones in the necklace do *not* match the color of stones in the earrings and ring. Overall, this was a waste of money.
",2
12675,"Earrings look great. Unfortunately, the star fell out of the clasps after one day. Resetting the stone was easy but annoying. This happened with both earrings, so be prepared to do some work yourself if you buy this product.

12705,"Not much to say here, not too crazy about it but it is made of leather.
",2
12718,"It is differnetly not a ring you would want to show off it looks cheap, poorly made and it very light total weight.

12736,"Stud not long enough and it bent when I tried to put in the back in, the price was ok
",2
12744,"I didn't like this only because it looked so strange on. Im fairly fit and thin, it was sticking out so far it looked ridiculous on me. Never worn it after trying it on.

12813,"I bought this unit with the expectation that it would work really well. I followed all the recommended cleaning instructions, and when I cleaned a ring of mine per the directions, it looked as if it was never cleaned. Wiping the ring down with a soft cloth made the ring sparkle more, but I could still see the build-up on the stones and in-between the stones. I am not sure if a good ring cleaner and a small soft brush wouldn't accomplish the same job.
",2
12847,"I didn't find this to do anything more than plain water would have, but I decided it wasn't worth it to return it. So I gave it to my mom, and she seems to like it, which is why I gave it two stars.

12858,"Worked well for about 20 loads at 5 mins each (over the course of a month) then overheated and blew the transformer inside the unit.

12869,"I basically bought this to clean my glasses and my cds, dvds and my son's game disks. It does not do any of these things very well.To get my eyeglasses really clean it takes 4-5 minutes. I can use cleaning solution and a cleaning cloth and do a better job in 30 seconds! Where's the progress in that?? Ditto on cds etc.I was just looking for a quick, easy way to keep my glasses clean without rubbing on the lenses. This isn't it.I've been disappointed before and I'm sure this won't be the last time. Don't waste your money.
",2
12879,"This is an update to my original review below. Jewelry cleaner was wonderful when it worked. Then it died after about 9 months of weekly use. Beware that this product is not durable.----------------This cleaner works wonderfully. I use it for a diamond/platinum engagment ring, a white gold/diamond necklace, a pair of diamond/platinum stud earrings, and a couple watch bands. This cleaner gets all my jewelry looking brand new, and really cleans out the little nooks/crannies that have been impossible to reach with a toothbrush.Recently, I tripped outside and stuck my engagement-ringed hand into some muddy dirt to catch myself. The setting on my engagment ring is full circle of bead-set diamonds, so a ton of little spaces where dirt can hide. The ring band and setting was totally packed and encrusted with dirt. I tried everything - toothbrush, waterpik (several attachments), even the milk steamer on my coffee machine. Nothing got out the trapped black dirt behind the tiny diamonds. Then I bought this cleaner and VOILA! 3 cycles later, it shook out the dirt and restored my ring to pristine condition. SO HAPPY!!IMPORTANT TIPS:1) Water alone isn't enough. It's just common sense that water won't get rid of oily film.2) Use HOT water instead of cold or tepid water. Doesn't need to be boiling, just really warm.3) Use 1-2 capfuls of Mr. Clean or similar cleaning solution(no special jewelry cleaner needed)4) Run several cycles (the most I've needed was 4, for the really, really dirty stuff)Wish the max cycle length went beyond 480 seconds (8 min), but this cleaner couldn't be easier to use, and couldn't clean any better. I love it!

12891,"I love this moonstone and have bought two...one for me and one for my sister. However, when I bought this for my sister it was $40 dollars and when I bought it for myself it was $60! This was in the span of a month that it increased by $20??? I can see if you sold it with the chain but there is no chain. Why the price increase??? I have bought moonstone pendants larger than this for $35 dollars. The price is ridiculous! It would be one thing if it was gold but it's silver. I am not pleased with the price of this and see no reason for the increase in price. It is a nice piece but not worth $60 dollars.
",2
12892,"I ORDERED THE FIRST ONE AND THE STONE WAS UGLY; IT HAD NO RAINBOW. IT WAS ALL MILKY OPAGUE. SO I THOUGHT I JUST GOT A BAD ONE AND I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE, AND WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS JUST AS BAD AS THE FIRST, SO I SENT THEM BOTH BACK. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. MAYBE THEY CAN'T GET A DECENT STONE IN THAT SIZE.
",2
12924,"I bought this product thinking it would be good. First of all the size wasn't even right. I already had a size 9 ring and this one looked like a 6 or a 7. Second of all, it feels like plastic because its extremely light. Its made of titanium but it's very light.
",2
12987,"I received my polishing cloth in less than a week which was great. However after me using the cloth a few times the cloth would no longer clean my silver jewelry. So if you are looking for a cleaning cloth to last for a long while this would not be for you. I would not buy this product again.
",2
13031,"When i purchased this along with the matching necklace, the company sent me an email saying that they had a tarnished bracelet and they wouldn't send it to me so i had the option to wait for a new one or to cancel the order. So i chose to wait and to be honest they sent it right away and gave me back the shipping money. But the bracelet is not as shiny as the necklace at all. It's as if it's made of stainless steel not silver plated. I don't know if this is the tarnished bracelet they were talking about in their email because i have nothing to compare it to except the necklace. It's not like the picture.
",2
13054,"I loved the ring. It's beautiful, but after wearing it for only a few hours I got a nice green ring around my finger...making me feel like it's not really sterling silver. I'd hesitate to buy again.
",2
13055,"I recived the ring with no problems, but was disappionted with the actual size of the Knot emblem. Would have liked it a bit bigger.
",2
13073,"these were pretty and that's why i chose them, but they're pretty heavy and don't hang well on the ear. they also were shipped missing a back.
",2
13076,"The overall impressions of other reviewers seemed to be that the quality of this product was better than the cost would indicate. I have to disagree. The silver beads are of a similar or lower quality than those found in any old bead shop. The ruby beads are very milky and have little character. The feel in the hand is stiff and cheap. Overall, it feels like a $5 piece of junk store jewelry.
",2
13110,"This bracelet did indeed have beautiful color, but the one I received had some white stones that I wasn't expecting. If they had been spread around more I might have accepted it as a red and white bracelet which would have been cool, but they weren't, so I returned it.
",2
13112,"This ring is hollowed out, and therefore not as comfortable as a ring that isn't. I only wore it a few times and gave it to charity.
",2
13122,"These earrings are purple, not even close to the pink pictured. For the price, I gave them to my neighbor's daughter instead of returning them, Cute, but not pink.
",2
13126,"I ordered these along with ""Curley Cue Twisted Spiral Sterling Silver Hook Earrings"" from Silver Insanity. I am not sure if they are the ones who manufacture these or if they buy them from somewhere else for resale, but they are VERY flimsy and were not symmetrical at all. When I started to bend them to symmetry, it was evident that any new bend was going to be irreversible and permanently kink the metal. I thought they looked very cool with a hint of sci-fi, but they looked awkward when I tried them on. It reminded me of misshapen paperclips with a silver BB glued at the end. I ended up returning them. They are an interesting pair of earrings, but be prepared to get exactly what you see in the picture -- they don't line up. That's only noticeable as the wearer; other people who see you wearing them will most compliment them. There were no problems at all in getting my refund.
",2
13147,"whom ever is selling this item its in other Jewelery stores like Crown Jewelers. I have a lot of Jewelers at good price and sometime your have too search stores too find the best price for what your looking for.
",2
13174,"I received this item as a birthday gift after adding it to my wishlist. It is a beautiful pendant, but it's the tiniest piece of Tanzanite I have ever seen! It almost looks like it was meant as a child's necklace. You would be better off going to a jewelry store to purchase a similar item, so you can at least see the actual size. I have several other pieces of Tanzanite jewelry and based on what they cost, for the price of this item, you could easily find a much larger piece.
",2
13176,"seems of cheap quality and doesnt look very niceNot exactly a high quality necklace, but guess you get what you pay for?
",2
13204,"I get that the description says ""amber"", and it is not usually red,so the earrings I received are of a light orange color, a bit dispointed, because I would have loved it to be more cherry amber.and also, the shape of the earrings is not as shown on the picture, it's more a simple oval shapenot bad, but not as expected
",2
13335,"in the picture they are very impresive but in reallity nothing to talk about but i live overseas so i cannot return anything so i will be left with themruthi
",2
13346,"Well you get what you pay for. Extremely light weight links are cheap, clasp the same broke first day. Looks very nice, however smaller then thought and the paws are hollow. Just no quality. Worth $12.00 at most. I'm half Native American and so is the wife and we both love the looks but that's as far as it go's. As part Native american I'm embarssed.
",2
13378,"The necklace is a lot shorter than I imagined--it's literally half an inch away from being a choker. The pendant is not in proportion and much much larger. I was looking for a cheap Valentines day gift for my gf, but this is just too childish.
",2
13386,"Having bought the pear shaped earrings I thought this pendant would be a great complement to it but was disapponinted with the size of the stone as it was much smaller than presented.
",2
13409,"This was embarrassingly small. I thought I knew what half of a half-carat looked like, but the picture of this product made the earrings look bigger than they turned out to be be. Makes my wife's 1-carat ring look absolutely HUGE in comparison. I told her that I'd thoroughly understand if she never put them on. Goes to show ya -- you get what you pay for. I shoulda known. It'd be much cheaper to buy earrings with cut glass, and nobody cold tell the difference.
",2
13444,"This necklace is not what you may expect, after going to some Swarovski stores you can tell it has ""other"" quality, maybe crystals come from Swarovski but the necklace is not similar to original ones, maybe it is a good gift for the price, but be sure what you want before order it.
",2
13446,"Looks better in picture then in reality. The crystal looks more like plastic then glass. A cheap trinket. Not sure what is made with Swarovski Element in this one
",2
13466,"A present for my wife, she complained they were too large for the holes in her ears, but kept them.
",2
13474,"This is a pretty bracelet, but it's very narrow. Even on my 6"" wrist it looked small. It would be ok for a child.
",2
13486,"The picture looks better than the product. There are only 5 sides. The sides are not even square, being about 4mm x 5mm. On regulation dice, the sum of opposite sides is supposed to be ""7"", but the 5 is opposite the 3 and the 4 is opposite the 2. The 6 is opposite nothing, as the ""1"" side is open. The presentation was very nice, a velvet drawstring bag within a gift box. With the cost of gold being what it is, this probably the best they can do for the price. Maybe you should buy a magnifier to go with it.
",2
13508,"Having read the other reviews I expected something small, but decent. The particular pair I received had two defects: 1. one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2. one of the stones had a very large, visible black inclusion near the top. It was visible to my naked eye (I don't have a jeweler's loupe) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but given those two problems and the small size of the stones, I sent them back and did not try again.
",2
13515,"much smaller than appear... it may have been a lack of attention payed to the cttw, but it may also have been that the total weight was the two together and not each one separately.
",2
13519,"These are a joke. They are barely big enough to see and look more like a gag gift than real.
",2
13525,"It's not that I'd expect a whole lot from a $99 dollar pair of diamond studs. But honestly, these are sooooo small about 2mm or less each that you can't tell it's diamond at all. They kind of look like metal posts. There's no room for it to even sparkle. After buying these, I went to Macy's and picked up a fake pair of studs that were bigger and they look a lot more like real diamonds than these. You'd do better to save up and get bigger diamonds or just buy the fakes!
",2
13526,"I ordered these as a gift. Purchased a similar pair for myself, recently and was pleased with quality, but this pair had problems. Had to reorder TWICE (thank you Amazon!), but FINALLY got an acceptable pair, just in time. I disagree with the I1-I2 rating these have. I have purchased diamonds before and knew these were not ""top quality"", but the ones I received seemed far below any I1-I2 rated diamonds I've bought in the past. It seemed to always be a problem with one earring. Perhaps, Amazon could make sure these were better matched, as a pair. Also, these had noticeable scratches and divots on the face or table, which is the most visible part on a solitaire diamond. $100 is a lot of money for lesser quality diamonds. Setting and backs were fine. In the end, all is well; but I'm not sure I would order these again.
",2
13541,"The ring I received was finely polished,and looked exactly like the one in the picture......except for the stone. The stone looksabsolutely NOTHING like the stone displayed.Where that one in the picture was a dark blue,I received a ring that had more of a baby blue stonewith a black strain through it.I was very disappointed.
",2
13547,"I thought it was bigger than what I saw in it's description. I bought it under that impression. When I received it, it was the size of a dime. I bought it for my boyfriend's chain, and it looked microscopic on him... so embarassing.... :0(
",2
13564,"Did receive this product on second order. The band is not nearly as wide as it appears on the image. It is slightly wider than the football shown.
",2
13589,"They work fine as fasteners, are decent looking (if plain) and are pretty cheap, but not very durable. The black face of one of the studs fell off after two uses, leaving only the silver body. The other studs and cufflinks have held up fine, but it's still annoying.I guess I shouldn't have expected more given the price, but I wouldn't recommend these. Spring a little extra for a set that is more durable and can be used longer.
",2
13606,"This is a nice toe ring, but even though I have size 10-11 feet, it is too big and slips round, so the 'knot' is underneath, and if you go swimming with it on it will always come off - so not ideal for wearing and useage.
",2
13635,"The ring looks fine online but was so surprisingly small once we received it. A point of reference shot would have helped avoid this problem. I suggest looking at at least .5 cttw, it is not much more and it looks so much better.
",2
13642,"It's pretty, but the clasp isn't staying that well on mine. I'm not in love with it, but it is pretty.
",2
13653,"Super quick delivery but as far as it 'looking real' uhhh - no... I do however like the bracelet, just don't purchase thinking you will fool anyone into thinking it's gold and diamonds.
",2
13655,"I bought this Bracelet for my wife she wore it one day and it broke at the clasp. Not very good quality. I would like to say though I sent it back and requisted a refund and was very satified that the company refunded my money no questions ask. I thank then for that.
",2
13707,"These are pretty, but very small- which is to be expected when you look at the measurement on the photo. But somehow I missed that when I originally decided to buy them. So that's my fault. What is not my fault is that the seller took 5 days from the time I ordered to process and finally ship them! The same day I bought these, I also bought 2 other items from different sellers. Those items both came before this one even shipped, and they were all shipped using standard shipping. That tells me that this seller is not up to par with the others. In any case, it should not take 5 days to process an order unless it is in a separate warehouse or on backorder. If that's the case, they never notified me I'd have to wait. Unfortunately for me, I suspect the items will still get here within the approximated time, so I won't be able to file a claim. This review doesn't have much at all to do with the product- it's the seller and their slow processing time. Even if the item still gets here ""on time"" it's the principal of the thing. You shouldn't order something and have to wait 5 days before they tell you it's finally shipping out- the item should already be there! Anyways, I still like Amazon, but it seems to be hit or miss with their marketplace stores!
",2
13709,"The CZ does not sparkle at all, I doubt it is even CZ at all. It looks like gumball plastic. One of the hoops broke about a week after wearing them. Shame because I liked the hidden lock. The design seemed good enough to be considered contemporary not cheesy but oh well.
",2
13723,"I liked the earrings, looks good, but too easy to fall off an earring clasp is not tight, very bad, and the other fortunately
",2
13736,"I have had these for about a month. Worn about three times and the backings have bent to the point where it is now difficult to put them on. I have had many compliments about them and they are comfortable and nice looking, but I just don't think they will last long. I will only wear them on occassion at this point becasue I don't think they would last a whole week of use. Disappointed, but keeping them until I can afford the real thing.
",2
13738,"The earrings are okay in finishing and craftsmanship, but the hook is not secure. I am going to lose one of them soon certainly and because of this I end up not wearing them often.
",2
13754,"I was shocked when I received these earrings. They are quite small -- more for a child than an adult. All in all, they are beautiful and my husband thought they were real! The price is right!
",2
13758,"On this almost 9$ pair of earrings SecureHoop charged me 30$ for shipping! That is outragious!
",2
13761,"These came as described, and were great... For a few weeks. I used them for daily wear. Before long, the earrings would not stay clasped and the posts bent. Not worth the price, or the wait.
",2
13773,"I purchased this ring as a gift for my husband (who works on the ocean). The design is wonderful and unique. However, we have purchased (and wear) numerous items made of pure sterling silver and know that they do not turn your fingers green or tarnish. This item made a green ring around his finger within hours of putting it on. Within a couple days it was already turning gray/brown on the inside from tarnishing. It is NOT pure silver and should not be sold/described as such. It is a cheap piece of jewelry. Unfortunate, because the concept and design are very charming.
",2
13777,"Looked nice in picture. Looked nice out of bag, less then 10 minutes later onyx fell off. Sure it would have been nice if it had lasted. Had to run out and buy niece something at last minute to replace this. Risky product
",2
13790,"The locket doesn't close and the stone falls out. Very disapointed in it. If it worked correctly then it would be a cute piece to wear, but I'll have to solder it shut if I want to wear it. Blah.
",2
13810,"The pendandt, although very beautiful, was smaller than I had expected. The photo made it appear so much larger. But the main issue that I had with the piece, was that the pendant spune too freely. It would never lay flat on either the denim lapis side, or the onyx side. I haven't hardly worn it for that reason.
",2
13823,"I thought based on the description that it was a charm bracelet. Well, I thought wrong. It was just the charm.
",2
13841,"I purchased two rings expecting them to be identical but they weren't. One was smaller in width than the other. Shipping was not fast it took a week just to receive them in the mail. Have to say I was dissatisfied with the result.
",2
13859,"Was excited to get these in the mail in time for St. Patty's day. Went to put them on and one of them snapped off of the clasp. Only reason that I am giving the 2nd star is because the return/refund process was so smooth.
",2
13862,"I was disappointed when I received this in the mail as it was way more pretty in the picture. The color of the stone is way off, I found it very dark, and the chain was very low quality.
",2
13868,"I got this pendant for my mom for mother's day and was surprised at the low quality. It looks like something you can get at Walmart for $10.00. The chain is cute, but I would not buy from this dealer again.
",2
13872,"The bracelet shows as white, but came in yellow. One of the charms is different too. It's a cute bracelet, but the description should advise the difference.
",2
13880,"The price is good. But the size is not close to what has described. It is much smaller. It looks and feels 14K gold. But it is thin as a sheet metal. I don't need the fancy jewelry boxes for this kind of pendant. I guess that's where the money went.
",2
13887,"the necklace itself is great. The clasp that it comes with is another story. The clasp came apart twice the first week we had it. It was very thin and fragile. I ended up taking it to a jeweler and having a lobster claw clasp put on it so it wouldn't fall off and get lost
",2
13890,"A little disappointed as ring has a lot of nicks & rough looking. The onyx looks more dark blue than black.You can tell it's not an expensive ring.
",2
13895,"I was disappointed because they broke! One of the posts broke away from the base and now I can't wear them.
",2
13902,"Although I very much like the LOOK of the ring, unfortunately in less than a week, the ring began to lose its shape because of the gap between the heads. Definitely not a ring that can be warn constantly and one that is easily lost or broken. Boo.
",2
13916,"This is a lovely locket. It's the perfect size and shape, and people admire it for its attractiveness. Unfortunately, it doesn't close very well. There's a gap between the two sides of the locket when it's closed, and it doesn't ""click"" shut the way a normal locket would. It will occasionally open on its own. I've tried manipulating the metal piece that should allow it to stay shut, but it hasn't really been helping.

13926,"We ordered this along with the ""Womens 4 MM Wide Rhodium Plated .925 Sterling Silver Band Cubic Zirconia Ring"" as temporary commitment bands. I have to say that her's is holding up a lot better. With a band this wide, scuffs and scratches stick out. It will due for now until we buy the ""real"" ones. I wouldn't buy this for actual weddings though. You get what you pay for.

13933,"Tends to slide on the tie a little. Tie clasp came apart after removing it from tie the first time. Is it worth returning? Will attempt to fix it ourselves. Disappointed. Cheap.

13942,"I purchased these links to extend my Tiffany necklaces. They were cheap and embarassing from the back, and although my hair hides it initially, when they came around to the front, it was very ugly. One of the clasps only lasted one outing, and I almost lost the pendant when the clasp failed!
",2
13957,"Overall they are cute. But A LOT smaller than anticipated. And the metal on one was a bit bent.
",2
13978,"It's beautiful and I get many people tell me how pretty it is, but after you wear it a couple of weeks, it leaves a black mark around your finger that doesn't wash completely off for several days.
",2
14027,"The earings themselves look nice but if you are buying them because of the diamonds then don't waste your time. You will be sending them back like I did.The diamonds have absolutely no sparkle, even in the direct sun. The only reason why I buy things with diamonds is because they sparkle, these don't, they look like someone forget to put in the batteries.
",2
14030,"I know it said it would probably differ slightly from the picture, but the color seems more on the flat side to me. The main stones cut also seems a little sloppy(but I am a perfectionst!) Either way, it's not bad for the price... and I will still be giving it as a gift along with a few other things. Mabey it doesnt seem so great because I ordered the teardrop moonstone pendant along with it and THAT is really nice!
",2
14032,"I bought this fairy bracelet because my niece loves Tinkerbell. I loved the fact that the fairy has a kind of stone on the wings. So I bought one of each, a fairy with red wings, green, blue, well you get the idea. I regret buying them because the actual bracelet feels and looks like stainless steel instead of having a silver look. It reminds me of something that you can buy at a hardware store. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Bottom line- cute concept but poorly made.
",2
14055,"It is very pretty but the first day i wore it the large cz fell out..
",2
14067,"Cute little guy, but the ""pink rose quartz"" pendant is more white than pink. The photo is misleading. This was a gift for a friend; if we'd had more time we'd have returned it and asked for a different, brighter color.

14124,"I expected to recieve 2 frogs and only got 1. What happened to the other one? It is cute but toooooooooooooooooo little.
",2
14134,"I ordered this, thinking i would recieve a pair of stud 2mm earrings. instead, i got one 3mm earring on a black piece of cardboard that stated, ""lone stud."" I contacted the seller and they informed me that while normally we would ""percieve"" that i was purchasing a pair, i had actually purchased only one stud. so, spending another seven dollars, i purchased a second one. this one came as a PAIR of 2mm stud earrings! I mean, what???? Luckily, I have my nose pierced so i won't go through the hassle of returning the first stud, but I'd just like to let you know that my experience with this purchase was odd. In addition, neither the pair nor the ""lone stud"" truly resemble the picture shown. However, i believe them to actually look better than the picture, which is why i gave this product two stars instead of one.
",2
14208,"I was disappointed with the Blue Topaz necklace. It feels flimzy and doesn't look nearly as nice as the picture. I will be sending it back.
",2
14216,"I bought this pendant as a gift for my daughter. Pendant was received in a timely manner. Very pretty but crystal fell out within weeks.
",2
14236,"This thing was much too small to be used as a septum retainer, it is 8g x 1/4""!!! my septum is wider than 1/4""! I couldn't use it but the company was quick to offer a replacement or refund.
",2
14240,"Overall these are disappointing. First, the length is smaller than advertised, under 1 3/16 inches, that is about 30mm, as compared to the advertised 35 mm in the product specifications table. More importantly, unlike the photo, the ""blue"" topaz is so pale as to look white rather than blue. The result is that the stone blends in so completely with the silver that it is essentially invisible except under very close up examination. In fact, at first I thought there was no stone at all.On the plus side, they are fairly sturdy and feel like good quality, but I shall have to make an emergency trip to the mall for a different gift.
",2
14245,"This bracelet has a good artisan's touch but the peridots are hard to see under inside lighting. The color of the stones are much darker than is shown in amazon's picture. It is a decent silver piece for a teenager and can probably be found alot cheaper at a local arts fair.
",2
14264,"I wasn't real happy when i got the 2 braclets and there are no instructions and no clasps/esplainations on how to close it.
",2
14358,"I personally rarely spend much money on jewelry. I thought this item looked like a fun finger toy to have, so I bought it. I don't regret buying it, but I wouldn't buy again. It is fun to spin, but doesn't spin very well. Soap gets caught into it, and it is such a hassle to clean! Buy this if you have a lot of money in your pockets and you want to waste it.
",2
14359,"The rings look absolutely awesome. Unfortunately they don't like my skin. They bleed out on my skin. Because of that I can't give them a great score.
",2
14398,"Beads popped out of silver frame several days after I bought this.
",2
14406,"This was delivered very quickly but was much smaller and delicate than I expected. The clasp is very difficult to get on and off because it's very tiny. Maybe better for a child than an adult if you change the chain.
",2
14413,"Very disappointed, tie tack is very small compared to picture that is shown . Expected it to be larger the price was a little steep but it was purchased for my teenage son who loves eagles. would not order from this company again
",2
14425,"A word of warning. Totally don't get this if your girlfriend's or wife's name begins with a letter other than ""C."" And if you do accidentally get it, and she gets mad, don't shrug your shoulders and say, ""eh, close enough."" It's just not a good idea.
",2
14428,"I wish that the Bunco charm had more on it. I wanted dice or something. This was the only one I could find. The charm itself is nice and is well constructed but doesn't sparkle.
",2
14449,"I received the product in good time, but after 2 days, it broke. I sent it back to the company and now almost 2 months later, I haven't heard from them or received my bracelet back.
",2
14520,"I LOVE the idea of this bracelet but this is the second one I've ordered, only for it to break the second day I had it on (again). I recommend finding another company who makes a similar product as this one is just terribly quality.
",2
14704,"The patterns were not as ""fashion forward"" as I would have hoped them to be.
",2
14714,"The pendant is nice; however, it's not nearly the color in the advertized photo. It's more yellowish in color. I would prefer the darker shade, since the features in the jasper seem to stand out more clearly. I was pleasantly surprised that a chain came with it. I've worn it almost incessantly since receiving it. It's a good deal for the price!
",2
14766,"these earrings are definetly not as thick/hardy as they appear in the picture. they look very thin and fragile in real life, like they will bend easily... not exactly what i was looking for
",2
14780,"these are cute but they are huge! the earrings are attached in a way so that the cheese faces in a weird direction so i had to bend them to not stick out so far.
",2
14801,"When I purchased this ring I read the reviews.The picture looks better than when you actually see it for yourself.I have this ring for over 2months now and the black is coming off.I have not recieved any comments on my ring from anyone and to me it looks plastic.Now it looks plastic to me but its not.I would say for a woman noway and for a man,maybe.The main flaw is like I said the black finish is already coming off.
",2
14805,"The satin finish wore of after I wore it a few times. should of taken it off when I worked around the house. It got chipped up pretty bad, not very durable.
",2
14811,"way larger than you would expect. looks ok. broke up with the girl so im glad i got her a half ass cheap feeling and looking necklass. LATE
",2
14842,"I did not like this necklace. The crystal beads are tiny and they are scratchy. I would not recommend it. It is not worth the money.
",2
14855,"even though measurements are posted in product information, I was still surprised at how small the earrings were. Nice, but appropriate for a child.
",2
14900,"I love the actually pendent the time it got there was great. But I really didn't like how they show the pendent on a chain because I bought it for the whole package (chain included). So when I got it I was SHOCKED that it didn't included it. So buyers beware this supplier doesn't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra $15-$30 even thou they adversities it in their ad.
",2
14901,"I bought this item for my soon to be hubby it was so small i could have just threw it in the trash.

",2
15002,"I wanted a fake piercing just to see if I would like the look of a real one without having to risk infections and stuff pertaining to having a hole in the flesh.It's cute but just not realistic due to the wire jutting out of the rose. Which sucks because that's what I was going for.However, I decided to get a real piercing, not because of the look of this product, but because of the look of a tiny metallic golden dot sticker that I took from my little cousin. Wish that I've done that sooner...
",2
15004,"Review of axe nose ring: Overall I did not like this product.Pros:Made of silver as advertised.shipped promptly by vendor.Good detail, and antique finish.Cons:Weak construction, lost unit because it would not hold its shape.Cuff and bead finish very rough, very hard on the inside of nose.Stem needs to be longer and extend up the back side of the unit to the axe head.Bead needs to be mounted the other way to help secure it when adjusted. Stem needs to be heavier with better attachement to axe, this is where it broke.
",2
15025,"I did not like the way the earings looked on me, they were of good quality. It is so difficult to find clip earings...
",2
15101,"This ring looks gorgeous but because it sticks up it gets caught on everything. It is not worth the problems of wearing it. If you are someone who doesn't do anything or doesn't have to reach into a pocket book for anything you will be fine. Like I said looks great but cumbersome to wear.
",2
15124,"Earrings were a disappointment. They seem cheap considering the price and very small, not impressive at all.
",2
15184,"I purchased this item and it was as beautiful as it looked in online when I received it. However after a week of wearing it the dragonfly fell off somewhere so there was not point in wearing it anymore. It was great for the price, but I was disappointed that I was unable to enjoy it very long.
",2
15293,"I purchased this product through Amazon several weeks ago, and was very disappointed when it arrived. It is much lighter in color and weight than I expected. A nice necklace for a teenager but not bold enough for an adult. I have returned it for a full refund.
",2
15301,"I really liked these earrings when I first got them. With each wear, though, the finish comes off a little more and silver just disappears, leaving chunks of just clear plastic intermixed with the silver color. They're very cute for the first few wears, but be aware they won't stay new-looking for long.
",2
15328,"This necklace may be genuine amber, but the chips are very small. The picture shown is larger than the actual necklace.
",2
15331,"The picture appears to show a true 3-dimensional charm. If you flip it over you find that it is a ""pressing"" or hollowed out charm that only looks like a pelican on one side. That means that if it flips over while you are wearing it you are looking at scooped out silver and not a pelican. On the plus side it does come with a very fine chain that looks about 18 inches long.
",2
15347,"The stones are not as bright as the pic. Purchase at your own risk !!!!
",2
15361,"Titanium alloys are relatively CHEAP; they are certainly nowhere close to being considered even semi-precious as a base material. They're typically easy to machine and work with, which only compounds the problem I have with the pricing, even if the price of entry is far below that of gold or platinum.Yes titanium is durable. Yes titanium wears well. Yes titanium is hypo-allergenic. Yes it's cheaper than gold. But in the end it's still just titanium, a bloody well common metal in pure form and nearly equally just as so in all of its alloy forms. Considering how simple this band is, it's not much of a step away from costume jewelry, regardless of how stylish or spiffy it looks. An equal amount of this metal in an airplane wing would be equate to pennies; am I supposed to be impressed that some cheap labor (or even a machine or two) who knows where spitting these out by the thousands makes it worth a cool $100?I think not.(Evidently some of the sellers also think as me, since it's now $30 cheaper than it was four months ago when I first wrote this rant. But considering the prices of some of the other titanium bands here on Amazon, $70 is still on the steep side.)
",2
15367,"I'm a bit on the fence about it. On the one hand it looks pretty cool and the black fits my personal style well. On the other hand, that black scratches off way too easy! After only a month, I noticed a couple scratches where the black was scratched off. After a couple months, there are many scratches. For the price, I did not expect to have the black scratch off like this. Maybe I am too rough? If the black scratches completely off, I will have to get another ring. It's a bit disappointing.
",2
15375,"this ring is so ugly, and huge, but its ok for your daughter on holloween or something if she is going to be a princess or something. i wouldnt wear it in public.
",2
15398,"my son bought this for his girlfriend for Christmas. It's very pretty but the chain is very frail and didnt last. Ended up having to buy a new chain.
",2
15400,"I just received my earrings and am not happy. They look like miniature versions of what I see on the screen, and I don't see any dimensions published (now I know why). I will send these back (if the shipping isn't more than the cost!).
",2
15433,"First off I would like to say that I LOVE Silver Insanity items and have bought things from them numerous times. They are a good company with quality items, but this item is not one of their best. I think they should just take it out of their inventory. I'm sad to say that this item looks much better in the picture than in real life. The metal is of poor quality, not like their usual silver products, The globe itself actually looks really cheap and ugly. I'm thinking that maybe if I found a round stone to fit inside and glued the lock shut then it might work, depending on if I can get the metal shined up to standard. Right now it's been sitting in my jewelry box for over a year and I have never actually worn it yet. Also the lock mechanism on it doesn't stay closed all the time.
",2
15435,"The picture online was so beautiful. To me it reminded me of the Cat collar, ""Orion's Belt"" from the first Men In Black movie. Not that big of a MIB fan, although I was interested in a necklace look-a-like I searched online and stumbled across this pendant.When I finally got it I was severely disappointed. The cage that was supposed to ""open"" Was stuck and I broke a nail attempting to open it. It's about the size of a quarter and doesn't even come with a chain.The small hole where the chain goes through is about the size of a needle head. Most of my chains wouldn't fit and the ones that did were too delicate for this half pound paper weight.The globe itself is very beautiful but the thick fake gold gridlines running through the entire globe ruin the effect.I wasn't SEVERELY disappointed but then again I didn't think I would pay nearly $40 for something the size of a bottle cap.
",2
15436,"The earth is very unclear and the holder rough looking. I was expecting a more fine piece of jewelry.
",2
15439,"I have only had this piece for two days. I received it as a gift. I no longer have it. The lock on the cage opened at some point and the globe is now gone. I loved this piece. It has been on my wish list for two years. I am terribly dissapointed, and will be contacting the seller to request a refund, or a replacement of the globe. I had contemplated wireing it shut... had i been able to find the globe.
",2
15447,"I bought this necklace for my wife and she loves it. The globe inside is a deep blue, and the continents are made up of different stones. The quality of the chain seems good, and the globe is not too bulky, so she can wear it comfortably without feeling like there is a giant ball hanging around her neck. The bad thing about this item is the lock that keeps the stone globe inside the case. It is just a little tab that clicks into a hole, but either the tab is not big enough or the hole is not deep enough. We have had the globe pop out five times now. Luckily it's been in the mall or while we were walking through a parking lot, so we were able to retrieve the globe every time. My wife is scared to wear it out of the house now, so it is just sitting on the dresser until we figure out how to rig the lock to make it hold better.
",2
15453,"Although I was pleased with the overall appearance of this pendant, after opening the world cage the clip fastener refused to re-fasten properly. It cannot be worn with confidence. Too bad!
",2
15556,"I was really disappointed with the color of the ""ruby"" stones! I knew they would be a little light for this price, but the ones I received look more like Pink Tourmaline than rubies!! Very disappointed...
",2
15557,"I bought this earing to gift it to my Sister-in-law... Its cute but it doest sparkle as shown in the picture..In the picture the stone s are very dark in color but the one i got is not as bright as i expected to be... The design is nice..
",2
15573,"I really liked these earrings, but both were lost when the leverbacks stopped locking in place after just a couple months of use.
",2
15584,"I was so disappointed with these earrings that I am returning them. I always figure that the picture has been enlarged, but these are miniscule! You can't even tell what the design is.
",2
15627,"I received the pendant today. Was not happy with what I got at all. The one in the picture shows markings around the circle. The one sent was just plain..... This is a present for my daughter am so glad it came here first and not to her.
",2
15731,"I dont know about you, but I have NEVER had a Sterling Silver ring turn my finger green. so I am not even sure if they are really sterling silver. I will not be buying any of these rings again.
",2
15762,"It's okay if you're only going to use it once or twice. The downside is that the cap turned rusty and fell off, breaking the chain....
",2
15768,"I'm sorry to say this ring looks better in the picture than in person. The gold tone is too bright and wore off quickly. It has a light weight to it.

15793,"The ring looked exactly as it did in the picture. But for Sterling Silver - I didn't expect that it would turn my boyfriend's finger green.
",2
15803,"This wrap bracelet was not as expected. It is unique, kind of pretty and sytlish but i did not like the quality once it was received and I would not wear it..
",2
15812,"I like the product, the stays are good, I like the finish of the product. The problem (and the reason why I'm rating it low), is that I didn't get 3 sizes, I got two pairs of the largest stays and one pair of the medium size, but no small size, and that is actually the size I use the most!Unfortunately I didn't realize of that problem until I was no longer in the States so I cannot return them now...
",2
15823,"The packaging id berree than the &iacute;tems. They are ok but I expected a little more quality. I wouldn't recommend this, maybe try the plastic options
",2
15856,"Nice wallet but the lining ripped after 2 days of use. The slots are good size for credit cards. They need to use thicker material for lining.
",2
15900,"I ordered this ring with three expectations - one, that it would fit, two, that the band looked like the photo, and three, that the stone would be a half-carat size as advertised. While I did get it in record time - it was even delivered in two days ON Christmas Day! - I found that it did not fit my expectations on any count.First - I ordered the same size 7 I wear every day (and have many rings in this size that DO fit) and it was noticeably too small.Second - the band does not look like this at all. I got a knife-edge band, with a sharp ridge running across the upper edge of the band, which I don't care for at all. It's probably the mounting style I like the least of all.Third - The stone is definitely bigger than a half-carat - probably closer to a full carat. I don't have my calipers handy, but when compared with some half-carat sized stones I already own, it is significantly larger. I wanted the smaller size stone it was supposed to be.The stone also fits so far down inside the mounting that the culet (bottom point of the stone) hits the bottom of the prong set mount, and that blocks light from coming up through the bottom, cutting way down on the sparkle.Unfortunately, it's going back for a refund.
",2
15965,"item is very cheap. i have never seen a sterling silver ring that turned dull in a couple of days.
",2
15979,"I ordered two of these rings in January to wear on both sides of my diamond. I was very pleased with these rings until one of them came apart where the ring was joined. I am very disappointed that this happened. The rings are beautiful but I can not wear one of them because it now pinches my skin. Maybe I just received a bad ring.
",2
16007,"This is as small as the smallest keyring wire I've ever seen. My niece wanted it for Christmas. It was on her wish list, but I'm embarrassed to give it to her.
",2
16028,"Beautiful ring setting, but didn't like the stones, particularly the blue one. It was too flat on top and looked like plastic. Too bad, because the setting is first class. Hated to send it back, but couldn't live with the stone.
",2
16029,"This is clearly not a sapphire, but the picture makes it seem much bluer. The stone is violet, not dark blue. The ring itself is lovely, has very nice milgrain working all over, but the side stones are nicer than the center stone.
",2
16055,"I thought these earrings were cute and still do, as they are pictured. However, the pair I received (Dec 2009) had a chain that was twice as long as it should be. The earrings didn't look right. I contacted the seller and they offered to replace it, but, the cost of sending it back was as much as the earrings, so it wasn't worth it. Hope yours looks like the picture.
",2
16057,"I was a little disappointed as the picture showed a very dainty elegant earring but when I receive it, it did not look either elegant or dainty. The wires are very very thin and the chain with the ball is quite longer than shown which just makes it look less attractive.The balls have a tendency to get tangled in the wires with normal movement. I kept them but I wasn't thrilled with them. Haven't gotten any comments either.
",2
16060,"I have to say I was very dissapointed in these earings. They are very pretty, however the hook of the earing is so cheap whatever comes in contact with it will bend it. It seems to be such a soft material that it Cannot hold its shape. The earings are useless to me now. I can""t even try to get them back into shape, thats how bad they are misshaped.
",2
16068,"Beautiful, but way too dainty and fragile. One of them broke when I took it out of the packaging and I never got to wear these earrings.
",2
16069,"These earings are fine, are cheap, but the picture make you think that they are a quite bigger than they are.
",2
16078,"Beautiful piece, had to search for it in the box, it did not appear to even be there. Wife wore it all of 12 days before the ring that attaches the pendant to the chain opened up and pendant fell off. If all you are going to do is look at it then it is worth the price, if the intention was to actually wear it, then put a safety chain around it too.
",2
16144,"I received this item as a Christmas gift after putting it on my wish list. I'm very disappointed because the colors are so light. Online the colors look fairly rich but in person they are almost nonexistent. Definitely not worth the money.
",2
16237,"When i received my earrings in the mail i was not so excited as when I saw these compared to when I saw it on the web. They are good quality and cute sparkly earrings but they are definitely not genuine swarovski crystals. more like glass.
",2
16238,"I thought these were going to be made of stone. These feel and look like plastic beads. I wish I had spent my money on something nicer from a craft fair.
",2
16239,"These looked great in the picture, but when I got them I was disappointed. There's not as sparkly and bright as I had thought they would be. They just look like plastic beads on a wire. The return policy from the store I bought them from was such that it would have cost too much in postage and fees to make it worth returning.
",2
16240,"I only wore mine for 2 hours, the crystals fell off on both earrings! I love the colors and the length, too bad the quality isn't as good.
",2
16241,"These earrings seemed gorgeous in the photo, but when I got them in the mail they looked cheap - and not much like the picture. They don't dangle the way they seemed to in the photo, either. They're small plastic beads on a wire. I got them as a gift, but didn't give them to the person they were intended for - I plan to give them to my 14 yr old niece for her birthday, instead. They're more suited to a pre-teen/teenager than a woman.
",2
16247,"the picture makes the earrings look more brilliant and bigger than they actually are. They are a gift but i am disappointed.
",2
16263,"Hi,I bought this for a present, but the metal pieces came al rusted and worn out. Crystals are amazing, but what was supposed to be Silver is all dark. I cannot give it as a present looking like this.. I know Silver might get dark IN TIME, if it's in contact with skin, due to body grease and dust but not out of the box.I uploaded an image about this.It's not the first time I buy stuff from this guys, but seems to be like a lottery, hoping your product to come as described.thx.
",2
16295,"I realize that these are not expensive jewelry, but I have earrings that I've paid less for that look much better. I was disappointed with these. I love the colors, as I wear a lot of black and thought these looked great online. Simply put, they just look cheap. Even the silver leverback looks & feels cheap. Very disappointed.
",2
16296,"These earrings are really pretty which is why I didn't give them only 1 star. They are however completely falsely represented in the sense that the description is a flat out LIE! The beads are not Swarovski crystal, they are merely sparkly beads that you can buy at a hobby shop. I've seen the exact same beads at Hobby Lobby and they are an inexpensive synthetic crystal (I make jewelry in my spare time and I could make these for less than $5 a pair, so you guys are being ripped off). I'm really upset that these are total fakes and from now on I will only buy swarovski crystal jewelry from certified swarovski dealers and never on Amazon again.
",2
16369,"Charm looks much better in the picture, of course I understand that it's much smaller in person. The quality is not that great, unlike the description. I've seen much better in the stores!! I will not return it because the shipping will cost me more than the charm is worth. Too bad for me, I've learned my lesson! Thanks anyway - my fault!
",2
16371,"I received the bolero bracelet today and I was disappointed! Its much smaller than illustrated and the metal looks like silver! I can usually tell the difference between platinum, white gold and silver. This looks cheap.
",2
16382,"I liked the appearance of the pendent, however the the chime was more of a rattle. I had ordered the larger one also, and enjoy the mellow chiming sound.
",2
16384,"This pendant is simple and elegant. The size is perfect for a petite woman like me. However, I agree with a previous reviewer--the chime is more like a rattle. My friend has a harmony ball necklace that sounds angelic when she shakes it so I wanted one as well. I was really disappointed with the rattling sound of the 3 or so noisemakers inside the pendant. I would say it sounds more like a sleigh bell than a harmony ball. I'm too lazy to send it back too so I guess this pendant will make a good holiday rattle for the upcoming Thanksgiving and Christmas festivities...

16472,"Upon receipt, I noticed one earring had residue on it as if a label had been removed. These earrings are nice, but rather thin in weight and certainly NOT a perfect fit. I am not confident about the clasp which is rather thin. As another reviewer mentioned, the earrings sit on the ear leaving the post somewhat visible so these will be returned.

16478,"A gift to my wife ""just because"" she loved the way they felt and weighted not how they ""creep up"" and stay there. She does not use them as much as she would like. Don't buy them you will be sad :(

16525,"I ordered these to replace a pair i wore for years and had recently lost one.These are less than half the size i anticipated so sent them right back.Really disappointed. They are soooooo small...not as big around as thetip of my pinky finger.
",2
16546,"I am less than happy about the earrings as they are not as presented on the site.I was seeking earrings that are 0.75 to 1 inch in diameter. These rings were presented as being .75 inch in diameter but when we opened the package - the rings were less than about .5 inch in diameter. Oh well.
",2
16575,"I've purchased a lot of earrings for my wife, and she likes very simple and small ones that she can wear all the time -- sleeping, yoga, running, etc. These are small diameter, which is fine, but they are not solid gold. They appear to be plated and really feel like plastic. When I first held them in my hand, I couldn't feel any weight at all, and I would be embarrassed to give them as a gift.I returned these earrings, and Amazon was great, as usual, about the free shipping and quick credit. I ended up buying a different pair from a local jeweler. They were even smaller hoops, but because they were solid gold, they felt like something substantial.
",2
16599,"It may be my mistake that I did not see the size, but width was fine but size of hoop was tiny.
",2
16604,"The photo showing these earrings indicated 1 inch (I assumed in diameter) but apparently I mistook this after looking again at the diagram.. My mistake!! They are only 1/2"" in diameter - and that is NOT what I wanted. So I will return them for credit to my account. They are beautiful but just too small, and I will look for a larger size.
",2
16615,"These earrings sit unworn on my wife's dresser because they're uncomfortable to wear. Apparently the pin that fits through her earlobe is flat, which stretches out the hole.
",2
16619,"I bought this for my GF for xmas. They felt cheap to me. Also they are smaller than they appear on the pics. I wouldnt buy them again.
",2
16669,"These were typical gold hoops. Small-med and light. One earring was dented. I was not impressed with them. I returned them, but I was really hoping they would be nice so I could keep them. If the dent hadn't been in there, I probably WOULD have kept them as the price wasn't too bad. I will try again.
",2
16714,"I purchased these earrings about 3 years ago. I liked the color of the gold and thought they arrived in good condition. However, I noticed many times that the clasp would come undone such that the earring would fall off. Unfortunately, the last time I didn't catch it and now the earring is lost forever. Beware the sensitive clasp!
",2
16826,"The description on this item needs to make it clear that the earrings are extremely small. I thought I was ordering an adult medium size earring. The earrings came and look like they are for a child.
",2
16841,"While nice in style, the images shown are much smaller than you would think. It would be helpful to have the picture taken along since some measurement piece to give some size perspective.
",2
16854,"The pictures made them look bigger than I had envisioned. I returned them. I was hoping to get bigger hoops.
",2
16858,"I think I am going to have to give them to a kid. They are too small for me, unfortunately.
",2
16862,"They were pretty, but I was shocked by how tiny they were. I am a small person, but these were too small even for me. They were a very close to the earlobe fit. They would be perfect for a little girl.
",2
16868,"I actually purchased these in March 2004 and to give some perspective, they are so well made that today they are as good when I first purchased them. I did beat the current price, but at $19, they are still worth it. They are on the smaller side, as other reviews have noted, but they are still perfect for young granddaughters and those of us who prefer smaller hoops.September 1, 2009 update: I was amazed to see that the price has increased by over 10 times since I purchased these earrings in 2004. Allowing for the fact that gold has increased, all the same, if you buy these at the current price of around $140, you will be disappointed, notwithstanding the supposed, and inflated, retail price. Why? While they are pretty, these are very lightweight and fragile. They have held up over five years, but I am very careful with them and don't wear them that often. The hoops are about dime sized, so they are small. My guess is that a teenager would probably break these fairly quickly, again because they are lightweight and thin at the wire closure. My opinion is that these should sell for at least 50 percent off what Amazon is offering them for at present, and if possible, I would change my rating to two stars.
",2
16877,"When this item arrived, it was a very small loop ear-ring. Though nice quality, the smallness of the loop caused it to have trouble even fitting over the ear lobe....very dissappointed and will be returning.
",2
16921,"Gold has a dull finish and were smaller than I thought they would be. If you like loops that are nearly invisible, then you will like these.
",2
16922,"I rated it a 2 because the picture is grossly inaccurate!!! This earring is so small and very appropriate for a little girl. I had to return it. I believe the product is of very good quality however the picture makes it look like its for an adult- when you get the earring - you will be very disappointed. For a girl 6 and under - yes however for an adult - no
",2
16967,"The size of the gold ball itself was nice, but the post is shorter and the backing is smaller than shown. I was using it with an earring jacket and it was extremely hard putting the short post into the small backing.
",2
16973,"I looked everywhere, but couldn't find the missing clasp. Other than that, these earrings are great. The posts are short and the clasps are small so you don't have to take them out when you sleep.
",2
16974,"The earrings themselves are okay...not outstanding in quality. However I felt the way they were &#34;clipped&#34; to the tag was very low in presentation. They should have been put through a card of somesort, not clipped to the string of the tag.
",2
16986,"These are pretty earrings and seem to be good quality, but the ball is so tiny you can barely see it. Perhaps is they were shown with another object for comparison.
",2
16994,"These earrings arrived quickly and are a good size. They are not too big - I am using them for my second hole. The backs on them are a little loose and bend really easily which makes me a bit scared about losing them. I have been wearing them for a few days and they have been ok so far. Overall the earrings are nice but the cheap backs make them only get 4/5 stars from me.UPDATE: I had to change my review from 4 to 2 stars. After less than a month one of the loose backs fell off and was lost and the earring fell off. Very disappointing.
",2
17003,"They were so tiny and the back on one fell off in the shower the second day. I got these to replace the ones from Claires from my original piercing but in the end I went back and bought a pair of studs from there. I do not recommend buying this.
",2
17012,"The earrings are smaller than I imagined. I would have liked them a little bit bigger. It is hard to tell that I have them on.
",2
17015,"I wear studs 24 hours a day, every day and usually go 1-2 years before I lose one or a back breaks. I ordered a pair of these and within two weeks one was missing. I chalked it up to bad luck and ordered another pair. This time both backs broke on the same day within 1 week of starting to wear them during normal everyday wear. Low quality product, beware!
",2
17022,"One of the earring backs came with a sticky label on it and it was so hard to get off that it bent the back out of shape. I put on the earrings and not 5 minutes later the back was gone. The backs are so small and fragile that they are not adequate to keep the earrings on. I found another back from a different pair of earrings so I could wear them both but I dont trust them to stay on. I have bought a lot of items from amazon in the past and have been very happy with everything else but would stay away from the jewelry from now on.
",2
17025,"The picture listed on this page could not be further from what the actual pendant looks like.I asked for this for Christmas, my loving mother, bought it for me, and when she opened it, she knew I would hate it. It looks NOTHING like the picture. The pendant is cheap and flimsy. The gold and silver colorations are not very true to the picture, it barely sparkles or has the same personality as the photo listed on this page. It's not a terrible necklace, but this is NOT what I was expecting at all. The only thing redeeming about this necklace is the chain it came on. It's pretty high quality, but it's also very thin...so it gets tangled VERY easily without you doing much of anything to it.I will be posting my own images of the pendant in the user submitted photos section, so if you don't believe me, have a look for yourself and then make up your mind. But... buyer beware.
",2
17044,"for $10 these were too good to pass up. First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece. First time I wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.This is the second pair I bought... first set was fine. Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping (or a different supplier?)
",2
17046,"I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm & 6mm sizes. I was happy with all, but not with this 6mm size. These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner. While they look good, the posts are too short and very slippery, also the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily. I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost). Otherwise, they would have been fine. I returned them and would not buy this pair again.
",2
17047,"I was so happy with these earings until I wore them. The backs provided did not lock. I tried them on once, and the backs simply fell off. i managed to save both earings, and tried to find some ohter backings that would hold the earings in. Unfortuantely, this did not work, and the second time I wore them , I lost an earing. Perhaps the posts themselves were somehow wrong? I don't know.
",2
17056,"I chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo. They felt quite flimsy when I got them. I do like a lightweight earring, but not a flimsy one. The studs on these are not attached as firmly as I would like. One has already come off. They are however very pretty. The quality was just not what I expected.
",2
17075,"I agree...they are very dark and cloudy. Also, one of the earring's back just slides right off. They were really small too. I guess they might be worth the price...too bad I bought them when they were $99.
",2
17087,"The actual prong that goes into your ear is not round but flat and oddly shaped, so whenever I put these earring in they hurt my ears. So I've only been able to wear them twice and the second time I had to take them out because they became so painful.
",2
17162,"I purchased this necklace for my daughter for Christmas. It came completely tangled up. It took me a good 30 minutes to untangle it and it still has a small knot in it that I can't get out. It is super tiny. The picture is really deceiving. It looks like a little kid's necklace. Not worth the money.
",2
17164,"purchased this necklace for my girlfriend for $45 from amazon, so do not pay more. You may not want to pay less. Very cheaply made and extremely small. The picture does not do it justice. It came completely tangled up and took a good half hour to untangle. It is super tiny not worth the money.
",2
17180,"The earrings are nice & a great value at $30. However, the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore. The posts are not the typical size one might find in US stores. The posts are more typical of earrings that I have purchased in Central & Southern America; in fact, this is where the earrings were made. I returned them.
",2
17189,"Disappointed in the size and thickness of the earrings though its probably my fault since the description is accurate. I was hoping they'd be bigger
",2
17196,"I just find the posts to be thicker than I would like for my small earlobes and holes. Otherwise, they are of wonderful quality and arrived exactly as promised.
",2
17197,"These earrings are lovely, obviously good quality, but they have an odd design on the post that made them painful to wear for me. The post widens near the hinge, so it stretches the ear hole. I had to return them. With a different post, I would recommend them. As they are, I would not them at all.
",2
17207,"I ordered these hoop earrings for a christmas present. The post opening is extremely narrow and one would have to have very skinny ear lobes to feel comfortable. This opening of the earring should be listed in the description. I wouldn't have purchased these and wouldn't be out my return shipping. There is no room for a proper reason for return of the item and it's grouped into not wanting the item.
",2
17213,"I bought these for my wife for Christmas 2005. By August 2006 one of them fell apart. The gold loop is attached to the white gold loop by a very tiny and fragile weld, which broke. It was not due to any abnormally rough handling. It would have cost $50.00 to have repaired. Now they're throw-aways.
",2
17218,"these looked great online and when I received them, but the wires are too short if your lobes are thick. They piinch when closing them.
",2
17240,"I purchased these earrings and was pleased with how they looked but I can't wear them they are so heavy. They really hurt my ears, really a waste of money, I have other hoop earrings and have never had this problem before.

",2
17298,"I have purchased the jewelry before and I was very disappointed with the overall quality and appearance. This jewelry looks cheap and the quality is very poor. I would definitely suggest you not get this ring. In fact, I ordered the ring and gave them to my granddaughter.
",2
17351,"The necklace is MUCH smaller than I anticipated but still very cute. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions because it doesn't seem worth what I paid now that I have seen it in person. The chain is very delicate and isn't strong enough for daily wear. I'd recommend getting a strong chain if you plan on wearing this for more than special occasions.
",2
17364,"This item is way to small about the size of a nickel. I bought it for my wife and she returned it.
",2
17371,"I wound up returning this item the same day it arrived. I was buying it for myself because it looked so cute. Yeah it is - if you're about 14 years old. It is way too small for an adult. The detail is nice, but good luck seeing any diamonds unless you're planning on also wearing a jeweler's glass along with it.
",2
17373,"Its very small in size and very fragil and the tail part gets snugged on things.

17374,"Is devilish but very, very small. Should have paid more attention to size. Chain useless. Not worth the money.

17384,"I was not happy with the Gold Heart Devil Diamond Pendant because the pendant (as you can see in the picture) was not centered with the chain. If Amazon would purchase a different one that looked better than I would purchase it again. Thanks Monya
",2
17473,"The head of the duck is gigantic, and its cheap plastic. Really cheap. *no pun intended*..I thought this was cute when I saw it online, but once you receive it you realize what a waste of money it was. Wouldnt ever buy again.
",2
17517,"This ring is just okay. I don't like that it is adjustable. Why is it listed by size if it is adjustable. I never would have ordered it. Not only do I think adjustable rings are uncomfortable, they also look cheap. The face is okay, but not nearly as nice as I expected. I bought this when it was on sale and am still sending it back.
",2
17523,"I think the title says it all. These are little better than toys, and I do not expect them to last more than one or two uses.
",2
17524,"I purchased this item for my sister-in-law's birthday. She picked the ring out herself. She has had it for about 6 months now. It has begun turning her finger green. I think the manufacturer needs to do a better job of coating the ring with silver.
",2
17531,"I was told that the wide of this ring was 3/8"" and was 1/4"" I realize about that until I received it. I didn't get what I wanted. The ring its ok.
",2
17539,"I was very disapointed with my pendant. It looks better in the picture than real life. It might be a good gift for a little girl, but it's cheaply made and looks like it was stamped out in a press. I guess I was expecting better quality, but you get what you pay for. I gave mine away as a gift.
",2
17581,"while its adorable in theory, the design of this ring leaves something to be desired.i got it to replace another screw that i had, thinking that a white-gold star would be much classier than an ex-cz-sporting prong on my nose. when i put it on however, the screw sticks out of my nostril making for a really questionable and tacky silver ""booger"" situation.i would recommend this screw for someone who is pierced a little closer to the middle of the nose than the edge so more room is left to hide the back of the screw. otherwise consider yourself warned, and please give me credit for starting the whole ""ambiguous silver booger"" trend.
",2
17615,"Was disappointed in the size of the cross (and chain). Product size was listed as 3.2 x 2.6 x 1.5 inches -- but this is the size of the box, therefore it is very hard to judge how large it is.
",2
17622,"This item is pretty but very small. I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter, but I feel it would be too small for me to wear. There are diamonds, but they are barely visible.
",2
17627,"For the price, the cross is very nice but the chain is much too thin. Will need to replace chain because it is too difficult to take on and off. Also, scared that chain will break and I will lose cross.
",2
17630,"I was very disapointed in this item. Take a closer look at the picture on here you will see that even in this picture the links are not closed up. They were not on the 2 necklaces I ordered either. This thing falls apart, it is extremely dusty and the cubes are so pitted. The sides of the cubes are horrible too, not at all even looking. I wouldn't buy this again and sure would be returing the two I bought if I had time to order a new Christmas present.
",2
17639,"this pendant is hollow - looks and feels cheap to me. Picture is misleading. In a side view you could see that it's actually pretty thick - but since it's hollow inside it's not very heavy.On a side note, I actually ordered it twice - first order never arrived (probably because I was deployed to Iraq and the APO system does sometimes lose things) so when I got back Stateside I re-ordered it and sent the seller a message saying that the first order never arrived. 2 weeks later and I still have not heard back from them. Then when the second order arrived, I was pretty disappointed to have gone through so much trouble for what turned out to be a dinky little necklace with a cheap chain.
",2
17655,"I loved the talisman but the one big problem was that the chain turns the skin GREEN!!!!!!!
",2
17660,"dont get me wrong, this is a nice item. BUT the chain is CHEAP and turns your neck GREEN after a few days. The picture itself is starting to wear off after about 3 weeks. The ONLY time I wear it is during the day and I DONT wear it in the shower. The back of it is wearing off a lot.again, this is cool. BUT NOT WORTH the money you pay for it at all. May if it was half the price it would be ok. BUT DONT ship with the cheap chain.
",2
17670,"The item was as described, but has nobody else noticed that there's the symbol of Venus above the caduceus, not the symbol of Mercury? It throws the pendant off.
",2
17676,"I thought this would be a cute gift for my admin. assistant for her birthday - something to give her luck and centering, as she is a big believer in talismans and such. I was disappointed in the quality of the piece. It seems a bit rough around the edges. The chain on which the pendant hangs looks like something you would win on the Boardwalk, chunky but not too sturdy. It hasn't broken yet, but I did feel a little uneasy giving it as a gift. I buy a lot of jewelry on Amazon and always am pleased with the quality. In this case, I would think twice - no, I wouldn't buy again.
",2
17709,"I am very disappointed with this ring. It is very pretty, but once you take the string off it falls apart and there are no instructions to put it back together. My husband and I have been trying to put it back together based on the picture of the ring on this website and have had NO luck. Now all I have is a pile of silver rings that I cannot wear. If anyone knows how to put this back together, please post how! Thanks.
",2
17722,"The ring itself was pretty and sturdy, but beware what size you order because despite using a sizing chart, the actual puzzle rings never come in the right size. I wasted a lot of time and money trying to get the right size because the customer service was really slow and unhelpful. Unlike some better puzzle ring websites I've seen, this one didn't offer any guides or suggestions for choosing the correct ring size.
",2
17748,"It was nice and in good shape. Not as large as I felt it should have been according to the picture advertised. The chain was a very thin and I would say cheapened the product. The delivery was prompt and I suppose I got what I paid for.
",2
17751,"At first glance I'd give this 4 Stars, and the chain was very nice too. All in all it is a lovely piece but all that goes for naught if it isnt durable enough to be worn. My Girl friend wore hers for a matter of days and the chain separated from the pendant (no, the chain did not snap, the ring thats attached to the pendant actualy came apart, almost like it wasn't ""soldered"" on properly. Either way, I can't imagine how to fix it myself and with no where to attach a chain on the one side, its basicly usless. Thus, 2 stars.
",2
17778,"Both parts are not symmetrical and locking mechanism is rudimentary,the shipping believe me was not prompt.

17781,"Appeared to be very nice on arrival. But the fell apart after wearing them only twice. Would not buy again.
",2
17785,"These are nice amethyst earrings, nice purple color. However I'm returning them because they're too big for my ears. The basket setting makes them stick out too much. The setting is not very pretty. The gems are set very low into the basket.
",2
17838,"I was really disappointed with these earrings. The flat surface on the earrings are different sizes so they don't look right when you wear them. One area is large and the other one is small. The color is nice. I am probably going to return them.
",2
17840,"I wore these earrings for one day and the back was so loose on the earring that it was lost. I would not recommend this product.
",2
17846,"The color of these earrings was gorgeous and they were quite sparkly. However, they were NOT 6mm in diameter, and they were different sizes. They were each closer to 5mm, but one was larger than the other. Needless to say, I have sent them back.
",2
17863,"I purchased these based on the reviews and description, but was so disappointed. The settings were fine, but the stones are very light-colored, very clouded and have very visible flaws. They look much more like Jade, not emeralds. I have ordered other similar items from Amazon and have been pleased, but not with these. I really wanted a pair this size, but will be sending these back. Hope you have better luck!
",2
17865,"Not great. Returned these because they were an odd color and very tiny. Have been very happy with other earring purchases from amazon so tried these, but definitely not worth the price. (really don't look like emeralds!)

",2
17879,"The pin itself appears to be in pretty good condition for a cheap price. However, the pin is Made in China. I thought it was Made in USA because the company is in Colorado, but I was wrong and I am not happy about it.

17923,"When I first received this ring it was beautiful. It stayed shiny for about a month. Now 3 months later, is covered in scratches and no longer shiny. I ended up buying a sterling silver ring for much less money, and it is still scratch free after a month of wear. I was under the impression that 10k gold would not scratch as easily as 14k or 18k. Guess not. I would not recommend this ring, especially for the expense.

I wore the bracelet only a few times and now there are several major scratches that reveal dark metal underneath. This is a nice piece of 'junk jewelry' and nothing more.

I should have looked more closely at the picture and the reviews. It's far more hassle to return it and hunt down a new one than it is to just keep it and pass it along as a gift. If it were labeled correctly? GREAT gift. But useless to me now, other than a gift.

I was so disappointed because I really like the look of this ring and I got lots of compliments on it. Mind you, this only happened with the actual band of the ring. The crown hasn't turned color at all. I'm in the market for another crown ring but I'm still wearing this one in the meantime.

We notified the seller, who promptly sent us an envelope to send it back for another one. Thought everything was fine, but just the other day I saw another pearl was missing. So the first ring didn't last a day and the second lasted about a month before a pearl fell out. It's an absolutely beautiful ring, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort to keep sending back for a new one.
",2
18338,"I was very excited to see such a beautiful ring at such a low price. But my excitement soon faded to disappointment when I recieved my ring. Although it is very well made, the width of the ring just dosen't cover my finger. It leaves the sides of my finger revealed which was not what I was looking for. The ring looks bigger in picture than it did in reality. I hope you will take my warning seariously and not fall for this ring like I did.
",2
18470,"Though this ring is nice to look at ... it did not hold up. The ring broke into three pieces on the second day. My son simply went to put the ring on. He had not dropped it or hit it in anyway. Could be that is was defective on arrival, but when you have to pay for shipping, it can get costly.
",2
18496,"I don't think that this ring is truly sterling silver. Maybe its just plated. After wearing mine for a little over month, it began to tarnish. I thought that was normal and that it just needed cleaning until a week later when the silver had rubbed off and exposed a white colored metal. I was so disappointed because I really like the look of this ring and I got lots of compliments on it. Mind you, this only happened with the actual band of the ring. The crown hasn't turned color at all. I'm in the market for another crown ring but I'm still wearing this one in the meantime.

",2
18595,"I have ordered alot of things and this was the first time my order was not right, I am sending it back.
",2
18617,"I gave it as a gift but it was so tiny, I did feel a big embarrased to give it away. If I had more time I would have sent it back and tried for a larger pendant.
",2
18627,"Purchased for my wife for Valentine's day and the item is defective, not to mention cheap looking. The chain is not attached to the clasp - not broken, just purely a defective item. Unfortunately it adds more frustration that I am 1 month past the return window when I finally get around to doing something about it.
",2
18628,"I have been wanting to purchase this over 3 years, but because of lack of money havent been able to. Originally, this was in the 20$ range and I thought, I can get one for me and my 2 sisters. Yeah right. For this price, now 40$. Im better off just drawing a picture because it will have the same effect. I am very dissapointed by this product because the price just keeps on getting higher and I am not going to spend 130 dollars or whatever for 3 of them. Just ridiculous. Thanks for UPING the price!
",2
18643,"I had seen this necklace at a fair and unfortunately did not purchase it there. I was happy to see it available on Amazon. This one is smaller than I thought it would be and it is not made well. Cheap is the accurate word to describe it.
",2
18733,"So, this ring is really beautiful and I absolutely love it, except it is NOT 100% silver. I am allergic to nickel and therefore have to get silver or gold jewelry. I bought this ring because it was ""silver"" but low and behold, I got a really bad rash from it which would NOT happen if it were 100% silver. If you are not allergic to nickel, then go for it, its a great ring. If you are, don't plan on making this an everyday wear ring.
",2
18790,"The gadget does work. I find it bulky, gawky, looks like cheap plastic. I bought two, one as gift. Not worthy of gift giving.
",2
18853,"I really liked this design and color, but after a short while, the silver changes to grey and it fades away. What can you say, cheap.
",2
18861,"Obviously this is not a high quality product. I wore it for less than a day and it turned my finger green. I do not have any kind of allergy and I've never had this problem with my rings before. I am really disappointed because I like the way this ring looks and I love the design but now I have a ring I really can't wear. I will not be recommending this product to anyone.
",2
18882,"I ordered this pendant because the design looks great online, but once it arrived, it was nothing like the picture. It's very small, and the back of it is completely hollowed out. This wouldn't be a problem if it had a bail you could use to hang it on a cord, but it doesn't. So, in order to wear this pendant without showing the ugly backside, you will need to loop a soft cord (silk might work) around it. In the end, I am returning it because it's just not worth what the seller is charging for it. The quality is not great, but I might have kept it if I hadn't paid so much for it.

18912,"I bought this jewelry box for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas and I will be returning it. It's very cheaply made and the music would not play for more than a few seconds.
",2
18925,"Upon receiving the music box and opening it, I discovered that the mirror inside was mounted extremely crooked, so much so that I had to take it apart (which entailed cutting the material inside), realign it and glue it back together. After doing that, it was fine, but I knew what work I had done on it even though the recipient had no clue. It was very disappointing, to say the least. I'm only thankful that I didn't have it mailed directly to her because that would have been an utter disaster.
",2
18931,"Looks exactly like picture. Only one problem with it. The piece that starts the music box was stripped out.So I wasnt able to use the music box. I called company and they said the would exchange or refund my money. If I wanted to exchange it I had to send back and they would reimburse for the postage. To me it wasnt worth the hassle to rebox the item and take to post office to have it shipped back. I guess I would of preferred they just sent me a new one. And I could of just thrown the other away.Which In the end i did.
",2
18956,"Ordered this as a Christmas gift for our granddaughter, and the fairy hitches and stops while spinning. Unacceptable for a little girls Christmas present. It is really a lovely box, too bad I got one that doesn't play right. I have to return this.
",2
18961,"This is a really cute little jewelry box, but the dancer and latch broke in no time at all. The box is still intact so that's good. My 5-year-old daughter is very careful with her things, but after a few minutes the wings popped off the ballerina and then a little while later the whole girl came out. I was really hoping this would last longer than it did.
",2
18964,"When I found this, I was delighted. I ordered it, and it took very very long to ship, and arrive. When it arrived, it was exactly the same as something I already owned. The product description was too vague for me to tell what it was. I can't say I'll be coming back unless the descriptions get better. Since I'm blind, it makes no sense for there to be accurate pictures, but not written descriptions to go along with them.
",2
18972,"after not even a month of having purchased this item. This necklace has already broken. I probably should've looked at purchasing something a little more substantial and will in the future. But for this item and it's brief usage period. I would recommend you look elsewhere for better quality necklaces. Because this one isn't it by a long shot.
",2
18974,"I purchased two of these necklaces, but the first one broke the second time I wore it. Good thing I purchased two.
",2
18983,"In the picture the stone protrudes. it is just flat. Not real excited about that. And it's tiny. I was expecting a little bigger.
",2
19022,"Delivered with good speed and packaging, but unsatisfactory product. It looks like it came out of a cereal box. Don't waste your money.
",2
19057,"Bought them for my mom because she liked the picture. Too heavy to wear for long, but very shiny. She likes them.
",2
19131,"I liked the idea, but it wasn't pulled off well. The ring is cool looking, and the thought when ordering it was that I'd place it on between two silver swirl bands I already have. But the ring is bulky. And it's not stretch at all and I have BIG hands. Matter of fact, it's too big and doesn't fit tight to my finger at all, so I'd need my swirl band to keep it on my finger anyway. But I do love the stones in it, and for what I paid for it, I'm not upset. It is what it is.
",2
19138,"This ring is pretty but impossible to wear. It is way to bulky and your finger has to be spread away from the other fingers while it is on plus the chips constantly poke into you. One of those ideas that must have been good on paper but just do not translate. I have worn it on a chain before as a pendant and it did look nice that way for a fun casual look.
",2
19142,"Nice fish pendant, but not what I wanted. Wanted for a necklace. Would be nice is it was smaller, more delicate.
",2
19190,"The tiny screws that hold the lid on fell out within a month of purchase.Poorly made
",2
19212,"It's the large glass beads that are of very poor quality in this necklace. Too bad, I paid less for another Nvie necklace and I was more satisfied with that one than this one.
",2
19225,"I never ordered this item, never received it and have never even seen it's picture. Where do these items come from? I have received several request to rate items I have never ordered. However, it's cute.
",2
19240,"I was really disappointed in this necklace when I opened it. I ordered the ""natural continents"" version. The continents are obviously computer printed stickers that are stuck onto the marble. You could see all the pixels, and even see wrinkles where the sticker had overlapped. There was a big gob of glue on the top where the chain had been glued on. I had expected the chain to be a little heavier and of better quality. Instead it felt like one of those light fake childrens necklaces you buy out of the quarter machines. I cannot speak for the gold continent version of this necklace, but the natural continents are definately not worth the money, however, a portion of the proceeds do go towards environmental foundations and the marble is made from recycled glass.
",2
19268,"Probably seemed like a good idea to someone, but it totally does not work if you have hoop earrings....which I do and quite a few pairs at that, ranging in size from small to 3.5"" in diameter. Look again, there is no way these will fit in this design. My long dangly earrings don't fare too well either as the rows are too close together so long earrings overlap onto those below; also if you have spring ear wire types (french wires?) they are almost impossible to put onto this. Bottom line: too limited to bother with at least for my big earring collection
",2
19321,"This is listed as ""enamel"". Well, it isn't. It's some sort of plastic coating on the inner ring. Real enamel is glass, and it's quite durable. I washed my hands with this ring on - just regular soap - and it took the gloss off the ring. Pathetic! I should have known better than to pay this much! I won't be fooled again...I hope.
",2
19363,"This product looks very nice, but upon receiving it it is clear that the overall quality is very low. The jewels are, positionally, glued in place sloppily. After a few weeks of my girlfriend wearing it, it broke and is now in the trash. Don't buy.
",2
19367,"I bought a few charms from another vendor than Pugster and they literally fell apart. I was putting the charm onto my bracelet when the butterfuly fell off! It looked like they had glued it with a tiny amount of glue. The vendor did refund my money. But it was disappointing since I the blue butterfuly was pretty. The other charm was for my dog. Same thing happened the top part fell off...
",2
19377,"The necklace arrived today. It may turn out to be rather pretty, if I am ever able to get untangled. It arrived in a mixed up ball. Amazon did a poor job of quality control. It is so bad that I'm not sure it wasn't done on purpose.
",2
19429,"Not thrilled at all with these. One of the MOP discs was put on backwards and it is very obvious to me - one is shinier and has more ""depth"" to it than the other one. I gave them to my niece - she is 13 and imperfections like that don't bother her at this point in her life. She is happy with them.
",2
19447,"I was pretty excited to find this pendant because my husband loves the Yankees. I bought this as a Christmas gift.Well, after about 5-6 of wearing it, we noticed it had tarnished terribly on the side that was against his skin. The description states that it is Rhodium plated, but I have to truly wonder if it is, or how much, with the way the pendant current looks.My husband has worn other sterling silver jewelry continually without issue, so I don't think it's his body chemistry reacting to the metal.To be honest the metal looks as though I had bought it from a corner drugstore. I would not recommend this, for the price; it should not be looking like this after 6-8 weeks of wear. I looked into the return policy on it, and it's just too much hassle.
",2
19499,"The photo of the bracelet was accurate. I did return it, because I didn't like the way it fit my wrist, but that was my problem, not any problem with the actual bracelet.
",2
19502,"Make sure you read the fine print!This bracelet is silver TONED, not sterling silver. The embossing is also not the greatest - clear on the one side, but hard to see the letters on the other.
",2
19507,"I loved this bracelet. It was heavy and beautiful and I loved the saying on it. Unfortunately, since it's a cuff and I had to pull it a bit to take it off (you have to open it a little to get it on and off and tighten it when you get it on so that it doesn't fall off but that's normal with cuff bracelets), it actually broke in half the first day that I wore it and was taking it off. I didn't think that I pulled it that hard so it seems to me that it broke pretty easily. It's a beautiful bracelet but you have to be careful with it.
",2
19518,"this product was pretty crappy...if you wear it once or twice it will be fine. but my mom wore it for a couple of weeks and the silver finish wore off to this weird rusty under. Not a very good product if you want it to last.
",2
19577,"Didn't realize how large the pendant was - I thought it was going to be a cute little choker. It would have helped to have had the dimensions listed.
",2
19593,"I returned this. I was quite disappointed in the feel... it was like a feather, not like gold at all. However, I regret my decision since my final price was 157-dollars U.S., and it now is going for 490! My wife has slapped me viciously about the head and shoulders ;-}
",2
19602,"I have a moissanite ... SO beautiful. A huge piece chipped off in less than 1 year, although my diamond (similar wear and tear) lasted 18 years with nary a scratch. I thought moissanites were supposed to be hard! But apparently that's different from shatter-proof :(
",2
19603,"I really was hoping this ring would look similar to a diamond but when I got it, right away I could tell it wasn't even close. Then I put it up against a real diamond and two cubic zirconia rings and it absolutely looks more like a CZ than anything else. I bought this ring based on the other two good reviews but I have to disagree, this ring is a disappointment. Save your money and just buy a CZ or spend more and buy the real thing.
",2
19622,"This was not as pictured. It looked larger and better looking in the picture. When I received it, I was very disappointed.I did return it, and they were very good about the speed and the credit.I would buy from them again due to excellent customer service if I found EXACTLY what I was looking for.
",2
19633,"This silver charm of the Brooklyn Bridge is a disappointment. It is very lightweight silver and does not have the substance of a good silver charm. The definition of the bridge is not as good as it should be. Order was sent out very quickly.
",2
19655,"The ring itself its pretty. However it came with a tag around the ring that read ""Made in China"".... I cannot see the marking that says how many K the gold is and the diamonds look weird.I have to take it to the jewelry store and get it evaluated, because I am not going to be happy until I am sure this is the real thing. Obviously once I know I will make a different review. For now, I feel robbed to be super honest.If it turns out to be a scam I will let you know and return it, if it is the real thing I will re post.Please do not put ""made in china"" tags around expensive rings... if we wanted that we would buy them at k-mart.
",2
19669,"the only way the picture is accurate is to say that the earrings are lever backs with garnet tear drops.the setting was larger with the stones set poorly and significantly lower on the earring than pictured additionally the stones were significantly paler [almost brown in color] and smaller than the picture.i sent these back for a return which they provided but i had to cover both shipping and return shipping.dont bother, these are cheap.

19677,"I've been purchasing products from Amazon for a long time and this is by far the worst experience to date. The product is nice but it took 3 weeks to receive it.

",2
19781,"The earrings are merely acceptable in color. Descriptive terms &quot;dazzling, vivid ice blue with fire&quot; are an exaggeration. I would describe the gemstones as a faded denim color. The stones were small and slightly unmatched in size but that really wasn't as important as the color to me. The 14 carat leverbacks are very nice. I would not recommend the earrings unless someone was looking for light colored stones. The price however is very reasonable.
",2
19814,"These earrings appear to be a decent size in the photograph, but when I received them they were not much bigger than small diamond studs. They were so tiny and because of the subtle color, any one would have to look hard just to be able to tell I was even wearing earrings. For the price I paid I need a smoky earring that people will see. Not one that people need glasses to find. If these earrings were larger I might have really liked them. But for now I'm sorry I will be sending these back.
",2
19829,"The smoky-quartz stone was very light and appeared just lightly tinted. In addition, there was no way to determine the actual size of the stones from the online description. They were much smaller than I anticipated. They might have been a nice earring under other circumstances, but it was not what I thought I was ordering. They might be a nice earring for a teen girl.

19834,"These earrings have no blue in them! The picture is extremely deceiving!
",2
19844,"These earrings had a really pale blue color and they were much smaller than expected, but they did match my sister's necklace color.
",2
19860,"I received this as a gift. The bracelet is dainty. The sapphires are a dark blue, but the luster is ok. The quality of the diamonds do not meet all the specifications advertised. I can see black spots on several of the diamonds on my bracelet. They are more of an I than SI. I'd return this if it wasn't a gift. If I had known the quality would be below what was advertised, I would have asked for jewelry from costco. I will not be buying jewelry from amazon again without a certificate.

19912,"I must preface this review by saying that I have bought several other things from this seller (Silver Insanity) and have been very well satisfied with their quality. This ring, however . . . I liked it when it arrived. It was very pretty and shiny and it was a good weight for me--not too heavy and not too light. Just what I was looking for (I thought). After a few weeks of wear, however, it not only became scratched, which I fully expected as I lead a somewhat active life, but it also became dented, which I did not. From the reviews I read prior to purchasing this ring, I knew it was hollow. That was fine with me because I knew that if a ring of this width was solid, it would be too heavy for me to wear and be able to do what I need to do. However, I did not think the metal would be so thin that it would dent with each and every knock. I was wrong. I kept this ring and did not complain to the seller as it was entirely my own fault for not exercising common sense when buying it. Being hollow, there is no way to know how thick the outer or inner layers are and I failed to consider that when deciding whether or not to buy it. I will not shun Silver Insanity due to this one piece of shoddy merchandise. If there is another item that they offer which I like and want, I will not hesitate to buy from them.

The photo also makes the gold look thick and substantial. The metal is so thin that I thought I was going to bend it by just trying it on. It's a very delicate ring, and not at all what I was expecting. I was surprised because I had ordered a ring from the amazon collection about a month ago, and was very pleased with the quality, so I came to trust that most anything from that particular collection would please me. I sent it back the same day I received it. I can see it being a value for its price, and you probably can't find much better in that range - I think I'm reacting more to the disparity between the pictures and the actual product.

For the first week, I wore this ring happily and was impressed with its comfort (I would afraid it would be stabby) and attractiveness. Since the two flowers are not connected, I thought I might be able to adjust the band size slightly. A small amount of manipulation later...crack. I didn't break it, but it was clear that the ring was not at full strength. I kept wearing it, expecting it to split in half, and it would be my fault (though I would have expected something a little stronger).Then, about a week after that, I put on the ring in the morning and noticed one of the stones had fallen out. Now the ring is double broken. Lame. Considering my cheaper everyday ring, theMarvelous .925 Sterling Silver Band Princess Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Slim Promise Ring, has stood up to far worse mishaps, I think that the price on this ring is too high, and the production just isn't a decent quality at all.

20608,"After reading all the grave reviews on this item, I decided to give it a try and I purchased it. After receiving it, my first glance of this baguette &#34;diamond&#34; ring I was dissappointed. Firstly, these are the worst baguette &#34;diamond&#34; ring I've ever seen. Baguette diamonds are the most clear and sparkling cut which make it a special cut. After careful examining this item and have seen all kinds of &#34;diamonds&#34; of all grade, these diamonds look very much like &#34;promotional diamonds&#34; to me. Real baguette diamonds of any grade should be a bit clearer. never this cloudy for baguettes. This item of &#34;baguette diamonds&#34; are cloudy within the stone through and through; which lead me to strongly believe that this is &#34;promotional diamonds&#34;. Sorry, but this item simple did not go with my existing diamond ring. I had to return this item for it was not acceptable as &#34;real&#34; diamond baguette chips. However, if you do not know any better you can be mislead regarding the difference between &#34;promotional grade&#34; and &#34;real diamonds&#34;. I want it to work for me due to the price, but it didn't.

20626,"I am very disappointed in this product! There is a piece added on the inside of one of the bangles which is very sharp and scratches my arm. All of the bangles have cracks on the ""silver"" which is supposedly identified on the above-mentioned added piece. I did appreciate the information that the bangles were connected. I would not order from this vendor again.

20651,"I just bought these earrings and noticed as soon as I opened them that the backs did not fit closely. And I was right within a week I have already lost one of the earrings, and the gold posts are VERY thin and one of mine was already bent when I received the earrings. Overall a waste of money.

20701,"This ring is very nice; I like the looks of it. The only problem is that I bought this ring to wear in place of my wedding ring toward the end of my pregnancy. I ordered it a full size larger so I was sure it would fit. When it arrived, I couldnt even get it on my finger. When you hold it up to my wedding ring, they look to be the same size. The box it came in gave no indication as to which size was sent. So, they either sent the wrong size, or they run small somehow. I guess it will be worn after the birth of my son instead of now.

20704,"The ring looks pretty different from the picture online.CZ stones are really small.Although it's ok for its price, I still feel a little deceived.

20814,"I must say, I got this ring and was thrilled with it. It was my ideal ring, it was gorgeous, I got tons of compliments, hell, in a round about way I got a job because of it!That being said, this ring does not hold up well. Shortly after getting it the seed pearls started to crumble and fall off. At this point there are only 2 1/2 holding on. Also two of the garnets fell out of the settings, and the back of the band broke. The band broke first, and I didn't think much of it; its happened before to me, but when the stones started falling out I was very upset.This is a gorgeous piece of jewelry, but if you love it wear it sparingly or it wont last. Mine sits in my jewelry box because it no longer looks good enough to wear with the missing stones (not to mention the empty settings are sharp).
",2
20823,"I bought this ring about a month ago and have worn it 4 or 5 times. It's really beautiful, but one of the tiny pearls has already fallen out. When I got it out of the box, I expected it to be heavier than it was. It's very light weight and apparently not very well made. I'm bummed because it is a pretty ring, but definitely not worth the price, as it's already damaged. I'd say it's worth about $20 max.
",2
20885,"I was given one of these rings as a gift, it was beautiful, unfortunately it did not fit. The ring was ordered in a size 15 (yes I'm a big guy) and I do wear a size 15 but what came was not even close to a 15, it may be a 14 but it'd be tight even for that. The ring is not suitable for a pinky ring so I just stuck it in a drawer. I wish it had fit because I loved the appearance of it.

20919,"When I received this is the mail I was disappointed. It did not sparkle as my other Swarovksi pieces and the silver cheapens the look. I expected more crystals and less silver- unfortunately I did not get what was pictured. I even contacted the seller to see about returning it. The only reason I kept this over-priced piece was because I had also purchased the matching earrings and bracelet. The bracelet (the one with just crystals, no silver beads) is stunning and the earrings are decent.

20936,"I got these as an accessory to a Halloween costume. they matched great but they pinched my ears really bad. I would not recommend buying these unless you have tough ears.

20937,"This necklace says that it is 16 inches but has no dimensions for the actual pendant. It is extremely small and was not at all what I had expected or hoped for. It is very pretty but needs to have the actual size of the pendant posted for a more accurate description.

20991,"My husband bought these for me for Christmas and they are not what I expected based on the product description and photo.The description reads: ""Royalty and Elegance emanate from these extravagant sparkling etched Chandelier Earrings."" I expected the etching to be on both sides, not just on one, so you have to be careful which earring you put in which ear so that the etching side will face out and not the ""back side"". The words ""royalty"", ""elegance"", and ""antique"" give the impression that the overall appearance would be consistent with a piece of jewelry that could easily be worn to a prestigious occasion or suitable to wear to your own wedding and that is just not the case. Additionally, the word ""chandelier"" gives the impression that the two separate tiers are articulated and would hang and move independently (this is elegant), but they are fixed which makes these earrings look cheap and hang awkwardly; they are too large to be fixed. If they were they half the size they are, then a ""fixed"" chandelier would be acceptable. Admittedly, I couldn't really tell this from the photo, but the language led me to believe that this would be the case.

21014,"The diamonds were great HOWEVER amazon had a problem with their databases that delayed a lot of peoples stuff that day, I needed mine by a certain date for a certain birthday. When I knew it was not going to get here and trust me I paid for next day shipping I tried to cancel the order so I could just get them locally. I couldn't becuase the order status was preparing to ship (it said this for two days b/c of their database issues) so I wrote them about 5 email and continued to get cookie cutter responses about how I could check my order status online SO I called and was told well you won't be charged for the shipping... I didn't ask for free shipping I asked for my money back so that I could go get my wife something locally and again was told there was nothing they could do for me b/c the status of the item showed preparing to ship and they are having problems with their databases and i just need to understand that. Sorry but the page said if I ordered it by 3 p.m. it would be here the next day it should be and I am not daddy megabucks so I didn't have enough extra money lying around to go pay for another set w/o getting my money back from here first. So she got a picture and the gifting was not as exciting as it could have been. The only reason I waited so long was so she wouldn't see how much I had spent and spoil her surprise. Next time I will buy locally and just not have them bill me until the day of. Amazon did not listen and the worst part was getting the cookie cutter responses. I am hard pressed to believe they were read at all.

21046,"Lightning bolts are cute. However, the posts are LONG! So long that I have to take them out whenever I lay down because they stab me in the sides of my head. Had I known that before, I never would have bought them!
",2
21060,"I bought these because I thought they would be perfect to just keep in my ears for days at a time. I have several peircings in each ear so its easiest to not have to take them out all the time... but these star points are EXTREMELY sharp, theres no way I could keep these in over night, I did once and woke up with red rings all around the earing...so I dont even bother wearing them...
",2
21095,"The pendant is very pretty, but I admit I was a little surprised at how big it was (I didn't pay a lot of attention to the measurements). The diameter is a tad over an inch! The pendant itself has a very smooth finish so it does have a machined look rather than a crafted look, but it's still a lovely design.However, the chain, while it looks nice, is absolutely terrible if you have long hair as it catches and tangles hair very badly. Each little subunit of the chain flexes if it's curved (like it is around your neck), and your hair can get trapped in the gaps. I had to cut some hair to remove the necklace; it was tangled up that badly. Part of the price you pay includes the value of the chain, so this really reduces the value of the pendant.

21105,"This is the third time I have purchased this product but I am very disappointed this time. The packaging of this product from my prior two purchases were impeccable and it was a great gift for ladies in any occasions; it came with a little cute pouch made of soft velvet along with a product certification brochure inside the box. But now, despite the product looks the same but the little pouch is replaced with a large cheap looking pouch without any product brochure which makes it look cheap and undesirable...

21226,"I love artsy, interesting, non-mainstream jewelry, and this fits the bill. However, this piece is too weird to wear. The pin is designed so the enameled ""back"" of the ladybug (although I'm convinced it's a ""misterbug"" it's facial features are masculine), faces forward, this would be ok, as it is the enameled and colorful part of the pin - however there is a big hole going through misterbug's head - meant for a necklace or cord. So when you wear it as a necklace, the pin is facing forward. Not the best design, as no matter how you wear it, it looks like it might be on backwards.

21283,"I have had two of these rings. The first ring completly lost the stone. The second chipped. I teach, so I do not think I am being overly rough on the product. I think it isn't made well, although it is very pretty.
",2
21306,"Looks GREAT, but it is not wearable. It snags on everything, it does not stay in place on my toe. The band part is thin, already looks ready to break off - it is just a piece of metal open ended-not a full complete ring. I know it says 14K and that is soft metal,and since the band is so thin, it is already out of shape/bent/and after two (2) tries, I am unable to wear it. So much for my birthday present! I got this from my husband because I am handicapped/unable to wear closed toe shoes. I wanted a pretty toe ring to replace the rings I wore until they cut them off my foot prior to my last surgery. In order to put this ring on/wear, you have to pull the band away from the front of the ring then squeeze it your toe into it- then squeeze the band again to tighten it on your toe. The cubic zirconia's (all 3 of them) snag the rug, snag everything-settings are flimsy. I wanted a toe ring to wear 24/7 that looks pretty. I got the pretty part but can not wear it - period. To wear this on occasion, I believe the band would quickly break off with more that 5 times of putting it on and taking it off. I did not know until I got it that it was an open band design that you self adjust to your toe/squeeze it to fit.

However the back (Clasp) of the earring is cheaply made and lose fitting. My wife claimed that as her only concern with the gift and this proved to be prophetic as they did not last a week before one fell off her ear over the course of a day of traveling. This crucial detail turned a very satisfying purchase into a very dissatisfying one!

For about $40 more I was able to pick up much better quality and clarity. I can not say enough good things about the customer service at Amazon on this item though. Not one commment or critque of my taste or of my decision. I would shop Amazon again but look for higher quality.

I contacted NETAYA and they encouraged me to send them back for a free appraisal. They have since sent me back the wrong earrings that belong to another customer and sent my earrings to the wrong person. I am not a complainer but have been given a run around and not been told the truth. So while the earrings are pretty, be careful. FYI- I still don't have them back.

The clasp did not spring closed automatically, and apparently it opened while he was wearing it, fell off, and was stepped on and broke. I guess you get what you pay for! I would only recommend it for a very cautious child with a very thin neck. I should have returned it due to the clasp before it was broken.

22356,"Item did not accurately match description. Item was much smaller in size than anticipated. I had bought it for my 7yr old daughter to wear with her charm. Because of its frail nature, I'd suspect by the end of the month, the chain would have broken under the weight of my daughters small necklace charm.

In the picture, the chain has a more substantial weight and deeper silver color.In reality, this is a cheap looking chain, thin, too shiny, and easily crimped just by storage in a box. It doesn't make me break out, but I doubt I'll be breaking it in, either. This is what I get for buying jewelry online; the picture is better than the reality.

My first thought was it looked cheap and fake and almost bubble gum machine looking. The center stone is way too big for me and it sets up really high. I can imagine it knocking into everything and getting in the way. The stones go around the whole band and even with the thinness of the band it's too wide between the fingers and the stones scratch the inside of each finger touching the ring. This ring will be going back. Beware...this would be a hard ring to pass off as real looking! Also the picture of the ring is deceiving; I think it looks nothing like the picture.

23037,"I purchased these earrings to match jewelery I bought while in the Caribbean. The first pair had a defective back and the store replaced them literally overnight. That's service! They are pretty little earrings. Unfortunately, over a few months time the metal on the earrings turned a dark color and no longer look like rose gold. ""I guess you get what you pay for!""

23119,"I own both the starter bracelet and necklace that I bought at the Juicy Couture store. Since it is only gold plated the gold color strips and chips away with normal wear leaving your bracelet looking cheap as it reveals the brass underneath. If you get anything with rinestones, the rinestones may fall out(mostly on the charms). I do like them, and everywhere I go people always compliment me on them, even if they don't know about Juicy. I would say, they are cute and you can buy them, but don't expect them too last too long. The very best Juicy Couture jewelry to buy is the sterling silver but the prices are significantly higher. For a charm that in gold plating costs 40, the same one in sterling silver can be 150! My sister just received a sterling necklace that costs about 300! So spending about 30 to 60 on the starter gold plated necklace and bracelet and charms, is not too bad(although the charms are more expensive, but the bracelet and necklace look really nice without them). The best things to buy at Juicy are the tracksuits, purses, and t-shirts. Be careful with jewelry and even some of their shoes. So in closing, I love everything at Juicy, you feel like a princess when you wear anything from there, just don't expect their lower end jewelry to last in the same state you bought it in for very long. Definitely don't wear in the shower, pool, things like that to extend the life of it. And if you can afford the sterling silver, (as they don't have solid gold) jewelry, then that would be your best bet. Hope this helps!:)

23465,"After reading the glowing reviews for these earrings I ordered a pair as a gift for a friend. When it arrived opened the box to find the earrings in a plastic jewelry bag - they looked dull and something that could be easily made by my teenage daughter. I held them up to the sunlight (out of the bag) and yes, the crystals change color as expected, but at least the pair I received, are not Swarovski quality and lack the brilliance in color I was hoping to see in this item.On the good side - they are not overly expensive. Honestly though, I think they probably cost no more than seven dollars to make (having looked at jewelry making stuff in craft stores...). The packaging is your basic silver cardboard jewelry box for earrings with a piece of cotton batting in it. The earrings are in a small plastic jewelry bag, and the box is inside a plastic bag for shipping.They probably would appeal to some, but for me, they are a a 5 out of 10 in terms of overall value, look and quality. If I didn't need them as a gift 'right now' - I'd return them.

23484,"I purchased one pair of these earrings in May. At first theylooked so pretty and sparkled. In August, I ordered a second pairfor a friend. I noticed when I received her pair they were a shinysilver and have stayed that way. The silver on my pair is a lightgrey and the settings now turn my ear lobes black. I know I storedmy pair correctly. I got nowhere emailing customer service at GemAvenue. I now own a pair of earrings I cannot wear.

It truly would be beautiful if it wasn't so small and it's my fault for not reading. It's a shame though that pictures of items sold online are enlarged to look bigger. The title on this should be: Small Sterling Walking Turtle Pendant. Anyway, please read the description on this before purchase.

23669,"I bought this ring to replace one I lost, I was very excited to find one so similar. Unfortunately, the metal of the frog's leg seems to be more pliant than my old one because it lifts up with normal wear. As it lifts up, it is more likely to catch on items and people. It is difficult to wear this ring as often as I would like.

23699,"Good- nice band, no scratches, feels heavy.Bad- Cloudy white diamonds, one had a big black speck, not even close to clear diamonds...When they say ""white diamonds"" that is precisely what they mean. The description of the diamonds (H-I color and I2 clarity) is accurate in the ad, the photo (I feel)showed clear diamonds and was not accurate. If you are looking to impress anyone who knows anything about diamonds go to a real jeweler and spend the bucks.I am using this as an everyday wedding band to ""replace"" my original wedding set. My engagement ring use to catch on everything and this one does not. Now I can put my hand in my pocket without it snagging on the flap for instance. As a lefty the bulky wedding set was a nuisance.This is a good item for everyday wear. I don't have to worry if I lose it or damage it because it was so inexpensive. Basically, I calculated the value of the gold (I figured the diamonds as worthless) and the price (on special sale) was less then that so I really couldn't go wrong here.Additionally, if the seller doesn't provide the weight of the gold (without the gems), karat (10,14,18), and the minimum clarity and color of the diamonds DON'T BUY it. You're asking to be ripped off. Amazon is usually good about providing that information.

",2
23908,"The pendent was much larger than I expected it to be, and therefore makes for an awkward combination with the hemp. The ""clasp,"" as the other reviewers noted, is a real pain. It's not just a tie; it includes two separate, three-strand pieces one one side, and a small loop on the other. It's nearly impossible to push the six strands through the loop when you're holding the necklace in your hand, let alone when it's around your neck.

23942,"This item looked just as described when it arrived. It worried me that the chain seemed cheap so I replaced it with a silver chain I had and was pretty happy with it. But a few weeks later I looked down to see the pearl had come loose from it's stem and there was only a stem hanging from the pendant clasp. So if you only want to wear it for a few weeks this is a good purchase. If you want it to last I would suggest you look elsewhere.

24027,"I ordered this ring based on the photos, thinking that the stone would be a rich royal blue. When I received it, the stone was very dark, almost black. The photo also makes the gold look thick and substantial. The metal is so thin that I thought I was going to bend it by just trying it on. It's a very delicate ring, and not at all what I was expecting. I was surprised because I had ordered a ring from the amazon collection about a month ago, and was very pleased with the quality, so I came to trust that most anything from that particular collection would please me. I sent it back the same day I received it. I can see it being a value for its price, and you probably can't find much better in that range - I think I'm reacting more to the disparity between the pictures and the actual product.

I thought I knew what I was getting from this purchase but I was wrong.First, the stones did not match! One was a brilliant, near colorless gem. I was actually very surprised how nice it looked even though I had ordered an I-J color diamond. The second, not so nice. It was clearly yellow and not even a close match. It makes you wonder how someone could even pair the two together it was that obvious. If that wasn't bad enough, upon closer inspection you could see that the cut/design did not match either. The pattern was again, clearly different. To top it all off, we had to take a pressure backing from another earring and use it on this pair since the one that came with the diamonds did not have enough friction to hold on to the stud! This could have been a disaster considering that the reason I bought these was to replace the other stud that my wife lost due to a poor backing.I give this a two star rating because the first diamond exceeded my expectations for color and clarity. This makes me hopeful that their can be someone out there that will be the happy recipient of a stunning pair of diamond studs.All in all, my experience was horrible. I've never had any issues with items from Amazon and don't think I will in the future, however, this is probably my first and last jewelry purchase from Amazon.

I accidentally dropped it, it wasn't even a hard drop either. When I dropped it one of the moonstones broke and fell out, which didn't bother me much because it didn't really resonate with me that much anyways. To those reading this review, learn from my mistake and DO NOT BUY IT!!! This item is cheap and it should cost, at most, $15-$20, not $75 (or even $90- definitely not worth that much!). Instead, find another septagram necklace that's cheaper, more worth your money and will last a long time, or make your own pendant out of wood, imbuing it with your own will and energy making it resonate with you. Whatever you do, save money and don't buy this item.

25236,"This is pretty in picture, but not for small hand like mine. I am asian 5f tall, and have pretty tiny hands so if you do, this ring looks like a toy ring because this ring is very flat and the perl is just sticking out from the center. If you have big hands, this will be fit very nice...
",2
25245,"The ring is very beautiful, the rose quartz is pale pink and very clear. The ring was nice for about a week, then I noticed a gaping hole where my pearl was suppose to be. I' m not the person who wears jewelry only on special occasions, I buy them to wear them. Pretty ring, but too delicate for everyday wear.

25281,"I was thrilled to receive this ring in May this year. I combined the ring with a beautifully cut diamond and have enjoyed wearing it very much until recently. Since a couple of weeks my beautifull 18k white gold ring is turning yellow. Apparently I received a yellow gold ring with a thin white gold coating???As an international customer, what to do? I don't want to just send my diamond accross the ocean, but I'm not happy with the color of my ring.

What is going on with this seller. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!

25415,"The item was purchased for my daughter, no sparkle and it would bend pretty easily. My husband talked me into keeping it because we were short on time for Christmas presents. My daughter liked it but if given more time, I would have returned it and gotten something better.

",2
25473,"I ordered these earrings for my mother for Christmas and when they came I was really disappointed with the quality. The cats faces had marks on them and they seemed poor quality for being ""sterling silver"". My advice is to really watch what jewelry you buy online, the pictures are sometimes miss-leading.
",2
25492,"I am reconsidering purchasing anything from Silver Insanity. Some of their silver is quality, some is not, but you won't know until you get it. This entire ring is very thin and the filigree is crooked and I can bend the ring with little effort. However, it was inexpensive and I guess I just got what I paid for.
",2
25499,"It's a beautiful necklace. It only has one problem. The popcorn chain is linked securely to the fixed U shaped station. I wore it every day and after the 5th day it just fell off from around my neck. There is too much pressure on those fixed connection points, and the chain just can't take it. Also, this is a completely enclosed bezel diamond, so there was really not much shine coming from it, since no light can get thru from underneath.So, if you are going to wear it here and there, it's a great choice. It's very beautiful, but if you intend to wear it every day, it's not going to work out for you.( I actually bought it when it was $225 bucks, I see the price dropped to $180. )

25533,"I purchased this ring for my husband for our 5 year anniversary last year. It looked great, was comfortable and fit well. Almost a year to the day I ordered it he called me at work to tell me that it had broke. It is now in two pieces. It is so bizzare because it broke it two perfact halves. I can't complain too much since I paid under $50 for it, but I thought it would last more than one year.
",2
25544,"The chain is pretty cheap and only a simple round ring holds the heart on the chain. The heart is smaller than I thought it would be (my fault for not really paying attention to the details).I may put it on a nicer chain or even on a charm bracelet given it's size. The Mother-of-Pearl material is very pretty so I won't be wasting this purchase.

25644,"I personally used the tape and the e-water lotion together and the combination effectively subdue my neck-shoulder ache which I have for many years. I applied the lotion daily after bath at night and replace the tape every 2-3 days. I am convinced with the technology that I decided to try their jewellery products since having the tape seen on body is not a pretty sight to public eye. Before I make any haste/impulse purchase, I googled for the product reviews and realised it is a mixed reviews - ~50:50 positive and negative. As I am convinced with what I have experienced with the tape and lotion effect, so I decided to trust my gut feeling to get the bracelet. I take it as the 50% negative reviews could be because the users do not have any pain/aches to begin with so they do not experience any ""miracle"". For example, if you have a flawless skin to begin with, you will not expect any miracle effect even if you apply La-mer/SKII/Lancome/Estee Lauder expensive skincare product daily. That's the logic. I seriously ALMOST buy this product until I turned over the package and saw this: Made in PXXXXXXXXXS (not Japan!). Instantaneously, I put back the item on the shelf and re-purchased the tape and lotion (both are made in Japan) instead. Now I know why the split review on the bracelets because the manufacturing source is different - this is my gut feel by the way. I rather tape around my body inconspiciously to mimick the jewellery claimed effect than buying the actual jewellery where the quality is questionable by my gut-feeling and so not comfortable in buying at all.

25745,"I loved this design and was looking for a cross that didn't dangle. But after about two weeks of showering, the cross began to change colors (because of the cheap metal) and the center stone fell out, which is not prong set. Overall it was very disappointing. Nice design but poor overall quality.

25758,"I was disappointed with the size of the stone. This ring was a little nothing.

",2
25775,"I bought this bracelet for my boyfriend. He loved it, but that didn't last long because after just a few wears, it was so scratched up and dull looking it looked terrible. The gold overlay is just way too thin.
",2
25794,"Bracelet is small like other reviews have said. That was one of the reasons I bought it though as I have a small wrist. While the fit is fine for me, the color is not. It looks like a very cheap bracelet which it is but I expected more especially with some of the reviews that I had read about it. Oh well, you get what you pay for. Not worth sending back.
",2
25825,"This was not a bargain price for a quality item, as I'd hoped. Cute design, but more like plastic than metal. The loop holding the lower heart was open upon arrival, and upon trying to close it, the loop broke off. Too bad, as the photo is cute.

25834,"This item looked great on the computer, once it arrived it looked like it came from a gum ball dispenser. Very flimsy, and thin. The design is beautiful, but the quality is not there.

By the time I paid tax and shipping it was anything but cheap.Almost didn't give it to her and was going to send it back. However, she saw it in the bag and wanted it. She seem to like it, however, I didn't.

26037,"I loved these earrings but unfortunately they bend VERY easily and I will end up having to replace the hooks. However, considering the price I paid I guess that is to be expected.
",2
26049,"I was so excited to get this and was very surprised at how small it was. The 'diamonds' are more like diamond dust or diamond chips and in all honesty the setting is more sparkely than the diamonds are. It is pretty and I am sure it will look nice on but my first impression was ""OH! This is all it is?!""
",2
26076,"Very cute, but the inside of the rose fell out within 48 hours. Should have expected that for the price, but still annoying.
",2
26119,"The color of the ring was not as pictured, hint of the palest blue. The sizing is a bit smaller than anticipated and it seems that the stone side is more flat instead of round. It probably would have been more flattering to have 5 stones and a more circular appearance.It still stacks and is not that bad for the price
",2
26162,"I was not at all happy with this purchase. The topaz is very pretty but the s.s. looks very cheap, does not look like .925, It looks as if you could have bought it from a discount store.
",2
26196,"The necklace itself is lovely. It is delicate. I would have been much more pleased except for one thing. My cost was $18.99 plus shipping. It arrived in a tiny baggie with the price of $8.50. That is one super make-up! They could have at least taken off the price tag before they mailed it, and I might not feel like such a sucker!

",2
26321,"The bracelet was cute, however the packing was terrible. The bracelet almost fell out of the box when I received it. Also, it was not long enough. I feel like I overpaid for this product.
",2
26380,"This necklace is a perfect example of the old adage, ""You get what you pay for."" I paid $11.40 on sale.First of all, the pearls are similar to the color of orange juice. Second, they are so blemished and uneven that they don't even look like real pearls. Third, there is no clasp in the back. The pearls are strung on a rigid wire that will hold itself closed unless the necklace is tugged on by children, pets, etc.I gave the necklace two stars instead of one because it appears to be well constructed and could conceivably be worn for an occasion that calls for tacky orange pearls. Maybe a Marge Simpson costume?
",2
26381,"This choker seems well made, but there is a lot of inconsistency in the color and shape of the pearls. They are a soft golden yellow color, but the dye looks strange. The necklace looks like the color would bleed onto your hands if you touch it, perhaps due to the sheen of the pearls. This makes it look inexpensive. I would not make this purchase again.
",2
26413,"These wouldve been perfect for my industrial piercing but I couldnt get the earrings pen. I dont know if its me but it just wouldnt budge
",2
26416,"These earrings are very tiny, nothing what you would think from the picture, and I guess you get what you pay for. I bought them for my daughter who thought she was going to use them in her tragus piercing, but they are way too small so she just uses them in her upper cartlidge piercing instead.

",2
26504,"Ordered this for my girlfriend for Christmas. Not bad for a cheap charm bracelet but keep in mind that if the person to wear this does not have a small wrist then it will not fit! 2 missing stars because its so small, it barely fits on a tiny wrist.EDIT: I wouldn't get this thing if you are going to be wearing it while doing ANYTHING active... went out to a movie and it broke. it is unwearable now. Good looking but very cheaply made.
",2
26514,"I bought the ring and the first time he put it on his hands were sweaty and the metal left a mark on his finger. He then wore it for three weeks and it started to crack and finally broke. I would not recommend this ring at all.
",2
26529,"I bought the cord to go with a specific religious pendant. The religion is not important here. It is well made, but is too fat to fit through the loop. In order to make it work, I would have to bend the loop of the pendant and make it much rounder. Since it is sold by the same company that I bought the pendant from at the same time, I expected it to fit.If you are considering it, email the company first and ask them if it will fit!
",2
26553,"This is a very pretty necklace but it is way too long. It is 20 inches, though the ad said 16. I had to pay a jeweler an extra $20 to shorten it 4 inches. I would have preferred to return it, but my husband wanted his mother to keep it. Therefore we ended up paying an extra $20. Would not buy from them again.
",2
26592,"This broke before I can even get out of the house.
",2
26617,"The earrings I received did not resemble the ones from the picture on this web site. The very bottom bead in the picture is a very pretty pink-ish color and that's what I was looking forward to when I ordered these. Well, the earrings I recieved had more green on the bottom bead than pink. I didn't like the fact that there was more green than pink and I didn't think it was worth returning them so I literally got out a bottle of pink nail polish and just painted them the shade that I wanted. Wasn't what I expected but you get what you pay for.
",2
26700,"the earrings looked exactly like they look on line. However in my rush to go away for Christmas I did not open the package before leaving home. When I opened, I saw that only one earring had the hook on it. I could not wear it at all. I had already destroyed the package in which it was mailed and I do not know my options. SO one earring looks great but no hook on the second earring.
",2
26743,"I bought it for me.But the pearl looks like a toy bead.So I don't like it.
",2
26797,"I bought two of these necklaces for my bridesmaids. The chain on this necklace is a very poor quality. It is very flimsy and looks like it will easily break. The pendant was also much smaller than I expected it to be. I was able to find a better quality necklace locally for a lower price and ended up returning them.

26802,"There doesn't seem to be enough of the polishing element in the cloth. It takes a very long time of polishing to take any of the tarnish off.
",2
26810,"Got this for my sister who collects frogs. The pin part broke the first time she tried to pin it on her jacket. I felt bad, she uses it as a little shotski in her display case. Not made well. But cute.
",2
26837,"The bracelet arrived quickly and was as described except its color was dull, unshiny and not particularly appealing. I was disappointed in its lack of brightness compared to the photo in the description and returned it immediately.
",2
26839,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this bracelet is neither masculine looking nor 8 1/2 inches in length. It might be acceptable to give to a young teen, but I would hesitate if considering it for an adult. It doesn't have a particularly substantial look or feel to it and it comes closer to appearing feminine.
",2
26853,"The design is nice; however the stone color is a bit of a dissppointment. It is a dull yellowish green and not very sparkly.
",2
26884,"It doesn't quite look the same as it does in the picture and the sizing (to me) seemed to be somewhat bigger than the size I had asked for.
",2
26914,"Earings are in good size, but quality of silver is not good. It is dark.... And corrupted clusp... Now I use this item, but silver is black.... I think it is bad quality of silver.
",2
26917,"I like the idea of this bracelet, and it looked pretty in the box, but I didn't like the way it looked on my wrist. To get it to look right I had to twist it before the clasp was fastened and it was just too hard to do. Also one of the chains was longer than the others and the excess stuck out. I returned it.
",2
26989,"I received this item and it is what I was looking for but the end cap needed repair before I could wear it. It had come loose.

27011,"This chain kinks (permanently) too easily, which makes it sit funny. I originally bought it to replace another chain, but I am very dissatisfied with this chain. I would not recommend this product.
",2
27020,"It broke in a matter of months, I guess the price was too good to be true. The silver is pure though, I didn't get any irritation from the metal, even when not taking it off for weeks at a time.
",2
27055,"The photo of this necklace is not the same as the actual necklace. If you hold it up to the light it may appear the same, but when you put it on.... it doesn't reflect the colors..... Pretty disappointed. I got two different necklaces and they are the same.... Will not buy anymore.
",2
27082,"he's only been wearing it for a week and the silver is beginning to tarnish. Perhaps a good cleaning will restore the shine but I'm disappointed that it needs it so soon after he began wearing it.
",2
27135,"I had to go back awhile to write this review, but this ring is NOT worth the amount. For 30 bucks, I expected a heavy, solid ring, this was a cheaply made, semi hollow waste of time and money. To make matters even worse, I ordered a size 8 and recieved something much smaller...it is items like this that frustrate the public, I thought I ought to warn somebody, but if you like this ring, KEEP SEARCHING and you will find a quailty product somewhere else, this one however is not...
",2
27142,"Bought for my wife. When I received it, the top cover had visible scratches. I assume that was due to inadequate packaging. Also, after less than a week of use, the bottom drawer fell apart.
",2
27147,"Unfortunately the product I recieved was defective and had to be returned. The bottom drawer was stuck and wouldn't come out. Not only did this eliminate use of that drawer, it also prohibited the attachment of the legs to the armoire since the screws to attach the legs were located beside the bottom drawer.The Company I purchased the armoire from, VISIONDECOR, was very accomodating and easy to work with. I highly recommend doing business with them.
",2
27160,"Blame me for thinking this looked like something Thomas Crowne would have his keys on, I should have known you get what you pay for. Not solid at all it bean to tarnish after one week of use and the metal is very soft, it bends under the slightest of pressure and will never really retain the pictured design. After two weeks it was tossed in the trash, lesson learned.
",2
27167,"Wore the earrings twice and the device that you secure them in broke, not very good quality.
",2
27172,"If you want me to buy your product first let's compare apples to apples. Where is the description detail? The size would be a very important piece of information for me to have to consider purchasing this item.
",2
27202,"The seller is correct in stating that this ring is fragile. I wore this ring only once. When I was taking it off, it slipped out of my fingers and dropped approximately 8 inches into the sink bowl. The ring broke into 4 pieces. My concern would be that it might break while someone is wearing it - I would think it could cut someone.
",2
27205,"The purple isn't that dark....I was disappointed that it was lighter in color. I had it for about two weeks and I was out with friends and hit my hand on the able and the ring shattered.
",2
27210,"I ordered a purple ring. The one I received was a light pink color. I don't know if they sent me the wrong one or if the website picture was off. It also had a crack in it, but I wasn't sure if that was an inherent part of this kind of jade. It didn't cost very much, so it wasn't worth my time to return it. It came in a cute heart-shaped box with a bow on top. I just gave it to my 3 year old daughter to play with. She liked it. She had it for a couple months and dropped it on a hard floor then it shattered into pieces. Oh well. She enjoyed it while it lasted.
",2
27213,"Stones are nice but the posts had rough spots that I had to clean off to keep from snagging in my ears. Once removed it appears that the silver is only a coating.
",2
27222,"Cute and inexpensive bellyring. Beware if you leave it in while showering it tarnishes & turns black within a week. I guess you get what you pay for..
",2
27236,"After reading all the other reviews, I was thoroughly excited to receive this ring! However, when I got my ring there were several scratches on the ring, some were very dark scratches making them even more noticable. The design, size, & weight of the ring are great. Their customer service offered to replace the ring ONCE, but I chose not to risk getting a ring the second time that looks even worse. I am wearing the ring which obviously means it doesn't look completely awful. However, I cannot say I would recommend this...especially if you are gifting it to someone else!
",2
27274,"The strand was beautiful, although not all the pearls matched well in the terms of luminosity, and a few had ripples, but pearls are not perfect. I was thrilled when I took it out of the box. It comes in a wonderful padded booklet type storage folder, quite elegant. I wore it to work today and 5 hours into my day, I went to re-adjust the strand, as I had it doubled on my neck, and with one little lift and very light tug at the strand it pulled apart and sent a pearl flying across the floor. Its going back and as much as I'd love to order a replacement, I would never feel confident it wouldn't happen again. I have a 40 dollar strand I bought on Amazon a couple of months ago, with less perfect pearls, and I use it as a lanyard for my flashdrive. Never had any problems with that one. Much as I wanted to love this strand, I can't trust it now. This is something I would want to be aware of, if I were thinking of buying.
",2
27288,"I knew within the first few seconds that this ring would be going back. I've been looking for an inexpensive band with a row of sapphire-like stones in the middle and a row of diamond-like stones both sides and I was hoping this would be it but it wasn't. This looks cheap. What was truly surprising is that they got the CZ to look so authentic but the ""sapphires"" looked like beads. This ring looks like a novelty ring. Certainly not worth the price!
",2
27393,"It is not huge! It is so small that my daughter can't fit her toy jewelery in it. It is a toy.
",2
27405,"I bought this charm for myself cause it's my birthstone but when I recieved it I was not happy with the way it is made. It doesn't sit flat on your chest, no matter what chain you put it on. It's very small and I don't think the color is very good. I NEVER wear it!
",2
27406,"There is no way this pendant will lay properly due to the poor design. I'm not thrilled with the color of the stone, either, but could overlook that if the pendant would lay flat as it appears in the illustration.
",2
27412,"This charm is meant for some other application---it does not work on th chain it comes with....but it is beautiful. If I find out HOW it can be used, I'll update my review. Some people have suggested it's a belly button ring charm, a pearl enhancer---but I don't know how it would clip on or a charm for a torque.

27414,"The watch is nice looking, but the links are really cheap. The are made of a thin metal and dent very easily.

27447,"I bought this for my gf. It's nice for the price, but the clasp NEVER holds. It comes off ALL the time.
",2
27450,"Online this ring looks great, but in person it is disappointing. I have small hands (size 5) and while it is obviously a dainty ring, the teeny stones made it look like children's jewelry. The prongs are the only metal that is visible when you wear it, so looking down at it you can't appreciate that the ring is made of 3 different colors. Based on the other reviews I took a chance and I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake. I've returned the ring and am looking forward to picking out something else. Amazon as usual made the return process very easy!
",2
27485,"I have to agree with the first review, this ring is simply overpriced. I've owned several tungsten rings now, and have never payed more than $50 for one, and some much less than that. And I'm talking about rings that are far fancier than this one. Here's a roughly equivalent tungsten ring for $30:High Polish Beveled Edge Tungsten Carbide Ring sizes 9 to 12And that ring features only minimal styling. You could just as easily move up to this absolutely gorgeous ring which features a similar concave design but also gorgeous laser cut-styling, for a grand total of $49:8MM Concave Black Laser Etched Tungsten Carbide Ring Wedding Band Sizes 8 to 13In fact, a quick search for tungsten rings on Amazon will quickly show that these prices are not unusual, but are in fact par for the course. Tungsten is a perfect ring-making material that I highly recommend. I have two that I've worn for over a year now that are still scratch-free, despite the abuse I put them through, wearing on the job, etc. So unless you're absolutely dying for this exact styling you have a lot of options.On another note, I own a concave ring similar to this one and must say that they look and feel great. Even though tungsten doesn't scratch, the concave design makes the possibility of scratching even more remote. I own the second ring I linked here, and I am quite confident that the center design will remain beautiful for decades to come due to the protective concave shape.

27573,"Shipped quickly the wrong ring. Wanted me to pay for return shipping on their mistake. Took almost a month to get proper ring shipped to me. I gave an extra star for the ring as it is a very nice ring. Procede with caution on purchasing. If you get the problem I got, get Amazon involved quicker than I did. It wasn't until I contacted Amazon, rather than company directly that I got results.
",2
27579,"I ordered this ring after purchasing the Amazon Amber Celtic Love Knot ring and loving it and I have to say I am pretty disappointed. It is not nearly as nice, the stone is too flat in the ring, and it turned my finger green within a few hours of wear. Sterling silver isn't supposed to do that. I don't think I will be purchasing any more items from this seller.
",2
27706,"This is a cute ring however if you don't keep it on your toe and have to continually adjust it, the metal will give and it's broken. This would be more worth it out of a cracker jack box.
",2
27707,"EDITIt broke after a week of wearing!This a very cute toe ring! only thing is that of course because it is filigree its going to be brittle so be careful! I would not take this one on and off allot, but it does dig into your toe if you are wearing socks and boots. It left a bloody ring round my toe where it dug in. I have been wearing toe rings my whole life so I'm used to that feeling but if this is your first time I would recommended one that is flat all around.As for he look, well its allot prettier in person! very cute and flattering! I thought it was going to be bigger because of the picture put its really the perfect size! I'm very happy with this purchase!
",2
27717,"Let me compliment these earrings first: the gems are quite beautiful - definitely fire opals despite being created stones. The gems have a rich depth of color and the gold complements the stones well. My problem with these earrings is that of workmanship. The first (and only) time I tried to wear these, one of the posts broke off. I pulled (gently) the back off the post to put them on and the post snapped off at the earring. I haven't been able to wear them at all. I wanted to return these but can't because I have misplaced the receipt. Other items on Amazon can be returned from the order online, but this isn't one of them. I've had good luck with SilverSpeck before but in this case I was disappointed.
",2
27739,"This ring only works if you want a cheap looking piece. The silver is high enough quality that it didn't turn my finger green but the stones are visibly fake. The baguettes are especially horrid and the *emerald* cut is really a radiant cut. The only good thing is the company's fast shipping. It actually got here 2 days after I ordered it. *You get what you pay for* definitely applies here.
",2
27743,"Item cracked and broke after only about 3 days of wearing it, it was cheaply made and a waste of money.
",2
27766,"The smaller size does not matter with this ring it looks super fake! Mine looked so plastics I was embarrassed to even wear it on my right hand. I bought the ring just to try different styles with my wedding bands. The price was right for a trail ring but nothing else. This ring is going in my junk drawer.
",2
27824,"First of all this ring is very small.... It is cute though. I purchase it as a place holder while my wedding rings were being sized. The fit isnt true. I am a 6 and the ring wouldnt stay on top of my finger it rolled aroud. Also, it looks plastic... Nothing real looking about it.
",2
27894,"this ring was not what i expected at all from looking at the photos and reading the previous reviews. the stone is not like the othe cubic zirconias that i have seen. it has this very defined ""X"" shape in the stone from the way they cut it. the metal is very very cheap. it gets scratched very easy. i guess its a good temp. ring till you can afford a real ring but dont expect anything more than a vending machine quility ring. thats exactly what my bf said when he saw it.
",2
27895,"The ring looked like I got it from a vending machine. Granted it wasn't much, but I still paid to much for it. The picture makes it look great. My ring wasn't even close to looking like this.
",2
27914,"I bought this ring for my gf. We were very surprised when we find out that this ring was really poor quality. It means not white gold only from some metal and sapphire was really not sapphire but only zircon or something like that.
",2
27918,"I love how this ring looks but, if you wear it for a long period of time it starts to irritate your finger. The bottom of the diamond is sharp and it sticks into your skin.
",2
27925,"This was a first time for me.I expereinced an extremely late delivery. When I did recieve the earrings one was broken, or apart, and seperate from the other earring which was in a plastic and zipped envelope????Since I had allot of expereince with making my own jewelry, I was able to use my personal jewelry tools to put the earrings back together.Once this was accomplished,and the earrings were on my ears, they did not face forward, they seemed to turn in the wrong direction.After lots of tweaking, being careful not to break the metal, I was able to adjust the earring to face front ward.For the price and time spent selecting these earrings....I felt this purchase was not worth all the trouble and repair time I had to spend....The delivery was seperate, even though I requested these earrings be combined with additonal purchases, I had made / purchased the same day, therefore S&H; was additional so I felt for all the trouble and cost, these earrings were just not worth my efforts.They are also weigh heavy on my ears...Rather than return these earring and incur yet additional S&H; fee's, I will gift them to a friend.
",2
27949,"I bought these earrings for my mother for Christmas. I was very dissappointed. The pearls are a milky white, not pinkish as they appear in the picture. They dangle a tad crooked. The pearls themselves are average at best. I do not recommend these earrings.
",2
27959,"Although the gold colour was rich and appealing, the size of the charm was way too small for my purposes. So, I returned it for a refund.
",2
27986,"earrings were a little too small for me but I kept them. The measurements throws me off.
",2
27994,"Twenty dollars for a ring does not guarantee its quality, but it shouldn't mean it's a piece of junk either. For the first week, I wore this ring happily and was impressed with its comfort (I would afraid it would be stabby) and attractiveness. Since the two flowers are not connected, I thought I might be able to adjust the band size slightly. A small amount of manipulation later...crack. I didn't break it, but it was clear that the ring was not at full strength. I kept wearing it, expecting it to split in half, and it would be my fault (though I would have expected something a little stronger).Then, about a week after that, I put on the ring in the morning and noticed one of the stones had fallen out. Now the ring is double broken. Lame. Considering my cheaper everyday ring, theMarvelous .925 Sterling Silver Band Princess Cut Clear Cubic Zirconia Solitaire Slim Promise Ring, has stood up to far worse mishaps, I think that the price on this ring is too high, and the production just isn't a decent quality at all. Unless the price drops by half (at least), save your money.
",2
28011,"I was really excited about this necklace. The picture looked really cool. But in real life, there are symbols carved onto some of the beads (they look kind of arabic to me, I don't know if they are, but I sure don't know what they are or what they mean). The larger beads are not really ""beads"" they are woven balls (they are not hard). This is not something I would wear.
",2
28039,"I bought this ring to replace my real diamond wedding band, to wear for everyday use. When I first took it out of the box I was amazed at how real it looks and feels. It's a fairly weighted ring, does not feel cheap. Once I put it on, I fell in LOVE with it! I actually like it better than my real ring! I have read other reviews that say the center diamond is to small or set low, but in my opinion, thats what I love about it the most, it gives it this modest yet expensive look. I didn't want a fake ring that looked to unreal for me to be wearing or too REAL that I get mugged! (meaning HUGE& SPARKLY) Overall I'm very very happy with my ring, and I would recommend it to anyone! :)UPDATE:01/10/11I am so sad, after wearing the ring just a few days one of the stones fell from the solitaire. I really loved this set, the look, the fit and the feel, but unfortunately I must return it! :(
",2
28070,"I love the look if the ring but the first day I wore it to work and I'm a hotel manager so I have a desk job I picked up a stack of books and my ring bent and no one can fix it
",2
28075,"I bought this about half month ago. But it start to get dark now. Is it sliver??? Not worth the price, not fit for everyday wear.
",2
28076,"it looked real/beautiful on internet but when i got it, i wasnt satisfied 100% at all. This item will be my first and last order.
",2
28078,"I have to say I was a little disappointed when I received this product. I was looking for a temporary set while my wedding set was getting worked on and thought I would give this a shot since it had pretty good reviews. I knew I wasn't getting diamond quality, obviously, but these rings look very fake even from an arm's distance away. However, Gem Ave's service was very good and I received my product in a timely manner.
",2
28085,"I got this set because I lost alot of weight and I am not able to re-size my old ring set since the diamonds are all around the bands :( So I figured this is going to be a nice replacement till my husband is getting me a new set for my birthday in December. To be honest I dont believe this is going to hold up for 6 month at all. The ring set is made very poor! There is a gab inbetween the stones witch I will end up loosing! I know what I am talking about I work in this department. The price tag should have told me everything! Not worth sending back so I will stuck with it and hope december gets here fast! :) I would not recommend buying this set! Save your money and get something nice. Oh by the way if my husband would have bought me this set I would have killed him lol but since it was my own stupid idee I can even blame anybody but myself so guys be advised she will say NO if you buy her a crapy set like this! I know I would for sure! Please dont mind my english I am a proud German and yes this ring set ships to Germany thats the only reason I gave it a 2 star!
",2
28111,"The rings look great together. I really wanted to enjoy it for a long time, but it lasted about 2 weeks. First let me say that the center stone was not sitting evenly in the prongs when it arrived, but I thought it looked fine. One of the prongs got caught on something and got bent after a couple of days of wear. I bent it back in place, but it looked like it could snap off. Well a few days later it did break off and a few hours later I lost the large stone. I found the stone, but the main ring is not really wearable until I can get it fixed (add new prong). I am thinking the fix will cost as much as the ring so I am not sure what to do. The set is beautiful and I wanted to use it to replace my original set, but obviously it was not made well.
",2
28117,"Upon opening this ring, I thought, ""wow, this is beautiful!"" And then I took it out of it's cute little box and my heart sank. It was lighter than air, and felt like it was made out of plastic. I wore it for the day, took it off that night, and realized that it was scratched where the stone on the engagement ring meets the wedding band.I am sadly disappointed in this purchase. It was cheap, and now I know why. I was unsure of whether or not I actually wanted a fancy diamond wedding set, and this answered my question, at a very inexpensive price. I now know that the traditional wedding set is not for me. I'm glad I purchased this ring first before I purchased something far more expensive.At a glance the ring is beautiful. If you don't mind feeling like you are wearing a plastic ring, then go for it. I for one need something a little more substantial and will be purchasing a Robert Lee Morris ring for my wedding ring.
",2
28137,"I loved this ring at first, It was very sparkly and realistic but I only have had it for only 1 month and two of the side stones fell out! I didn't hit it on anything. I don't even know when it happened, I just looked down and it was broken. I don't do anything that is really hard on my hands but I am a medical assistant so I wash my hands a lot and it has gotten pretty dull. I was really disappointed by this ring. I really had high expectations because of all of the rave and wonderful reviews... but now I'm just sad.
",2
28160,"My fiance bought this ring and put it on my finger a month ago. It was beautiful and we were so excited. After a month of regular wear, the band started changing colors, the band has bent, and we cannot get it fixed. Furthermore, the stone has a milky color to it and cleaning does no good. This ring has broken both of our hearts. Buyer be warned. If you intend to wear this as an engagement ring (as in one you don't take off), don't buy this ring. If you plan to wear it as costume jewelry, I am sure it will be fine.
",2
28165,"ordered a size larger than I would usualy wear, after reading the last review, and it still doesn't fit. I want to send it back but then I will have to pay for shipping and they say that you need to put insurance on it if you are sending it back :(
",2
28204,"It is very cheap for 1/2 carat, but you get what you pay for. The diamond I received has a very visible flaw in the middle. I ended up returning it. Have no complaint about Amazon, which is very fast in shipping and easy on return.
",2
28241,"The product was a little smaller than we expected. I measured it and it was 7 inches but just too small for my wife's wrist.She's average hight and weight but we had to return this for a larger size.

28250,"I wanted to know if this ring is like 2 rings in one, because this ring is beyond gorgeous, I just love it.",2
28289,"I ordered these for my wife for last Valentine's Day. I was VERY disappointed. Very tiny, cheap looking. Looked like they were for a small child. I gave a 2-star rating, but I felt that was too high.
",2
28321,"I brought this bracelet for my girlfriend about two months ago, and she kept snagging the ""U"" on almost everything; her clothing, other bracelets, her hair, and even on me from time to time. Each time the ""U"" on this bracelet got caught in something, it'd slightly bend. Of course you can always bend it back, but after time, tension is going to cause it to just break off.If the person you plan on getting this for isn't going to wear it all the time, like every day, then yes, go ahead and get it for them. If you're quite sure they will wear it a majority of the time, I would suggest looking for another bracelet.
",2
28328,"this bracelet is too small to ware, looks like made for little girl. From the image showed on website, we couldn't tell.
",2
28374,"The quality and the stone setting were good, but the color was dull orange-red and not very easily visible against a tanned skin tone. Not worth it, if you are expecting a deeper rich colored garnet gemstone.
",2
28381,"The garnets are pink, not a deep red like I expected. I personally don't like it. Otherwise, it is a nicely made ring. Also, I am a size 5 and the 7 stones are just too much they hit the sides of my other fingers.

28416,"This Pendant is on the cheap looking side - but you get what you pay for I guess.

28435,"Although the product specifications state that the diamond is IGI certified, a certification does not come with the pendant! Very nice otherwise. Would have 4 stars if it had the certification. I will have it appraised to ensure the quality stated in the specifications is factual before the 30 day return period...just in case.
",2
28461,"It's not nearly the quality I was expecting. First day after washing my hands a few times, it started to turn my finger green. I have to constantly switch where I wear it to avoid this. It's very thin, a flimsy feeling but still cute enough to wear as an accessory when going out.
",2
28478,"This ring is one of three I bought at the same time...the other two fit perfectly, and I wear them daily. This one just doesn't fit correctly. It says it's the right size, but it is either mis-marked or this company's size 7 is different from the standard size. Disappointed in the ring.
",2
28484,"This ring was extremely small. My Husband bought this for me as a ""get out of trouble gift"" and ordered a 10, well, we took it to our jewlers and it was an 8!!!! NOT COOL!
",2
28532,"Although this ring is gorgeous, and very ornate (for such a small ring). There was one drawback. It turned my finger green. I only wear sterling silver or white gold jewelry, and I have many sterling silver rings, none of those rings have turned my finger green. This lead me to believe that the ring was not sterling silver as it states on the website. I would not recommend buying this ring, or any jewelry from the silver insanity company.
",2
28542,"The ring was nice and looked like picture but had a crack in one Garnet and another one had a large chip.
",2
28548,"Although the box was adorably small, the figurines were misshapen. I could have fixed that because I like doing that. Unfortunately the tune ""Jingle Bells"" didn't include the chorus!!! What's Jingle Bells without the chorus? I couldn't fix that so I returned it.
",2
28575,"I had no trouble opening this pillbox, but once I did I had two surprises. First, it was not polished on the inside. And worse, it had a price sticker on it marked $7.90. Deeper and better made is the Frank Lloyd Wirght pillbox for the same price I found on Amazon. Although not sterling silver it is much nicer and appropriately priced.
",2
28605,"its too big and i needed it for my wedding... the seller was right on it then when i wanted to send it back i guess he lost my number! LOL he didnt give me any info to return... soo there it sits in its pretty little box... anyone wanna buy a ring?
",2
28613,"The bracelets are nice.. Didn't break when i put them on.. They are stretchy and would match with any outfit. I love them except they kind of look like they are meant to be worn by a little kid...****After wearing the bracelt the first day I had it, I came home and took it off and it broke to pieces!!*****
",2
28636,"I loved the ring when I received it. The silver stood up to constant wearing without becoming misshapen. The problem I had was the garnet started to crack and break, and it was only from normal wear, not abuse. It looks horrible now. I was very disappointed, since I have only had this ring 4 months.
",2
28639,"This ring was lovely when I first received it, even if the ""garnet"" was orange. This ring was given to me as a promise ring and I wore it every day but I wasn't rough with it. Even though I was gentle, this ring was misshapen and needed to be replaced within two months. I wouldn't recommend wasting money if this ring will mean something to you, but for a little while it made a nice stand-in.
",2
28646,"The ring is not very durable. The ""sterling silver"" is VERY malleable. Which leads me to believe it's not actual silver, but silver plated instead. The ring is pretty and I bought it to match my sister's red garnet celtic cross necklace for her birthday, but the ring did not last more than a month.
",2
28681,"I bought four of these thinking they would be great gifts for several birthdays. They are made OK, however there is no color to the stones. I was disappointed and if I had not been traveling I would have returned them.
",2
28684,"I ordered this ring because it said it was Comfort Fit - but it definitely is NOT.
",2
28690,"I bought the bracelet expecting the stones to look like amethyst. Unfortunately they lack color and almost appear like a very pale rose quartz. It is well constructed and comfortable. Thats about all I can say about it. I was not pleased with this purchase.
",2
28691,"I purchased 3 of these bracelets. The stones in 2 of them were very light which made the bracelets look extremely cheap. The third bracelet had darker stones with just a few lighter stones mixed in. It was much better looking.
",2
28694,"I got this bracelet at a very low price, and still, it's not worth what little I paid for it. The stones are terribly, conspicuously mismatched, ranging from pale lavender to nearly clear with a hint of pink. Some of the stones seem cloudy and don't sparkle at all, even in direct sunlight. On the plus side, the setting seems sturdy and the clasp is secure. The silver has a nice polish to it. But the poor-quality stones ruin it for me, so I'm returning the bracelet for a refund.
",2
28713,"If your looking for sparkle and diamond cut cz's this is not the necklace for you. It has no shine, is very dull. I purchased this for my daughter because of the other reviews but you don't have to. I would never say ""Oh, that is so beautiful"" Very disappointed plus the chain came all in a great big knot which took me over an hour to undo. Pass on this piece of jewelry.
",2
28714,"The product arrived in a ""velvet"" pouch. The chain was in a complete knot and I was unable to untangle. I ended up breaking the chain and purchasing a new one, as there was not time to return before Christmas. I would think twice before purchasing necklaces from Amazon again. Disappointed to say the least.
",2
28717,"I ordered this locket because it specifically said it was for a child, it was cute, and had a short chain. When I received the locket it was so tiny that it was impossible to put any photos inside and was too small to just wear as jewelry. I went back to Amazon and ordered a larger heart locket at the same price. It is just the right size to put two photos inside. It even came with a template to help cut the photos and plastic to hold the photos in place in the locket. I would definitely order more of these for other children in the family. The product code is:Sterling Silver Heart Locket on Cable Chain, 18""
",2
28772,"What a beautiful bracelet! What an ugly clasp! The amethysts are gorgeous, CZ are aparkling, the teardrop shape is very flattering on a wrist. But I could not get over the ugly clasp! One of the teardrop shapes ends short at one end of the braceletand that is where it connects to the other end of the bracelet forming not a very attractive sight. I had to return it, I like everything to be neat, and may be even perfect, too.
",2
28815,"Even from a few feet you can tell these earrings are cloudy with a darkish hue to them. I mean I guess they are decent for a starter set but if you want something impressive, these aren't it.
",2
28822,"The price was too good to be true. Although the size of the diamonds is accurate, they lack sparkle. My CZ's are prettier. Fortunately, these were for my 17 year old daughter. I didn't to spend a great deal in case she lost one. I wouldn't recommend buying any diamonds that fall this low on the color scale.
",2
28827,"After purchasing these for my girlfriend I realize I should have spent twice as much (I believe these were around $90 at my time of purchase). I knew they would be smaller, perhaps better suited for a second hole but I was disappointed by their quality. They aren't very bright or clear. I probably would have been better off buying quality fakes at the same price or less.
",2
28847,"These earrings can be hit or miss. At this quality, flaws are expected, but one would expect the stones to at least match. However, at this size, you can't really tell how off they are unless you're closer up. I received one earring with a little spot in it and the other looked like it was about to bloom with mildew. I just needed something to keep the holes in my ears from closing up and they do the job admirably, but don't get these as a gift for someone special.
",2
28864,"I was looking for some nice jewelry to give our 14 and 16 year old nieces. This is not it. This will end up as a present for the 10 year old niece because we got it at the Friday sale price of $15. The pendant is smaller than the on-screen picture, smaller even than the fingernail on my ,ittle finger, and the stone is so small it is hard to see.If I had paid the $45 they ask for it regularly I would have been even more disappointed and asked for a refund... evven at only $15 I am tempted to send it back.
",2
28882,"When they say small they are not kidding . The peridot pendant was the smallest pendant I have ever seen. I would only consider buying it for the chain for the peridot is a joke..
",2
28916,"I am writing this on my bf account he bought me the bracelet... Sadly enough I think I got a lemon it broke after 3 hours of wearing it on x-mas we decided to send it back and I am in the process of choosing something else... I was sad it broke the links are not very strudy!
",2
28928,"It is a very pretty bracelet, but it broke after 2 weeks. I was lucky enough not to lose it and returned it.
",2
28947,"Shipping was super fast! However, the ring looked pretty cheap. Not terribly so, but still very cheap. The stone in mine was a little lopsided, so that didn't help it much. Overall, a ""meh"".
",2
28972,"I was so excited to receive these earrings. They were smaller than I thought they'd be but I thought, lovely.I wore them twice, then lost one. I'm heartbroken, but vow to never buy anything that doesn't have a more secure backing.Maybe you'd love it but I'm disappointed...mostly at myself.
",2
28991,"Sadly, There was not sufficient warning that the earrings were so small. They hardly show on a person with long dark hair.The quality didn't look as nice as in the photo on line. I will not buy jewelry on line again.
",2
28998,"Product doesn't match the picture and they are very light weight and small. They do not sparkle and lack a quality appearance. The smoky quartz color is very dull in appearance and the gold setting makes them look very ordinary. Small earrings can look so much nicer than this one.
",2
29009,"I was very disappointed in the purple color of the earrings when they finally arrived. The amethyst isn't the rich purple portrayed by Amazon. It's pretty washed-out looking. If I hadn't waited 2 months for them and if they weren't only $60, I would return them. However, under those circumstances, it would be more trouble than it's worth. I've bought other gemstones online and they were very true to the onscreen color. This is my first big disappointment.
",2
29012,"...These earrings are very beautiful, but too small for an adult--they are child-size. I returned them for this reason. (Amazon: you should consider posting an actual-size photo for all jewelry.)
",2
29013,"WOW, I must have gotten different earings than everyone else! These are TINY. I was expecting the pear to be completely below the lobe and they are NOT! I don't have large ears either.Color is beautiful, construction quality is great, but I was expecting something more substantial!
",2
29021,"The earrings color was not green. It was an indefinable color; really light not green or clear. The earrings size was acceptable.I returned the earrings because I couldn't match with anything.
",2
29025,"I really liked the photo of these earrings online, so I made my husband happy by ordering my own birthday present. Upon receipt, I was very disappointed that one earring is a dark amethyst and the other earring is much, much lighter. I almost kept them because of the lovely style and excellent craftsmanship, but I sent them back for a refund. Now, unfortunately, my husband feels that he has to go shopping for a present for me!
",2
29038,"It was nice for the price; but not enough color. Darker in picture. Not sure I am keeping it.
",2
29053,"The photo is deceptive. The diamonds are microscopic, and the gold chain as thin as a strand of hair. The moon is depicted as hanging by one end with the angel ""sitting"" upright, but the chain is attached to both ends of the moon, making it look like a ""U"". I gave it as a gift to my daughter, but we will have to get a better chain before this one breaks.
",2
29060,"When I purchased these on August 18, there was not a picture of the item. Part of this is my fault for not being familiar with green amethyst and for buying something sight unseen. However, I don't think it was unreasonable of me to expect some definitive green. The description says that this stone is part of the quartz family; think quartz here with a washed out greyish green color. The picture, which is now posted, is fairly accurate but more definitive in color than what you will receive. They are also larger than I anticipated. The minimum total gem weight is listed as 1.74 carats, which would be roughly .87 carat per earring. My earrings present to be about 1.5 to 2 carats each, which means they are pretty large, probably due to the fact that this stone is fairly lightweight. The tip of the pear to the bottom is 3/8 inch. Amazon ran these on special for $20.99, on a percentage off sale, but if I had this to do over, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for them, although the gold housing on the stones is probably worth the price I paid. In my opinion, they are not suitable for gift giving either.
",2
29071,"One of the pearls fell out of the setting the second I took it out of the packaging. It was glued in. It is a pretty ring...but I guess you get what you pay for
",2
29077,"I'm not sure if this is real hematite, because it is not magnetic. Other hematite that I have purchased from other sellers is magnetic. I also do not like the way it looks. It looks cheap, and you can see the seam where it was glued together. It does not look right. I would not wear this item, but I do not have time right now to worry about re-packaging it and sending it back, so I guess I will just have to consider it a loss. Other than that, shipping was fast, and there were also no problems with packaging... just did not like the item.

29233,"I have rather slim wrists and this bracelet fit perfectly. The beads are very nice and smooth and I enjoyed very much wearing it for the Thirty minutes I did wear it. The quality of the string for this bracelet is embarrassing. This bracelet popped off less than 30 minutes after I first put it on, and when I say popped off I mean the string snapped and the beads went flying. I have not yet contacted the seller, as I'm most likely to just buy some stretch string at a Craft Store. For the price I love having this nice set of Onyx beads, and the string will be cheap to replace. Other than the poor quality of the string, this is a great bracelet. (BUY EXTRA STRING).

29319,"In the description it calls the 18 mm tigereye gemstone a sphere when it probably should be called a bead because that's what it is. There's a hole that goes all the way through it. It probably won't matter to most but it bothered me. I was expecting a solid sphere.

29321,"While this is a beautiful piece of jewlery and my experiences with Silver Insanity have been great - it is HUGE! I expected the ""ball"" would be the size of a marble, but it is the size of a jaw breaker. It does state the size in the description, but I guess I just didn't read it. So , I will be sending mine back.

29329,"I love geckos and thought the ring was awesome so I got it and found that the ring was very big. I ordered a size too small on purpose so I could put it on my pinkie but it's on my thumb because it is huge! Also the ring rips your clothing, bags, or blankets. The feet get caught on the fabric and rip it. I eventually had to completely stop wearing it because it was causing me so many problems.

",2
29371,"I bought this because it reminded me of my father, who played french horn when he was in high school. It came on a necklace that wouldn't even fit over my head. It was THAT small of a necklace...maybe it'll fit a kid or an infant, but definitely not an adult. Plus the band does not come apart without me having to take a pair of scissors and cut the band. There is no clip-type fastener. The french horn itself feels like it's made out of plastic or some other light weight material. If you are looking for a nice piece of jewelry, I do not recommend this piece.

",2
29385,"Overall the ring looks fine, I think its colorful in good way. However, when I received the ring the middle stone moved. Now I'm left to either pay more to ship it back and hope for a new ring to be returned (hoping it will be made well), or I must have a professional fix it. Either way I don't think its worth any more money to return, or to get fixed. If they would have sent me a good ring that was made well(without moving stones), I would have enjoyed the ring (now its a pain.)
",2
29390,"I must admit I was disappointed with the ring. Much darker than the picture. The edge of the ring was not smooth at all. Extremely light. Almost the feel and look of a ring you might get out of a bubble gum machine. Not what I expected titanium to be like.GP

29410,"Its a really nice ring, seems durable, ive had it for two hours and i put it on and the edges are so sharp, maybe my fingers are more webbed then normal but it hurts to much to wear :( so nice.. but oh well.. i recommend to any female interested.. it looks like a male ring... its dosent mean it is, but its as thick as a male ring and it has a more masculine look. also the edges hurt so when thinking about buying this, take into consideration its not ganna wear well on your fingers... other then that, i wish i could wear it.

29433,"For my tast this item was to large for me and there were no size of the item when I bought this.
",2
29465,"The item I received is not the same color or shape to what is pictured online. The product was also delayed in shipping, which was addressed by customer service in a timely fashion. I'm mostly dissatisfied that the color of the stone is so different, which is a deep blue with small hint of green. I bought it as a present for my girl friend as opal is her birthstone. I've looked through literally hundreds of earrings and now I'm not even confident I'm giving her her birthstone. If it wasn't a time concern, I'd promptly return the earrings I received.
",2
29498,"I guess it's my own fault. I should have read the product details more closely. I was very shocked when I opened the little blue pouch and found that the necklace was smaller than a dime. I ordered two of these and I'm pretty sure I'm going to send them both back. The pendant is appropriately sized for a child, but the necklace is really too delicate to be a children's piece of jewelry. The product details clearly state the size of the necklace, and I know it's my own fault for not reading it, but I would have never thought an adult piece of jewelry would be so tiny. In addition to the tiny size, the pendant is stamped on one side. Several of the reviews say it twists when worn, and the stamp is very noticeable.
",2
29505,"One side of the pendant is stamped with the silver mark. The way it hangs on the chain, the pendant flips over constantly, so you can see the stamp. We're sending it back!

29679,"Ordered 3 pair of these earrings, to use as gifts. Out of a total of 6 earrings, 2 were not glued completely to the posts, at danger of falling off posts, but these pearls were good, very minor blemishes, almost flawless. Two were very severly blemished on the front, most visible part of the pearls, with many dents and bumps. Two had dark spots, swirls and blemishes, again on the front of the pearls. None were near as pristine as in the picture. The blemishes/dark areas were visible from across the room. The good thing is that the posts and backs were solid and secure. Also, Akoya pearls have a nice, lustrous sheen. Returned for refund, as I would not want to give these as a gift to someone I liked. With Amazon jewelry, it is real hit or miss. I'm glad they are good about returns. Thanks Amazon! Very disappointed.
",2
29710,"I was gifted these earrings for Christmas 2007. They were very beautiful and I wore them everyday. After 5 months one of the pearls broke off the post. They are nice looking, however they don't seem to be well made.
",2
29719,"These were ordered as a gift, so I spent some time deciding which size would look the best on the recipient. I ordered the 6.5-7.0 mm, but what I received was (according to Amazon's own scale and then measured with a metric ruler) was 5.5-6.0 mm. Two sizes smaller than what I ordered! While the pearls were very nice, I was disappointed with the small size and am returning the earrings.
",2
29721,"Don't buy!! Looks pink in picture and bigger, turns out they were small and white, not what I wanted or expected at all.

",2
29924,"I am pleased with the pendant but very dissatisfied with it as a necklace. In its description it clearly says, and I quote, ""Comes ready to wear with a jewelry black rope necklace"", well only if you have an EXTREMELY small head. The small black rope doesn't open nor adjust, making it absolutely impossible to wear it as a necklace! I bought this as a gift for my graduating piano student and won't be able to use it.

29929,"These earring are very cute, maybe sophisticated too.They are simple and classic in design.The only flaw of these earrings is that the Hinge cannot take Extended wear.I began to find them on the floor,( my girlfriend did sleep with them on (that's how comfortable they are )I recommend you buy a few pairs, they're very inexpensive and especially if you like the look.

29942,"If you like folks squinting and asking you ""whats that supposed to be?"" then this is the pendant for you. Its rather small to the point where the features are not noticable, and its very light. If it were larger I think I'd of liked it. It would make for a good ""charm"" persay, for a bracelet perhaps though. To each 'is own.
",2
29974,"I'd like to point out that the good reviews for this ring weren't from the person who actually wears this ring. The feet are VERY sharp and I have also have scars from her feet and forget trying to get into your pocket wearing it. I tried wearing the fairy in both directions but now just have scars in two places on my finger. Don't get me wrong, I loved this ring! It's super cute but I'm not sure it's worth the injury. I ended up filing down her feet and that seems to have helped for now.
",2
29980,"I bought this ring, I thought it was pretty, until I got it home. They should inform you that the feet of the fairy are like a dagger! I have multiple scars on my finger where its gouged me, and I have a 3 inch scar up my knee where the feet ripped thru my pants and into my knee! I had it in my pocket so I could use the restroom. I was going to send it back but I dont know the info was, so I left it on my desk at work hoping someone would steal it, no luck so far.
",2
29991,"I am pretty sure I asked for an 18 inch chain and I received what might be a 14inch chain. All that aside, it is a lovely chain, nice quality for the price, fairly sturdy, good clasp. Be careful in requesting your size.
",2
29997,"Light in weight and light in color chain. You get what you pay for. It's a perfect ""I don't really know you but, here's a little something"" gift or for a child.

30025,"I had one of these before but it was from another maker ofcourse, the one i had was the correct size, it had markings on both sides and the quality was waayyy better. This one feels cheap, it's too light and the chains breaks extremely fast.

30040,"I just got the item in today after waiting almost 2weeks after I purchased it. For the price you pay its not exactly as nice as you expect. For a small jewlery box its poorly finished, on the inside you can see glue all over where they put it together and on the outside there are bubbles from what I can only assume is the nails holding the wood together. The latch on the front doest fit snug at all nor does it line up quite right. Im quite dissapointed I do not suggest this to anyone looking for a small Asian inspired jewlery box or anything of the sort.
",2
30041,"Not quite those expensive lacquer boxes you might find in import stores and boutiques. The sides seams were splitting and were coming off when it arrived, making it useless as a Christmas present. I am not sure how they're sourcing these, but you get what you pay for in this case.

30142,"much smaller tham i thought these would be. hardly can see the stones, i've never worn them, but too much of a hassle to send back! buyer beware!

30151,"I ordered these as a gift they looked so pretty online and they got good reviews so I decided to purchase them. BIG mistake!! They are very cheap looking. I realize I didn't pay that much for them but I could have Bought a $5 pair and they would've looked nicer!! You can tell on the earrings where the stone has been molded into the other part of the earring...absolutely horrible!! The reviews for it have to be fake! I have learned my lesson not to buy jewelry online.

30191,"I waited too long for delivery. It took nearly 2 weeks for me to received a shipment that supposedly shipped the same or next day. I received a ring that was much larger in size than the order specified, and the band was bent. I requested a size 10, and the bandwidth of the item I received exceeded the size 10 bandwidth on the ring sizing chart.I returned the ring via certified mail and requested an exhange. The return was confirmed received on Friday 3 August. The vendor kindly informed me that the order would be processed and shipped on Monday 6 August. Except for the flawed band & wrong size, I like the design and alloy. But if this order takes more than a week to receive, I will not purchase from this merchant again because the delivery time does not justify the original shipping cost. Moreover, if the exchange is sized incorrectly or the band is bent, I will request a refund.

30297,"Initially I was happy until my son wore them for a few months. Then I wasn't really impressed with them. Yes, they looked nice and sparkly. BUT they turned my son's ears a nasty color. I had to buy another pair of Sterling Silver ones somewhere else for roughly a couple of dollars more and they have Not turned my son's ears strange colors. Makes me wonder what kind of ""Sterling Silver"" they were.
",2
30358,"Bought these earrings but they were different sizes and unacceptable as gifts. Also, as best as I can tell there is no such thing as a quadruple A rating for pearls. Would not buy again and shame on Amazon for serving this to its customers.
",2
30473,"The item is described as ""10 mm Pink Genuine Pearl..."" These are NOT genuine pearls. These are simulated pearls. Swarovski does make simulated pearls, these might be those simulated pearls or other simulated pearls. Quite honestly, considering the description is inaccurate, I doubt the crystal is even really Swarovski elements. It feels much more plastic-like than my genuine Swarovski items. The earrings are cute, but not the deal you might think considering the misleading title.I own three other pairs of pink pearl earrings, and bought these to replace a pair that was lost. Although these are nice, they don't quite wow me like I thought they would considering all the five star reviews.
",2
30497,"This piece appears better crafted in the image than it actually is. It is poor quality sterling at best. The details are rounded and not cleanly etched. For the price I expected much better in such a small piece. I do enjoy the design but wear it more often as a lapel pin than a pendant. Service was speedy but don't get this item if you want fine detail.
",2
30504,"This ring is pretty cool looking, but the problem is that it is fragile. I dropped it in the bathroom after I washed my hands, and it broke into five diffrent pieces. If you insisst on buying this ring I would suggest that you take extra care of it, and be very careful.
",2
30510,"It was exactly as described, and fit one of my fingers really well. It shipped fast, and I was really pleased at how gorgeous it was.I had previously purchased one except that it was thicker. I wore it for a while, about a few months or so, until it broke. I had slapped my hand down on the concrete, and it just crumbled to pieces. My boss remarked at how fragile hematite was, and I had never realized that. So, I suppose I shouldn't have purchased one in the first place. But I think they're really pretty.The quality, however, isn't all that great. I purchased this one (my second one), and it broke later that night, actually cutting my finger and I still have a very small shard imbeded into my skin. :\It's pretty, I like it, but it's SO fragile.
",2
30517,"The ring looks very nice, but the quality is not so nice. This was the second time I have purchased this ring for my husband. He is a man that talks with his hands, both times he was pointing to something on a table and voila, the ring broke into many pieces. Needless to say we are going to get a quality metal this time. If you are gentle with your hands, this ring may work. It is a nice looking ring, but you get what you pay for.
",2
30524,"i got this for my husband after he lost his wedding band. at first it was really nice and he got a lot of compliments. about a month after getting it he was at practice for Honor Guard doing movements on a rifle. He tapped his hand against the rifle and the ring shattered.I also got myself one which i do still have, but do not wear. It hasn't broken because i don't work with my hands, but the appearance isn't very good anymore. It starts to get prints all over it that just won't come off.

30526,"i wore this ring only twice i dropped it and it broke into 3 pieces.
",2
30551,"Very disappointed. I also purchased 2 other colors, and those were well-made and gorgeous, but the Bamboo Coral Chip earrings were full of little holes (therefore the swiss cheese comparison) and glaring imperfections. There is no way I'd wear them, so I tossed in the trash. I could have returned them, but they are so cheap that the shipping cost alone would have made the return not worth it. Overall, no big deal. It's a shame since the red color is so pretty.
",2
30560,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. At first it looked great ... then she wore it. Even though she did nothing rough while wearing it to cause any damage, the ring became misshapen very quickly and easily, and one of the aquamarine stones fell out within three weeks. This may have been from how the ring went out of shape but neither should have happened to easily and quickly. Quite disappointed. I would suggest looking elsewhere for an aquamarine ring and save yourself the money and disappointment.

30579,"Item arrived with a missing stone and one of the hoop hinges did not lock tightly. Terribly disappointing as the earrings were beautiful.

30607,"I think this fell apart within a day. I thought it would be a good idea, and I think it looks cool, but it is plastic and it doesn't stay together well so it just fell out too quickly. Seller is good, just this particular product is cheap. Thanks!

30631,"I got this locket as a gift for he holidays. When I got it I was shocked to say the least. First thing I noticed was the general look of the piece, which to be honest seemed off in comparison to the picture. The inside of the locket was the second thing. It was blank in the locket, just an ugly metallic look. Third thing that, in the end made me return the item, was clasp that held the door of the locket closed. To be blunt it didn't work. All in all I give the item a 2, only for the fact that it is technically a locket with pretty stones on it.
",2
30635,"wow I never thought I'd have to write a review about a lapel but this one sure needs it. I love the look of it and I love that it has all 50 stars and 13 stripes but golly it sure fails in every duty of a lapel. The back of it falls off without even pulling on it. I tried to bend it a bit but it made no difference. I ended up just bending the needle flat and that stayed for all of two days 'till it fell off and now it's gone for good. I had it for about one week.
",2
30655,"These would indeed be worth 5-stars except that the photo shows that they are not ""mirrored"" earrings- the left and right ears are not supposed to have the same earring when the design is assymetrical. Fine jewelery earrings are supposed to be ""mirrored"".
",2
30667,"If you're a restaurant hostess, a hotel front-desk clerk, or the type of person who gets dressed, drives to work, sits at a desk at your computer, and drives home, this ring will be fine for you. I love the look of this ring and the art glass colors are beautiful, but I lost the pink glass ball the FIRST day I wore this ring. It was nice and tight in the tension band, but even sticking your hand in your pocket or unbuckling your toddler from a car seat can scrape the ball out of the setting. I have since tried to wear the other colors and am now down to just three of the five colors. I try to be mindful of the fact that the ring sits high off the finger and the ball can pop out pretty easily, but have still lost two of the balls. Sometimes, the ball will pop out and I'll notice it right then and recover it. But the last one I lost was while unloading groceries (either from my cart into the trunk, or from the trunk into the house), so I have no idea where the little ball may be. This is a great idea, but I have another ""changeable stones"" ring that grasps the stone much more securely, so I wear that one a lot more often.
",2
30672,"I loved the photo, and the price!When I opened the box, I was disappointed that both earrings had inclusions on the top of the table (top of the stone) which were quite visible with only my eye. I am not a diamond expert and do not know if the price was good for this item or not. However, I purchased the earrings thinking they would look like the photo and these clearly were not the earrings used for the promotional photograph. I would not have wanted the earrings if I had seen them prior to placing the order. I returned them and had no problem receiving a refund.
",2
30682,"I was looking for a dainty, CZ bracelet that looked real. Didn't want one that was too large, hence, obviously fake looking as I'm getting out of my Toyota minivan and not my Mercedes : ) I had a bracelet a few years ago (lost--so upset!) that had a CZ carat weight that was very small, quality of bracelet was excellent, and it passed for real without being ostentatious. I thought this bracelet fit the bill. After receiving bracelet in the mail and opening the box, I was very disappointed. It alternates between bezel set and prong set. The bezel set CZ's looked nice, but the prong set CZ's were a mess: Some of the prongs were opened (CZ's eventually going to falling out), some too smooshed in, and some bent sideways. The weight was extremely light, yes, it is a small bracelet, but it was featherweight. The coloring of the metal was very, very, white, hence, very, very fake. I would value this bracelet at maybe $12.99. It is similar to a piece of costume jewelry you would see on a counter display at Target or some other inexpensive retail store. I can't believe this bracelet originally retailed for $75., then was reduced to final price (what I paid for it) of $50.I am in the process of returning it. Stinks that I now have to pay to insure this piece of junk and pay for shipping to send it back, Very disappointed and do not recommend this bracelet for what they are asking for it--way overpriced!!!

30700,"These earrings looked perfect in the picture. They were well shaped and not too big. I am not a fan of large earrings. Their only failing is that they don't match in color. One of the earrings is almost black and the other is a little darker than royal blue. When you put them together, it looks like you put on one earring each from a different set. I have even had comments. I would say that you need to look for a different manufacturer that does a better job of matching the earring pair.
",2
30728,"I ordered this item a while ago. it got to me in a reasonably timely manner, so I have no complaints about THAT.shipping costs were pretty high.the Pendant itself is GORGEOUS, but the chain is cheap and tacky. I'm going to have to purchase a sterling silver chain that will compliment the Pendant, without turning brown. but I really wanted the Pendant. so I'll get another chain that won't tarnish, but will show it off.actually, they would have been better off to sell the Pendant without a chain.

But I still think a seller should be HONEST in their description to save us the trouble of purchasing, mailing back, and waiting for a refund.These earrings should not have been described as SI2-I1. There were a few black specks in the diamonds that were VERY visable to the naked eye. Not alot of sparkle in them, but I would've kept them if they didn't have the black specks.They did provide a full refund,so i guess I can't complain too much.

30949,"The key is designed wonderfully, but, sadly, its construction doesn't hold up so well... very prone to bending and (eventually) breaking. I'll be looking for a sturdier replacement.

30968,"This is a perfect gift for a teenager, it's a nice size and very pretty.After a few months it looks awful, it's so tarnished. Obviously not the best quality.
",2
30984,"The butterfly was larger than I expected. Mine didn't come with a chain, but perhaps it wasn't supposed to. The piece felt hollow. I would call it molded rather than crafted. Diamond chips were barely visible. Sorry, but it was cheap looking. I would never give as a gift. This company has been great with returns (plus their gift boxes are very nice), so I know there will be no problem returning.
",2
30988,"this ring is very pretty, fit and sizing was excellent, shipping speed was great, however, after a few weeks of wearing, the metal has a grainy texture and is turning dull. it appears that it is not real silver. i am also allergic to many other metals besides silver and i cannot wear the ring because my finger breaks out in hives. maybe the silver coat is wearing off? i am disappointed in the product and wish i would have invested in a more quality ring.
",2
31087,"I bought them and they are smaller than they looked. I still have them and have never worn them. They are too small, like they would be for a child. I waited too long to return them, so I'm stuck with them. They are pretty, I might give them to some little girl some day.
",2
31091,"They were much smaller than it looks in the picture! They are for kids! I didn't return them because maybe I'll find a little girl to give them to.

31092,"Was incredibly disappointed after opening the box and the lovely blue drawstring bag they came in only to find itty bitty earrings. They look cheap and disposable. Gave them two stars because they would be a cute gift for a kid.

31100,"I typically have great experiences with Amazon, however this time was not so great. The earrings were way smaller then I expected, to the point they became less noticeable then I desired. Fragility of them also seemed to be an issue.Upon the return, the postal service (USPS) took over two weeks for it to get to Amazon...or Amazon dragged their feet. I'm not sure when they received the return.Shipping to me was typical Prime, no damage to it.
",2
31120,"Unfortunately when this item arrived it turned out to be only 3mm gauge bands as opposed to the description which has the bands at 5mm each. I contacted the seller suggesting that they had dispatched the wrong item as they also have listed a 3mm version but they assured me that I had received the correct item and suggested that if I was not happy with it to return it for a refund - which I have done. I find it odd that the seller is unaware of the anomaly in the description and then to assure me the item is correct when it is clearly not as described - go look for yourself!Sterling Silver Russian Wedding 3 Band Ring

31132,"It is a lovely ring to look at, but the stone fell off after only a few days! :-(

31242,"I ordered earrings and they never arrived. After two weeks, I inquired and was told they would ship them ""again"" ASAP. Another two weeks went by, and still nothing. However, once I requested a refund, that was promptly processed within 48 hours. That's the only thing positive that happened in this experience.
",2
31258,"This item was poorly constructed, damaged during shipping or both. Had the item cost half as much, I would have expected this. For an item that will cost over $20.00 by the time it's shipped to you, and only consist of a few wires and metal bands, the least you could expect is an appearance that it was put together carefully. The large wire scroll like frame appears racked and thus makes the metal bands all look bent. Painted finish was so thin that it was already rubbed through in several places when we received the item. It will do the job but should have cost much less for the quality.
",2
31259,"this was supposed to be new, not used. but when this arrived in the box, the silver was chipped in 3-4 places and there are scratches on it right out of the box!! it looks like i have had it for years with the wear and tear on it the way it arrived.the design is nice, and i would like to keep it. but the coating is so poor that it looks too tacky to display with all the chip marks.

31322,"I love these guages, so much. I expected to get both gauges as in a PAIR seeing as usually you'd pay anywhere from $14.00-$20.00 for gauges that come in pairs. That was why I decided to pay $24.00 (without shipping) for a nice SET of gauges but when this one arrived, I was dissappointed in myself for not actually reading what the description of this product was but more dissappointed in Pierce This 2 for putting up a picture of the gauges AS A SET making it seem like someone ordering could get both gauges. (For someone to order just one is weird because no one gauges just one ear.) My advice? Pierce This 2, please either change the picture or sell them both for the price you'd like because I made a mistake, yes, but yours is very unreasonable. Thankssss (:

31328,"For a medical alert charm, I think this one is too small. In the enlarged picture it looks great - real life it it hard to read... What is A * T??? you have to guess that it would mean Allergic To, but in a medical emergency, do you really want them guessing???

31371,"I pruchased this for my daughter for Christmas and while it looks nice and has a nice weight to it, the chain broke in a matter of days. She didn't snag it or pull on it, it just simply fell off her neck as she was eating dinner. Now I have to take it to a jeweler to have a new chain put on it.
",2
31388,"the ring doesn't look like the same ring from the picture. the black detail in non existent, and the stone is very dull, and has none of the blue hue shown in the picture, mine looks just like glass. i was so excited when i ordered it, but extremely disappointed when it arrived.

31394,"I just received this locket, which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x-mas, and had to decline on giving it to her. when i received it, i actually thought Amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in. I shook the bag, felt for the necklace, and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant. it's so small, i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself. i was very disappointed. other then the size and over priced tag, i thought it was cute - but i will be returning it.sorry!

31410,"I ordered this charm because it looks like a Siamese cat, but the one I received is much less detailed. It still is obviously a cat, but did not match the picture.
",2
31430,"I was really looking forward to receiving these earrings, but was very disappointed when I received them. Although they were pretty to look at, functionally they were useless. The sterling silver they are made from seems very flimsy and they have NO latch on them, which means you have to force them open to try to get them on. I had to return them because I was worried I would break them trying to put them on. It's a shame, because they looked so nice. One earring was also slightly larger than the other.
",2
31440,"I was not happy when I received these earrings as they are too small to handle with acrylic nails. If I had made it to the postoffice they would have sent them back.
",2
31480,"The item is nice, but a lot smaller and not as nice as it looks in the picture. Not worth the money
",2
31481,"The pendant is very pretty and a nice size although the amethysts are very pale in color. The chain is worthless. It is thinner than dental floss and will break the first time it gets caught in anything. The clasp is very cheap and opens unevenly making it difficult to close. If you buy this, plan on purchasing a more substantial chain to wear it on.

31579,"The part that you put through your earlobe was too tight so by the end of day my earlobe was sore.
",2
31649,"I purchased expecting something of a reasonable weight...I was wrong. What I got was VERY thin and felt cheap. The lettering on mine was hardly readable because the background was tarnished (that I fixed with a polishing cloth). Perhaps for the price I had higher epectations than I should have, but I was just not impressed.
",2
31665,"This is the second time I've written this review as the first one was removed for some reason.The earrings did not have near the luster of the ""stock photo"" that is shown on Amazon. I have added two pictures of them to show you what they looked like. The pearls seems more like plastic beads or some sort of costume jewelry rather than something that would make you think ""pearl"".Everything was ""cheap"" about the earrings from the actual price of them to the packaging of them.I know this review probably seems overly harsh given the price of the items, but I was severely disappointed in the purchase as I felt it was a complete waste of money. The only reason I did not give this one star is because the price being as low as it is I guess I should have known better.
",2
31683,"This delicate charm is dainty with small diamonds. However, within 2 weeks the last diamond on the row at the base of the crown fell out leaving a gaping hole. Then yesterday the charm ""snapped""off its hinge making it unusable.

31700,"Hey well i bought this for my girl and omg it's broke in one day. It's cute. But i think they skipped on the real hard metal. Actually I think that they just was like hey i'm going to use foal for this one. So now i have two pieces and super glue. wish me luck....

31709,"This Ankh is definitely of poorer quality than expected. The anhk itself is lightweight, almost like it is plastic coated with silver or silver paint. It is molded, with a mold line around the middle. The ""925"" mark is on the clasp/bail and there is nothing on the anhk itself to indicate that anything other than the clasp/bail is silver.... Not very impressed.

31710,"I bought this product approximately two months ago. It's been a great necklace, I have received many compliments. A decent piece of jewelry. A silver cleaner fixed the nasty discoloration I had all over it. Good as new.I'd say 5 stars, but since it won't let me edit the stars, I can only tell you this should be a 5 star review.This is a decent and good looking piece of jewelry.

31713,"Looks cool but its hallow and wears bad. Im afraid it will break easily. Wish it was a solid piece for the price.

31730,"I had these for maybe 4 months before the stone fell out of one of them. Of course, not being able to find the stone, I could not have them repaired.
",2
31731,"This bracelet is actually really nice, but too bad it is so cheaply made that mine broke in about 2 weeks. It's easily fixed all I need is to get new end-clasps and attach them to the leather braid, but I was hoping for a better made product.
",2
31742,"This necklace is incredibly cute! When I received it, I immediately jotted something down and put it in the box. However, the lid will not stay closed when worn! I have not been able to wear it again since the box hangs from the hinge on the lid, wide open.
",2
31753,"I bought this fairy bracelet because my niece loves Tinkerbell. I loved the fact that the fairy has a kind of stone on the wings. So I bought one of each, a fairy with red wings, green, blue, well you get the idea. I regret buying them because the actual bracelet feels and looks like stainless steel instead of having a silver look. It reminds me of something that you can buy at a hardware store. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Bottom line- cute concept but poorly made.

31769,"Its a very pretty ring but within days of receiving it the coating wore off it to show the brass underneath.. Not happy at all! Rated 2 stars because it is very pretty

31778,"Look, highly impure titanium should be as hard or harder than glass. Commercial grade titanium should be slightly below diamond hardness. The hardness of this grade of titanium is that of about mild steel. I don't know what they mixed this titanium with, but it scratches very easily. I wanted a ring that would be hard and resist scratching. This thing scratches MUCH easier than my 18k white gold wedding ring. How this could possibly be actual titanium, I don't know. Frankly, for the price I paid, its not worth the hassle of sending it back, but I would recommend not buying this ring. I consider the cost of this ring a learning experience for me. Don't trust something just because it says ""Titanium"" on it. Find out what the hardness of the ring is before you buy it.The hardness of metals surfaces in the arbitrary MOHS scale (1 = hardness of Talc surface; 10 = hardness of Diamond surface) are, in increasing order: Aluminum = 2 to 2.9; Gold (pure) = 2.5 to 3 (typically 2.75); Silver (pure) = 2.5 to 4 (typically 3.25); Platinum (pure) = 4.3; Glass = 5 to 6; Titanium = 5 to 6 (strongly impurity dependent); SS = 5 to 8.5; Platinum-Iridium (950) = 6.5; Quartz = 7; Titanium nitride (TiN) = 9; Diamond (C) = 10In Brinell Hardness scale: Aluminum (99+) = 23-44; Gold (pure) = 28-48; Silver (99.9%+) = 30-90; Tantalum = 55-123; Platinum (commercial) = 65-101; Silver (sterling, 92.5%) = 65-125; Platinum (10% rhodium) = 79-169; Platinum (10% Iridium) = 104-169; Gold (white 18K) = 211-323; Titanium (commercial) = 200; Titanium (5 Al-2.5Sn) = 34 (RockwellC); SS = 160-400.

31801,"This was an attractive pin and lived up to its description, except how small it was. Yes, it is my fault I did not pay closer attention to the size of the pin, but be aware it is tiny. Maybe the size of a quarter. This small size will not work for my intended use so needless to say I am returning it.

",2
31925,"Had to return these because they are too tiny. basically 1/4 ct TOTAL weight means both earrings together. Not bad for a 2 year old girl, a nose ring or extra ear rings but not really practical for regular ear rings.

31941,"I ordered this on a whim and was very disappointed when it arrived. It's very cheap-looking and the clasp broke the first time I put the necklace on. I tried fixing the clasp, and then the chain broke.Don't waste your money. It's a piece of junk.

31942,"wonderful up until the diamond..probably the most impure diamond ive seen in my life.was embarrased to give to loved one

31960,"I didn't see anything on the product that gave the dimensions as being so huge. I was expecting a cute little choker and got a monstrosity of a thing that I'd never wear. The medallion is the size of my palm!Because the necklace was so cheap, however, it wasn't worth it to send it back. I simply removed the medallion and wear the multistrand part of the necklace.Just be warned that there is nothing cute or little about this necklace!
",2
31963,"This ring looks much better in the photographs than in person. Colors are dull and dirty and in less than 2 months the majority of the sliver had worn off leaving a dull and dingy band. The only decent thing I can say is that it arrived promptly.
",2
31974,"This product worked extremely well -- that is, while it was working. After 3 months it stopped turning on when you pressed the button.That being said, it did a wonderful job cleaning channel set baguette and round stones. It really removed the grime between and left the wedding band and engagement rings sparkling like new. My husband also used to clean his glasses in it, and it also worked well on my water resistant stainless watch with diamond accents. The capacity on this cleaner is a plus.I was truly disappointed that the machine ceased working, but this time around will probably try another product with a higher average rating than this one.
",2
31977,"I bought this item a few years ago and then it just stopped working. First it wouldn't shut off, then it stopped all together. I would not recommend this item.

31981,"Haier HU335W Ultrasonic Cleaner cleans gold really great. It doesn't do much of anything for silver which really disappointed me because I have lots of silver that is really tarnished. I ran the silver through numerous times with a few drops of detergent, as recommended. It remained tarnished. Gold, on the other hand, looks like it just came from the jewelry store. Not so sure its worth the money. Try another manufacturer.
",2
31988,"This is an inexpensive, good looking, and efficient enough cleaner, but may have very limited life due to faulty components. I've purchased three of these, and know now it was a poor investment. The first stopped working after 5 months, and thinking it just bad luck, bought two more; one, I gave as a gift and reportedly is still working, but the second stopped working for me after almost a year of regular use. It works well, but you'll take your chances with this unit.
",2
32012,"I'm wearing plastic InvisAlign ""aligners"" on my teeth (adult orthodontics) and was using this (so called) ultrasonic ""cleaner"" on them. First off, it has a timer that keeps the ""cleaner"" on for about three minutes. I quickly learned that three minutes was never getting the job done. So I developed a routine of hitting the button every time I passed for about a half hour each evening. Even this wasn't doing a complete job and I ended up scrubbing them with a toothbrush every few days. Thankfully this ""cleaner"" just stopped working one day (bought is in March -- died in October -- 7 month lifespan). Now I'll try getting one that actually does its job.
",2
32013,"I purchased the HU335W Ultrasonic Cleaner to use with my hobbies and expected it to make small part cleaning easier. The primary use was to be cleaning knobs and other parts from antique radio equipment. After several cleaning cycles, I still had to clean the knobs manually with a toothbrush. I also tried to use it to clean my razor with similar results. I tried to clean coins with no noticable results. The ""buzzing"" sound it makes when running makes me think it is not really running at ultrasonic speeds. It seems to be well made and is an attractive design that is reasonably priced. It did a reasonable job of cleaning my toothbrush. I would reccommend buying a more expensive unit and leaving this one on the shelf.
",2
32031,"It's not a bad item but doesn't really work like described. Several cycles are needed in order to clean an item and some additional brushing might be required. It's just OK.
",2
32041,"I purchased this product to clean my Invisilign retainers. It did an okay job for almost a year but then it died on me. This equipment might be a good idea for occasional use but not everyday. Reliability is not there yet!.
",2
32049,"I guess you get what you pay for. The diamonds were discolored, some looked gray - almost black and if that was not bad enough some were severely scratched. I would have returned it but not worth the hassle. I gave it two stars because from FAR it actually looks OK but upon close examination you notice all the flaws.
",2
32057,"These are pretty earrings but I also feel the picture is misleading. I appreciate the picture posted by Starsage: it's a good representation of the earrings. I'm sending these back because they just weren't what I expected.
",2
32094,"I got this when i found out I was pregnant 6 month after having my belly button pierced and I didn't want any chance of it closing up. It is too long and the balls on the end just fell off. It was just odd to wear. Ended up just getting a normal belly button ring that was a bit longer and took it out for delivery and but it back in afterwards and worked much better than this product.

32114,"Metal part of earrings on back hollow. Overall quality inferior to that which I assumed. Should have assumed poor quality since were only $40. May yet return, purchased as a gift.
",2
32194,"I bought these cloths based on the customer reviews and truly wished to use them to clean some silver jewellery and a repouss&eacute; silver teapot. I found the cloths extremely stiff, and in fact abandoned cleaning a chain necklace as the cloth did not soften and I was afraid the necklace would break. I then used the cloth to clean a very tarnished repouss&eacute; tea pot and it did get the pot pretty clean, but the effort to work that cloth because it was stiff (until it turned black from removing the tarnish), was just way too much elbow grease for me. I actually had to perch myself above the teapot and use pretty strong movements to mould the cloth around the curves of the pot. I think the principle of a cloth cleaner is a lot simpler than liquid polish, but this cloth was just unmalleable for cleaning silver jewelery and needed too much stregth to clean the teapot. Perhaps the cloths were faulty. I have seen a friend who is a jeweler use a smaller cloth. I will have to investigate about other brand options. After the rave reviews, I was truly disappointed with this product.
",2
32221,"When I received the earrings, I loved them. Wore them once and kept falling off. Wrote to customer service about the problem - that one earring would not shut properly and never received a reply. I would not order from this company again due to their customer service.
",2
32237,"These earrings are beautiful in the box. But on the ears, they are uncomfortable to wear and are very pokey. The gold is also rather thin so sometimes the cross would bend and be even more uncomfortable to wear. I do not recommend this design unless you would like to be poked.
",2
32248,"This necklace is not what you may expect, after going to some Swarovski stores you can tell it has ""other"" quality, maybe crystals come from Swarovski but the necklace is not similar to original ones, maybe it is a good gift for the price, but be sure what you want before order it.
",2
32250,"there were some complaints. first, it took some time for it to be shipped out (4 days). i had it shipped expedited 2-3days and it took 6 days to get to my house. second, its cheaper on the website (10% off). third, three of the diamonds were really dull and under size compared to the other ones. the necklace wasn't as sparkling as the photo showed.
",2
32277,"This locket, although beautiful is for a child. It is very small and dainty. You can't see it in the picture, but there is a cross from top to bottom and side to side. It is a shame that you can't see it and get a real idea of what you are buying. As I do not give religious gifts to anybody, and certainly would not wear one myself, I had to return the locket. If you know a child that you would like to give a gift for maybe a confirmation, or even a birthday, this is a beautiful locket.

32322,"My father bought this for my daughter for a Yule gift. It was lovely, and she couldn't wait to wear it. Unfortunately, when she tried to open it the four leaf clover part popped off. The part went missing, and now we have a blank locket with a glue spot.If it had stayed together I would have given it a four to 5 star rating. It is a very cute piece that is perfect for a young lady.

32638,"Slightly disappointed in jewely box, I know I didn't pay alot for it, but I did read reviews before I purchased and they were pretty good, so I went ahead and purchased it. On receiving it, I feel it is not a good as I thought it would be, it is basically cardboard covered in pink foil with ballerinas on it,the ballerina inside is so-so, her face is a little askew, the music quality is good. I would recommend a different one.
",2
32644,"First, my daughter loved this item, but the build quality left much to be desired. If it weren't for the fact that she pleaded with me not to replace it, I would have sent this back to get a new one. Quality control is lacking - there was a defect in the finish (small piece of applique stuck to the front that I can't pull off/remove) and the top clasp came off (pressed into the lid with 'teeth') after a few days.
",2
32696,"I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas. It looked so pretty. The first one arrived and the lid was broken in half, so I sent it back. Unfortunately I didn't unpack and really look at the first one (I would not have reordered). the second one was unbroken. The paint job on these is marginal at best. The drawers all were very rough to pull out. Grandpa spent several hours sanding and applying plastic runners on drawers so they pulled smoothly. I do not feel it is of very good quality. My granddaughter is only ten and it will be OK for her &#34;little girl&#34; jewelry , but I am very disappointed. Do not expect much!
",2
32723,"I purchased the pendant to replace one that I lost a few weeks ago, but was very disappointed after receiving it and finding out that it was only about one-half inch in size. The pendant that I sought to replace was at least one inch and fit perfectly on my gold chain. Aside from the size, it is a very nice piece of jewelry.
",2
32855,"I was really excited when I got the item but it was shorter than the listed length. After three days of wearing it a got a bumb on the bottom. I believe it was because the jewelry was cheap.

32923,"I loved the color and design of this belly ring. However, I found that the actual ring looked REALLY large in my piercing. My navel piercing isn't very deep, but it also isn't too thin. I believe I wasted my money on something I'll never use.

32997,"I received this ring, along with two others, from Gem Avenue today. I had ordered from Gem Avenue previously and was very happy with the quality of that ring for the price I paid. Unfortunately, the quality of this one didn't match up.The aquamarine stone had no sparkle or shine to it. Even though it was an inexpensive ring, I expected more from Gem Avenue and in fact, I paid less for one of the other rings in today's shipment and it's much nicer.This one went back.

33000,"I bought this ring in the citrine, for my daughter's birthstone, and in the aquamarine, for my son's birthstone.While the Citrine version was absolutely beautiful and sparkly and beyond my expectations, this aquamarine one was a total disappointment. It looks like blue topaz, a stone I do not like very much. Aquamarine is a lighter, more airy color of blue with bits of green. The stone had absolutely no sparkle at all, very very dull. The same holds true for the matching square stud earrings I ordered. Very dull and not the right color. I will be sending both the ring and the earrings back.

33056,"Turquoise Blue Pointy Beaded Tribal Collar NecklaceIt ships in a small plastic square all bunched up. When I opened it, I immediately noticed the beads were cheap AND the necklace was whacked out. The inner thread was distorted and wouldn't lie flat on my body like a necklace, but stuck up and curled inward.I'm flattening it with a book now, and hopefully that'll help. Would NOT buy again, it's not really what I expected...even for five dollars.

I emailed them about it and they have not gotten back to me. I will not order from them again. Prices are great but quality is not.

I was taking it off and it snapped in the middle. Once you could see the insides, it was obviously not pure Sterling Silver as the ""materials"" portion indicates. I will be returning this item for a new one (already gave my girl a matching one) and may not even wear it at all...*very disappointing*

",2
33537,"Well, it arrived two and a half weeks after it was supposed to. There is no way you can wear both rings at the same time without them looking ridiculously huge and awkward!! You can tell they are not real, also after paying shipping and handling online, I had to pay another $15 for shipping when the rings arrived. I recommend looking around a little more, perhaps with a different dealer.
",2
33541,"The earrings are very attractive but there are a few gray areas regarding what the earrings are composed of.The editorial review states that they are made of 14k and are lightweight. For the size of the earrings, if they were solid gold, they would be heavier so they must be plated, and this is never mentioned. What is the base metal? Also the product spec's state that they are made of 18k gold.So which is it, 18k of 14k, are they solid or plated? $95.00 isn't expensive or cheap but I guess I expected a little more than I should have, I suppose.
",2
33556,"I was a little disappointed because this pendant looks stunning. When I got it in between the wire wrapping there was all this crusty white looking stuff. Not actually sure what it was, but its still on the pendant now, because of its position it would be impossible to get out. Other than that I really liked it.
",2
33567,"I got this as a gift but returned it when I saw it. The diamond had a very flat top and was sunk so far down that it was barely visible. The gold seemed good but the diamond ruined the ring.
",2
33582,"Smaller than I expected it to be, and very dull for silver. I put it in jewelry cleaner and polished it out to a better shine. Other than that, the metal stamp was without complaint, as you can clearly see the front and the Navy logo on the back.

33613,"The concept to the necklace was really nice. The poem in it is cute. But the necklace looks cheap. I could have gotten that same necklace from a street vendor for half the price. The cord is way too short and it's way overpriced. I was disappointed totally!
",2
33618,"I ended up returning this necklace. The pearl wasn't that pretty. It didn't match the earrings I had gotten to go with this necklace (they're from the same company). It was a weird shape, neither oval or round. The chain was really cheesy looking. The only reason I gave this necklace any stars was for the bow. Other than that, I didn't like anything else about this necklace.

33708,"I recently purchased three Sajen pieces, two of them were beautiful, and then there was this one. The silverwork and the garnet were both really nice. It was the Cinnabar Heart that ruined the piece for me. I was picturing a carved stone with at least a slight bit of visual texture. Cinnabar (the mineral) should be very refractive unless it is purposely dulled. This is very, very dull cinnabar. This looked like a very matte wax, something that would be decorative on a candle. It will be pretty enough as long as no one looks too closely at it, but overall, I'm far from thrilled with this piece.
",2
33727,"I ordered this ring in a small size and discovered upon receiving it that it was very uncomfotable to wear. The over all shape of the ring in the small size was more oval than round, making it strange to feel between my fingers: the hole for the finger was round, the ring itself oval. I sent it back. It also seemed to me that the diamonds were awfully yellow for their stated color grade.
",2
33754,"There was nothing wrong with this item. It was to be a gift, but when I saw the size I realized that it was too big for a petite gal. It arrived promptly and was refunded without a hitch.
",2
33787,"The charm looks nice, but it is hollow and very light weight. The skin is extremely thin silver. I suspect that the flimsy charm will dent easily, making it very unattractive.In general, the item looks and feels cheaply made. Do not expect it to be any more than a novelty piece.
",2
33823,"Even though the stone itself looks really nice, pretty much identical with real diamond, the cheap setting makes the whole ring look cheap.The prongs are obviously asymmetric and disproportional. The band is really thin.I think even putting a real diamond on this ring would look like fake.
",2
33831,"It looks like it came out of a grocery store gumball machine. I know that it was only $16, but I guess I was expecting a bit more. The prongs were off kilter and the band looks really flimsy.
",2
33835,"This ring has a ""diamond"" that is over sized for how light the actual ring is. Snags on things and the prongs are not sturdy at all. I also bought this other ring and it is way better: [...] Round Cut Cubic Zirconia CZ 925 Sterling Silver Solitaire Ring 0.84 Ct - Nickel Free Engagement Wedding Ring

33842,"Not like the pic! Band is very thin. Looks extremely cheap! Don't think of purchasing. Thinking of sending mine back.

33843,"This ring is very fake looking. The Cubic Zirconia is not clear...I returned it. The size was true, the band is nice, but the rock is very fake looking.
",2
33920,"i recieved the ring today just now actually and i noticed it is a for prong ring not six and the stone is loose i hope i can get it fixed i really want to where this ring. the reason the stone is loose is because the prong is bent if i can straighten it out i might be able to where it. dissapointed
",2
33935,"The ring is cute, but clearly not very high quality...also the heart stone is slightly crooked which was just distracting enough to make me not want to wear the ring. If I were able to go back and re-buy this ring, unfortunately I would probably spend my money on something else.

33938,"The item never came but I am happy with the service they refunded me my money. A little disappointed that it did not come because I was looking forward to wearing it so much.
",2
33944,"so it shines a little but so many imperfections the metal band is cheap disformed and tarnished within an hour of wearing it, i think simply cuz its cheap metal and got wet. the heart doesnt look allot like a heart untill you get close up. cute if its gunna be a play ring or for a yooung teen. as far as wearing this thing im ashamed :(

33992,"I loved this belly jewelry. However, I wore it for a matter of a week and it fell apart. I guess you really do get what you pay for, and that isn't much.

34000,"While the silver casings were very nice, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the scarabs in these earrings. The scarabs were poor quality, and one scarab was smaller than the other. More glue than scarab showed in the setting. Silver Speck refunded my money with no problem, however, retaining my future business.
",2
34001,"The mounting style is what caught my eye. It has nice elevation above the finger. The stone has nice sparkle. The silver prongs add to the brightness of the stone. However the color of the gold is too much in the yellow/orange range to look 'real.' I know it's not real, but aren't we going for a good ""look a-like?"" Overall it is a decent cocktail ring.
",2
34002,"Overall, a very nice ring except for the broken piece of gold underneath the diamonds. Hard to explain but there are little bars that run underneath the diamonds and one was broken. Funny thing was there was a pen or ink mark on each side of the defect, as if somebody had seen it before. Very disappointed that amazon would send something like this out. Obviously we returned it.

34012,"This product was delivered with a ""broken"" fastener for one of the earrings.

34025,"Very attractive but perhaps too fragile for my use. My first toe ring lasted for YEARS and I've had problems replacing it. I did like this one but perhaps as I initially put it on I stretched it out and weakened it. At any rate it lasted about a month then broke.Its replacement, from another source, looks a little thicker and plainer but has lasted longer. (My husband put it on without unbending it at all and that may be the answer.)
",2
34037,"I loved these earrings when I saw them. They were exactly what I was looking for, and didn't disappoint in person. Then, the second time I wore them, the black fell out. BIG let-down.
",2
34160,"This claw ring is smaller than i imagined. Its fairly sharp and looks fantastic, but its much too small to fit any of my fingers except my pinky. (although, it DOSE have bendable band-like things on the bottom that you can bend to your finger, but it will barely hold it.)
",2
34176,"These are very pretty earrings, but the box chain is so thin and smooth that the earrings won't stay in place. They were literally sliding back out of my ear lobes the moment I put them in. I bought these to wear at my wedding and they'd be perfect except for this major flaw. I'm going to buy some of those little rubber earring stoppers and give them a trial run that way, but sadly, I wouldn't recommend them based on this design flaw. The manufacturer must be aware that their design doesn't work. Why they wouldn't add a length of chain in the center that would hold well or at least ship these with rubber earring stoppers is beyond me.
",2
34179,"I bought these awhile ago and finally went to wear them the other day and discovered that although they look great, the chain/string is some weird link that doesn't hang nicely in your ear. Box chain would have worked much better. Pity because they would have been great otherwise.
",2
34244,"The product was very inexpensive, but I expected the ring to be a little more like the picture made it out to look like. When we first received it, I could immediately tell it looked really fake. The only reason I rated it a two, and not a one, is because of the price.
",2
34283,"Surprised after all of the great reviews that this ring wasn't as realistic as I thought it would be. It is too bright and clear and next to my real diamond just looks so different. The size is big for a seven - I can wear this on my middle finger instead of my ring finger which is normally a seven. It is not a ring that I would recommend.
",2
34284,"It looks really cheap in real. Just Like a plastic ring. The picture is a total deceit. Wasted my money.
",2
34287,"I ordered this ring as an impulse and am really disappointed. You get what you pay for. The stoes are beautiful and bright with fantastic sparkle. The band and settings are thin and make the ring appear fake and cheap. I returned it. Also, the sizing runs big. I ordered a 6 and it spun completely around.
",2
34291,"I ordered this ring as a present for myself, but I returned it because it looked really fake--it looks like it came out a dime store the stones are too big, the silver band is too thin, and it was sized too large. Then I had to wait ages for Amazon to reimburse me (which they finally did, thank you!).
",2
34302,"I am not forsure this ring is an actual size 9 because i am a size 9 ring size and this ring is a tight fit!
",2
34315,"Band is really skinny, box that ring was shipped in had a small bag that ring was tucked into liner almost didn't relize something was in pouch. Stones are to large for band they sit on
",2
34316,"I stones were not as big as I thought there were going to be or the look of the stones
",2
34328,"its nice at first glance, once you look at it for a bit you can notice the sliver isn't too smooth and not completely shiny around around the ring.. the CZ stones look amazing! its good for a play ring or a travel ring... but not a great gift!! On someones hand it would look nice to 95% of people around her. spend about $30-50 for a nice CZ,silver ring.. thats what i ended up doing .
",2
34329,"It's an OK ring if you just want big accessories.However, the stones are too big and look very fake (of course), and it makes me feel shallow...Besides, the size is a bit bigger than normal ring size. So order 1 size down if you do want to keep it (I didn't).
",2
34356,"There is no mistaking that this ring is made from cubic zirconia, and there is no chance that a person who knows, even a little, about gemstones would mistake it for diamonds. When the stones are viewed in the center (from above), there is no depth to them. They are highly faceted, so they artificially pick up every color of the rainbow. The CG image shown by Amazon.com is better looking than the actual ring. Two stars for correct fit and nice setting, but this ring is being returned.
",2
34365,"I think this is a really beautiful ring and the CZs are bright and sparkly, but I won't wear it anywhere because the size of the stones make it look like it isn't real to me. I have a smaller CZ ring in sterling silver and I wear it all the time. I was hoping this would be about a 1 carat center stone with 1/2 carat size on the sides. I think that size would look more like real diamonds.
",2
34405,"This might be ok on a larger woman... My fingers are long and slender (size 4.5). I am not a tiny woman but average size. A real ring this size would exceed the value of most newer cars, and it just isn't very real looking. Going to return it
",2
34422,"this ring was very cheap and looked it. Yes i only paid 8 bucks for it but i paid the same amount at another place for a set that people really could not tell wasn't real. This ring immediately became a play ring for my granddaughter.
",2
34424,"I probably should have taken it off when I washed my hands. The silver or whatever started rubbing off and it looked not so good. I had lost my real diamond and was using this as a replacement. For the money, I was hoping it would last longer. But, to my surprise my husband bought me a new diamond for Christmas! This looked really nice at first, but I would definitely take it off before putting your hands in water for any reason or doing any kind of work. Just wear it when you need to and store it when not in use. I probably could have gotten more use out of it.
",2
34437,"First thing I have ordered that I wanted to return to Amazon. It was too fake and cheap looking in my opinion.
",2
34457,"I've always read that Cubic Zirconia is so close to diamonds in its attributes - almost everything excluding strenght, origin and price of course- and I have actually several good pieces of jewelry with Cubic Zirconia and with diamonds and they look very similar to naked eye.I've got this ring and it is actually a nice one, however it is not even close to real diamond's luminosity, sparkle and shade. It just look like a well polished clear glass or crystal.Picture it's just too sharp and the real one is just ""too fake"" to be a diamond one and at the same time with too big pretentions to be a simple silver ring to wear with casual-sport apparel. I would feel pretty uncomfortable wearing it. I was a bit dissapointed when finally got this ring.
",2
34460,"SO i purchased this ring a few months ago just to wear as a ploy to keep men from bothering me..its dont the trick until recently. The ""diamonds"" are very foggy looking no matter how i clea them and it is changing colors and the stones are very loose. I would say great ring if you are only planning to wear it for the short term but not a longterm every day wear.
",2
34501,"The CZ's are shiny and the ring is pretty overall and probably worth the price to most people. Size 5 was perfect!
",2
34535,"I did not like the ring and it looks extremely fake and it shines too much! Not a worth to buy
",2
34548,"it doesn't look anything like the picture. it looks cheap! but then again you get what you pay for right? what was i thinking?
",2
34554,"I don't like it all, I'm going to return it. Even for the price I paid, it's not worth it!
",2
34572,"I couldn't tell by the way the this ring was portrayed from Amazon that the stones were so small !! I love wearing cubics but I like them big. If you are going with fake, might as well get BIG ones. I will probably give this one away
",2
34658,"I was not satisfied with this product at all.I used a product before that only required putting the jewelry in the solution for 15-30 minutes and it came out radiant. With this product, I left my ring in overnight, had to scrub it with a toothbrush, and there were still traces of ""build up"" in some of the crevices of my ring.It was way too expensive for the less than satisfactory results I received. I also emailed the company to let them know I was dissatisfied and asked for a refund (since they say they have a money back guarantee) but never received a reply.I was also annoyed it was around $5.00 for shipping but all I got was an empty plastic container, a ""refill"" packet, and directions on how to make the cleaning solution.If you want this product, just get the refill packet instead of the whole thing.
",2
34688,"The Topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth $45, but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page. The shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5/16"" long; the larger stone is about 3/16"" wide and 1/4"" high; the small stone is about 3/32"" wide. Essentially, you get what you pay for.
",2
34698,"not good - cheap and nasty, bought as a present, but will not give them because they are cheap looking
",2
34706,"The picture is very misleading. The items are much smaller that the picture leads you to believe. I do like the earrings but I believe the price is too high for the quality of the item.
",2
34707,"I guess it was my fault for not comparing measurments. There are verny beutiful ,but really really small and fragile.
",2
34730,"Gave these as a gift and the recipient was surprised at how ""dainty"" they were. More importantly, they arrived broken, so she returned them and received credit because they were no longer in stock. I see that they are now available, but would not order them again because of the description I received from the recipient. She did love my 5x7mm swiss blue topaz earrings in white gold so I thought these would be an even more beautiful and elegant gift. I was wrong and wish I'd sent her the same as mine.
",2
34746,"Pros: The metal seems to be be true as described as ""14K Yellow gold."" The pouch that it came with was cute and appropriate for the product. The product was delivered on time as it was promised.Cons: The gemstone (garnet), though small, lacks the luster as other garnet gemstone would look like.It is also smaller than I expected for the the price it was listed (please see picture with a pen cap adjacent to it). The box that it came with was crushed. So disappointed with the packaging.
",2
34748,"I had read reviews discussing how tiny these earrings are, but was still surprised when I opened them. I would almost say the size is more appropriate for a child, but the design would not be appropriate for a child. They are made well, pretty, but know that these are really tiny earrings.
",2
34749,"These earrings are much smaller than the picture indicates. They are cute but the price is too high for the quality you receive.
",2
34750,"I was surprised to see these when they arrived. The picture is misleading - it would be helpful to put something else in the picture to give the buyers a better idea of just how small this item truly is.
",2
34768,"These photograph well but are rather cheap-looking up close. For what I paid I expected better craftsmanship.
",2
34775,"The earrings look nice in the pictures. But the ones i got did not look as nice. you can see the where they put them together and the color is dull on those spots. and I don't think mine are that shiny when I got them
",2
34793,"These earings are very pretty. I actually bought them to wear for my wedding. When I first got them and tried them on, the metal making up the earring was so soft, the hook to go in the ear bent. It was really dissapointing. I guess I'll only be able to wear them that one day.
",2
34800,"The pearls were not well strung and looked like something that could be picked up in a dimestore (if they existed anymore). I returned them. The only good thing is Amazon's excellent return policy -- easy and quick and courteous.
",2
34864,"This necklace is darling but the chain is extremely short. I placed it on my 6 year old's neck to get an exact idea about the length because it was choking me. It looked like it was made for a child lengthwise after seeing it on my own child. I had to take the necklace apart and add another extender to the other side of it so I could wear it comfortably.
",2
34880,"Although this ring is gorgeous, and very ornate (for such a small ring). There was one drawback. It turned my finger green. I only wear sterling silver or white gold jewelry, and I have many sterling silver rings, none of those rings have turned my finger green. This lead me to believe that the ring was not sterling silver as it states on the website. I would not recommend buying this ring, or any jewelry from the silver insanity company.
",2
34917,"I purchased this not really for it's intended purpose of cleaning jewelry, but because I remembered a childhood friend using one to clean off carbon deposits on spark plugs. I figured that cleaning hearing-aid tubes would be a cinch.Well, it seemed to have no effect on hearing aid tubes. So I tried a few more things and the results were not remarkable. It may be great for jewelry, but I just don't know.
",2
34931,"Not sure what I was expecting quality-wise for a sterling silver ring, but this felt cheap and plasticky in my hands, like something I could have purchased at the dollar store. That said, I couldn't believe I paid over $20 for it. Definitely returned it and am waiting for it to arrive back in LA so I can get my refund. Head to Etsy for better quality, real Irish rings.

34947,"This is an all-right item. The color is not as vivid as the picture shown, and the workmanship is poor. I'd only recommend it to someone who is less than 20-year-old.
",2
34954,"Although the ring is very nice looking it bent easily. Maybe I don't know enough about metals or silver in particular to know what kind of durability to expect, but this ring was really soft, almost like pewter. It just didn't have the quality I was expecting.
",2
35005,"It is just too thin. U do not realize that - until u get it. If u want something small , this is good.
",2
35071,"The peridot bracelet I ordered came and I was very disappointed to find the stones were not at all like the photo. They are very pale and watery looking, hard to see that they were green. The design is wonderful, quality is good and it came promptly, but I am going to return it because I will never be happy with the nearly colorless stones. It came from Peora, SKU sb2864.Flo Philips
",2
35155,"So the earring is nice and all, but DEFINITELY NOT 4 inches. Mine is 2.5"" long, which is MUCH smaller than I expected and what I needed. Is it pretty? Sure. Will I wear it? Probably not as it's not as dramatic as I expected. That 1.5"" that's missing makes a HUGE difference on the look you're going for. Quality is good, but really disappointed as I was going after a long earring, not your regular, you can buy anywhere length. Check back, as I'm posting a picture of it on top of a ruler.
",2
35180,"These were cheaply priced and cheaply made. One of the coconut moons fell off the earring hook as I removed it from the shipping container. I've tried to put it back together for wearing, but the one time I did wear it, the moon fell off again within an hour of putting them on. They are pretty, but probably not worth the price.
",2
35203,"I know it is a cheap ring but advertisement makes product seem better then it is..I would not buy this product again
",2
35252,"The chain is really pretty, but it is way tooo skinny... the picture makes it look like a thick chain but it is really thin
",2
35265,"While the style of the necklace was nice the quality of the silver is poor, very poor and not marked as being silver either which makes me wonder if its silver at all
",2
35269,"A rosary and a necklace are NOT the same thing. It is disrespectful to wear a rosary as a necklace. Rosaries should only be worn on the belt or around the wrist to keep it close for praying, NOT as an ornament. If you are Catholic and you wear it, you should know better and if you are not and you wear it, you should know it sends the wrong message and is offensive. Crosses or crucifixes may be worn around the neck, however, so if you're looking for something to wear it's not this product.
",2
35274,"Ordered these as a perfect match to a necklace my husband bought me but when i opened the pkg. I absolutely could not believe how small these are !! I have medium length hair but if I dont pull it up you would never see these teenie tiny earrings hanging from the ear.. very dissapointed !!
",2
35296,"Design is lovely. Bold with lots of sparkle. The down side is, it's starting to lose it's finish. I've tried cleaning it to no avail. If it gets much worse, it will be time for the garbage can.
",2
35305,"I waited a long time to order this pendant and was disappointed. The gold latch is a little too large and the stone is a very poor piece. It has several different colors and grains going in different directions with different kinds of shines to it. It is not a smooth white piece like the picture.
",2
35314,"I like the look of this pendant and the carving is very nice and it's not to big or small, but the hole that the chain or cord has to go through is very tiny. I could not even fit a small size chain throught it, I had to buy a special bail and clip it on and then thread a chain through the bail. Just a little too much trouble for my taste.
",2
35320,"These earrings have a pretty design, but the stones were reddish brown, not the deep red that I prefer. I returned them.
",2
35351,"These are great for making necklaces longer but they are thick and really doesn't look right with finer chains that I have.
",2
35379,"Was looking for a chain extender for my chain necklace. These were to flimsy and they weren't a close enough match.
",2
35431,"I purchased this item as a gift for my wife, and was quite disappointed.Despite the item's description, the pearls were all irregular and not well matched. They were also dull in appearance and had very visible flaws.Admittedly, at this price point, you're not going to have a perfect strand of pearls. However, a side-by-side comparison with the14k Yellow Gold Akoya Cultured Pearl 6.5-7mm Necklace and Stud Earring Setshowed that the Akoya set had pearls that were all round or near-round, very well matched, and were not noticeably smaller than this necklace. Not to mention the price was about the same, and you get matching earrings.
",2
35449,"These earrings are gorgeous. But I only go to wear them for a day because they fell out somewhere along the way.
",2
35589,"I bought this bracelet for my over 50 sister, who loves a little bling, and Swarovski crystals are sparkly and beautiful. I was so disappointed to open the box and find a bracelet full of plastic beads! Very fashionable for a teen or young adult, but not at all what I'd expect for an older, more mature, adult.
",2
35603,"Earrings pretty to look at but very light. A good price didn't matter since I lost one the first time I wore them. Earrings this light should have backs to keep secure. I complained to vendor and got no reply, not even an an acknowledgement or apology.
",2
35616,"I love the earrings but one of my stones is noticeably smaller than the other. I don't wear them much because of it. Wish I could buy one earring in hopes of matching a pair.
",2
35643,"These earrings look great in the picture but, when I got them they where very cheap looking. Lucky they where a gift and the person did not mind but, BEWARE these earrings are cheap looking.
",2
35659,"Looked like a very nice pair of earrings online, but seemed plastic-like in nature once received. I was embarrassed to give them as a gift but it was too late to replace them.
",2
35702,"i liked them but they were not what i thought i was going to get. very cheap looking
",2
35718,"i thought i was getting the sat of 36 studs you offer... bummer. its not worth returning at 498 on a 6.99 dollar item...
",2
35753,"O.K. this is my second try doing the review for this item. When I bought this item in November the cost was only $9.99. It says Sterling Silver (I wear sterling silver jewelry all the time so I thought nothing of it) and began to wear it the day I got the ring in it's little white box. I took it off when I got home-before washing dishes, sleeping, showering etc. then wore it the following day to work. It turned my finger green after wearing it for only 4 hours. Someone told me to put clear nailpolish on it but why should I have to do that if it's genuine sterling silver like all my other rings that don't turn my finger green? It's pretty, thats for sure but I can't wear it too long due to the green factor. I wouldn't pay more than the $15 bucks (shipping and handling along with the price tag) I ended up paying for it.
",2
35762,"The picture looks better than the product. There are only 5 sides. The sides are not even square, being about 4mm x 5mm. On regulation dice, the sum of opposite sides is supposed to be ""7"", but the 5 is opposite the 3 and the 4 is opposite the 2. The 6 is opposite nothing, as the ""1"" side is open. The presentation was very nice, a velvet drawstring bag within a gift box. With the cost of gold being what it is, this probably the best they can do for the price. Maybe you should buy a magnifier to go with it.
",2
35778,"This charm is small and beautiful ... the hook on the charm broke after 1 week ... considering the price I was shocked at the small size and the fact that it broke so quickly ... BUT I will not return this product because I do love it despite the downfalls
",2
35800,"The color of these earrings is very light gray not as dark as picture. Very disappointed.
",2
35803,"they are good but the real color looks nothing like the picture its a clear gray so if you want them because they are dark dont buy them
",2
35832,"Okay, I may be picky, but these earrings are just too thin! I get the idea of delicate, sparkly things, but these don't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial. They are pretty and sparkly, but the crystal looks like all I could afford was a thin slice. The picture also makes the crystals appear blue-ish, but mine are more of a yellow-ish tint. Not what I expected.
",2
35840,"Light weight, very cheap. I was underwhelmed. They are NOT sterling silver, only plated. Have already started to bother my ears. Never buying earrings from Amazon again.
",2
35844,"I have some genuine Swarovski earrings that a friend who is a jewelry maker gave to me. These look like glass in comparison. They do not pick up or reflect any colors whatsoever. The facets all line up, but they are definitely NOT the real thing.
",2
35847,"It is little Less than OK. Rating 2 is most appropriate for this kind of product.
",2
35856,"I was mislead by the Swarovski name these are not Swarovski standard. I also planned on giving them as a gift but have decided I would be embarrassed to do so.The earring actually fell apart when I removed it from the bag.
",2
35889,"They lost their luster soon after purchasing them and the size is a little too big. I never wear them anymore.
",2
35909,"I bought these earrings along with the pair for my daughter (SCER168 Butterfly Lavender Swarovski Crystal Sterling Silver 1"" Long Post Drop Earrings) because it says they are Swarovski. But when I received them, they look cheap and I really doubt that they are authentic Swarovski. Kind of felt being cheated. If the seller can approve they are authentic, I am willing to take back this review.
",2
35939,"THE EARRINGS ARE VERY PRETTY AND I LOVED THE SIZE. HOWEVER, I WAS TRYING TO MATCH THEM TO A NECKLACE. THESE HAD A ORANGY TONE TO THEM AND WOULD NOT MATCH. HAD TO SEND THEM BACK.
",2
35944,"It had a yellow tint to it that I wasn't expecting. Also looks a little cheap. Probably won't wear it much.
",2
35968,"The picture shown does not come close to what arrived in the mail today. I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much when I ordered these earrings for my wife, based on the price. But I wouldn't have paid more than $5 for the earrings that came in the mail if I saw them at a store. The first thing I noticed was how the Opal lacked the iridescent play of color they are known for. The second thing I noticed was the color of the silver; slightly brown. It does not look like sterling silver; it resembles silver I've seen from mines in Mexico that cause discoloration on the skin. I'll have to check the silver, and I'll be taking a closer look at the 'opal' to see if it isn't really Slocum Stone. The only reason I gave it a 2 is the price and somewhat quick delivery.
",2
36030,"I bought this for Mother's day, I think. My mom had to stop wearing it after a while because the clasp kept snagging on to the bed sheets or blanket and started getting loose. She changed the clasp and it worked better. My mom liked it and that's all that matters but she hasn't worn in a while. So maybe not as good as advertised.
",2
36042,"Looked like something you would buy at the dollar store. Boxing was extremely cheap looking and the clasp was not as shown in pic of product. Would not recommend this purchase.
",2
36059,"When i bought this i thought it would have been much bigger, but to be honest my girl really like it so i guess thats all that matters
",2
36065,"I bought this necklace because my girlfriend likes smaller, not-guaudy jewelery. I thought that this may fit the bill. In the photos, it shines, and the scale is slightly ambiguous.When it arrived, it was dingy and smaller than I expected. On top of that, the diamonds are low quality (I knew that they would not be great with an I color rating and I2 clarity, but COME-ON MAN!).I am going to try to shine this up with some kind of cleaner, and hope it shines up a bit.
",2
36140,"its a nice ring, but the pearl keeps popping off, i had it glued back on but it doesn't stay and i've only had this ring for about 5 months, very disappointing
",2
36180,"I review this item, i check out the pro's and the con's. I should of listening to the con's more. I'm very dissatisfied with this ring. The only reason I'm keeping it because I hate to order items and return them. The ring is very small. I order two heart shaped rings, and I love the cheaper one better than i liked the 14K two-tone diamond heart ring. I hope no one else order this ring looking for a good deal, because it's not. I gave it a two-star because for the money I paid for the ring, and it fits perfect, I will keep it. For two hundred bucks I was expecting a little more. Sorry about the bad review, but I tell it like it is.
",2
36204,"Despite the fact that the jet faceted beads are nice and the bracelet is well made, the silver tone beads are antiqued and not as bright as I would have liked. If you like that antique look you will like this bracelet.
",2
36233,"I've had this product for less than a year, it is not the best quality and has tarnished. The chain is microscopic and not worth $35. I would not recommend it.
",2
36265,"This chain is much smaller than I thought it would be. It was too small and feminine for a man. Also, the clasp is very hard to open. I was dissappointed in this chain.
",2
36266,"good service, but disappointed in size of product. smaller than what I thought chain would be from measurement and picture.
",2
36278,"This chain is pretty, but the clasp makes it not worth the money or effort. My fingers do not have the nimbleness needed to use this rather tiny clasp. Forget about purchasing the product, it's not worth the problems associated with the clasp.
",2
36300,"i just got mine and i m gonna reture it, it's sooooo big(larger than 1 dollar coin) and the silver chain is about 20 inch long. i will share pics later.
",2
36321,"The ring was pretty good at first, but then it got all these scratches. The shininess went away easily.
",2
36333,"I found the cut of this bracelet to make it look cheap/tacky.
",2
36362,"I think it was a little to small and dark. Pick on that is a littlemore happy and chain isn't good. I gave it to my sister.
",2
36378,"i find the engraved text too small, smaller than visualized in the image showncuff is also not so good since it is not adjustable to wrist size. perhaps a bracelet type would be better...
",2
36420,"I paid $4.50 for the earrings and that is exactly what they are worth. I was looking for anything ruby shaped like a heart and I did not have much to choose from. I was hoping even though these were priced very low that they would be a little bit better quality but like I said, I got what I paid for so I guess it is okay.
",2
36430,"This necklace actually uses a lot of materials, but it is way too much for someone as petite as I am. It occupied too much area and it looked cheap.
",2
36433,"the ring its self is nice.but the thing that confuses is me is why these rings are sized 10 or 9 or lower. i got the biggest size to be safe (9 i think), and the stupid ring looked like it could barley fit a 5 year old. its as if they expect you to have skeleton sized fingers.theres no way the ring was a size nine if so then a size fize according to this ring is the radius of a pencil
",2
36451,"The string to the eye patch broke by the end of the night and the earring kept falling off. It looked cheap too.
",2
36499,"These were too small and quickly lost their luster. The detailing was pretty but they were absolutely too small. Maybe they'd work for children but I believe not for adults. Also, the post broke on one of them and the only way to repair was to take to jeweler. Not worth the expense!
",2
36502,"These are super cute, but when my daughter wore them the back fell off and she lost one earing. She is really disappointed.
",2
36539,"I ordered this for my daughters 16th birthday. It is described as 1 inch which would have been the perfect size. However, it is not 1 inch but almost 3/4 of an inch. It is less than 1/2 inch wide even though it is described as 1 inch wide. It looks like something for a small child. I have learned my lesson and will never order from this company again. My daughter has a lot of health concerns and this was supposed to be a special gift for her. This is my most disappointing order of this holiday season. Glad I did not order the chain from this company!!!
",2
36544,"I still think it is adorable and that is why I bought it, but I put it in and it was extremely sharp on the rose petals. By the next day, It had cut into my skin and every time that I sat down it caused great pain. By the time I went to take it out two days later the red on the rose had begun to fade and was staining my skin. Overall, not a good experience.
",2
36553,"The fresh water pearl bracelet was a great deal but is very thin in person. I would recommend buying it as a first bracelet for a lil girl.
",2
36558,"I saw the beautiful earrings on the net and decided to buy them, along with some other stuff. When my package came home they were nothing like the picture, I don`t know what happened but a pair of plain hoops was what I recieved...
",2
36602,"The beads on this necklace are very small and lightweight; they feel like plastic beads rather than stones. The necklace is also very short, so in general it reminds me of a little girl's play jewelry. However, with the right look it is still cute - just don't expect high quality. I do like the color. Also an important note: I almost returned this because I thought it had no clasp and it wouldn't fit over any adult's head. When I looked more closely, I noticed that two of the beads screw together and this is how it opens. That works to my advantage because I have an allergy to a lot of metal clasps, so for me the feature is a plus. If you have metal allergies, this necklace will work for you.
",2
36613,"was prettier on the site. It looks a little cheap and I got the matching bracelet and earrings. The earrings fell apart several times and i do not wear the set anymore
",2
36634,"Silver part is obviously painted. This bracelet is not bad, but it really does not look as good as the picture makes it out to be. I am not even sure if the jade is real. If it is real then the cheap setting is at least making it look fake.
",2
36635,"The jade used is very pretty. But the clasp won't close properly and it falls off all the time. I wouldn't buy it again.
",2
36646,"I give two stars out of kindness. The cleaner does clean well, however, minutes after opening it and taking it out of the box, the plastic on the lid cracked. I've used it possibly 10 times now and every time the crack on the lid webbed out more and more. Today, on the 11th use, the lid broke off completely. Now, before accuse me of manhandling the machine in order to break it, you should know that I store it under the sink and gently lift it out from under the sink with each use (realizing how fragile it was with the first use). So now it's completely unusable.
",2
36662,"the jewelery is very nice but to small for my nipple..so far I can only where bars with decoration haning frm it
",2
36681,"I bought this for my girl back home.she was very happy to recieve it,called it pretyy and said that she simply loved it.she wore it one day and the chain broke.I am very upset.I hate having to buy extra things just to fix the item I originally bought to try to make it better.I should come brand new and well made.lets face it who like to buy faulty items.On the upside the rose was very beautiful she said.so unless you wanna buy an extra more expensive chain do not wast your time.
",2
36697,"I thought this would be much bigger and better made. To be honest, it kind of looks like it came out of a gumball machine. I would give this to a little kid, but never an adult. I kept it, but it is expensive for what you get. Looks cheap and not as nice as I had hoped.
",2
36727,"I only had it a week before one of the jewels fell out of the wing. The metal is already tarnishing too. Spend your money on a higher quality item.
",2
36734,"This ring is cool but after wear it a week one of the ball end came off. No problem I thought I can just use one my others. Then a ;littlt while after that the yin yang fell out. Nice so you see I am not wasring it any more...
",2
36742,"This ring is pretty which is why I bought it, but the the band metal is so thin it uncomfortable to wear. It cuts in between my fingers making it painful to wear.
",2
36747,"I was so excited to get these earrings. I ordered them Sunday and they arrived Wednesday, so I was impressed with the speedy delivery. However, when I opened up the package, the back post that goes into the ear was badly bent. I went to fix one of them (not using a lot of pressure or force at all) and the whole inside part of the rose came completely off and would not go back in. Thinking I would try to superglue it back together I turn to the next earring. I pick it up, and the middle pearl falls off!!! I was so disappointed. I tried bending and supergluing last night with not much luck. They are very pretty and I hope I can get them fixed. They look exactly like the picture, just don't breathe on them or they will fall apart!!!
",2
36776,"i expeted this thing to acually work and be some fun for my daughter but it didnt even change colers. Then i found one that acually worked at a fair for $1.89
",2
36872,"I chose 2 stars for my rating because I bought this to give to my sister as a gift and unfortunately it just feels too cheap to give it to her. I put it on myself and it is pretty - would be good for someone who likes bigger proportions/sizes in their jewelry (not particularly delicate). And I would recommend it to you if you think it is pretty, you need a silver every day kind of necklace and you are going to be wearing it yourself. Unfortunately, as a gift, it just comes across as a cheap necklace - when you hold it in your hand the medallion and the chain make a tin-like sound against each other and the under-side of the medallion is hollow and not smooth. Again, it is pretty when it is on and the quality can be kept as your little secret if you don't mind.
",2
36888,"I received this pendant today. The chain is nice and the lustre is decent, but there is one segment of the outer ring that is flat, not curved - so the circle looks like it has a big dent in it. This is so strange looking it is very distracting. Even though it was inexpensive, it looks so bad I think most people would rather receive nothing than this as a gift. I will be returning it.
",2
36904,"Okay, it was cheap, but it looked cheaper than I expected. Luckily, I don't really like the person I bought it for. It might be nice for a child or someone who likes odd butterfly designs a lot. The chain was short, but I'll take responsibility for being too lazy to get my tape measure out.
",2
36931,"This brand is rather cheap, however it isn't expensive so I shouldn't be surprised. The thing is taking the links apart, I dented them just taking them apart, so be careful! The laser engraving looks great, I do have to say.
",2
36940,"It was much smaller that I anticipated. So small can't see guardian angel on pendant. Very disappointed. The pendant had to be magnified to be able to take a picture.
",2
36962,"I should have read all the reviews. The person that said this was perfect for a 6 month old was correct. The cross is EXTREMELY SMALL and the chain is really thin. I purchased this for a 10 year old, so I am returning it.
",2
37003,"The ring arrived in a very nice American Pearl box with polishing cloth, velvet bag, and guarantee policy. Presentation was very good.The good: The setting is well done. The diamonds have good fire and are 'white' enough to compliment the white gold. They are also color-matched well to each other. They are not exactly the same size on close inspection, but are too small to really notice from more than a few inches away.The bad: The pearl is not black at all like most south sea pearls and has no green overtone. It is medium grey and looks nothing like the pearl pictured on Amazon or American Pearl's website. This is also NOT an 18K ring, it is clearly stamped ""14K"" inside the band. If the pearl color was not enough to make you return it, the lesser quantity of gold than advertised should be.Conclusion: Overall it is a very pretty ring even though the pearl doesn't look anything like the pearl you are expecting to receive, nor like 90% of south sea pearls. The setting is really nice. It is not 18 karat gold making this ring about $80-100 less valuable.I contacted American Pearl two weeks ago per the instructions that came in the box, and I have yet to receive a response. To be fair, I will update my review based on their response if one is received.
",2
37017,"These earrings looked beautiful in photo, but when I received them in the mail, the chain was very thick. I expected a more delicate look, but could not return them because I opened the package and it was against the return policy. They are also not the same length. When I put them side by side, I noticed one pearl hangs lower than the other...probably not noticeable when you wear them, but it still bothered me.
",2
37018,"This choker can be slightly bent / adjusted, but it didn't lay right on my neck. I tried adjusting it to different widths, but it didn't curve around my neck no matter what, just kinda dug into the sides of my neck near the back. It also fell off quite often. Maybe b/c my neck is on the larger side, around 15 inches, but I'm not sure. The ends don't really curve around the back of the neck as pictured.
",2
37040,"The locket looks really cheap...almost fake. I did buy it as costume jewelry for my stepdaughter...but I expected something of a higher quality...
",2
37042,"Seller was poor at communicating. Didn't respond to message's both voicemail and email.Product sent was not what was requested or purchased. Actual ring was of lessor quality and value and sapphire was a darker blue than shown.Very dissapointed with purchase and extremely annoyed that I am now out of pocket approximately $400 NZD dollars in tax, duty and freight costs for receiving an incorrect product from one of your merchants.This will affect decisions to purchase through Amazon again.
",2
37049,"It's okay. Not bad enough to return, but not what I was expecting. It's slightly bigger than I wanted. It's very thin. It looks cheap to me.One of the problems of shopping online for this type of item. You need to be able to see in person.The chain broke before it was even unwrapped. I was't planning on using that chain anyway, so no big deal. I would have been upset if I was planning on using - but it probably would have broke on the first wear!This pendant is going to my 10-year old niece. I don't care if she loses it.
",2
37052,"I bought this necklace for myself a while ago....and I don't wear it anymore, because the silver ""chipped off"" and tarnished. It's really disappointing. I think I threw out the charm because it disappointed me so much!Is it worth your money? I don't think so.
",2
37055,"I liked it til it broke like the second week. The links should be a bit stronger...
",2
37065,"The necklace arrived exactly as it was shown and described. Attractive, colorful yet it generated feelings of coldness rather than warmth for me. In fact, my body rejected the energy which the necklace emitted.I contacted the seller, explained the situation, and had absolutely no problem in returning the item. The seller was polite, cooperative and honest.
",2
37081,"I order this ring size 9 the one I received was size 11! I already paid $5 for shipping it to my mailbox in the states then it was shipped to me in the Middle East for $8 so it isn't worth returning it back because ill have to pay for the shipping from the Middle East to the seller.
",2
37101,"Many places especially on the wings and seal, it is alot black and it makes it look very dirty. I did not like this dragon necklace and I think it could be better because it looks like it is made by an amateur. I am not impressed.It did come with a standard chain and a pouch for the necklace though.
",2
37124,"Looks better online than in person.Very disappointed with the lack of sparkle.Stones look really cloudy /fake.Did come in a very nice ring box.Should have spent a little more to get a little more.
",2
37138,"This ring is so pretty, I got so many comments on it. But it's not very sturdy or strongly made. I slipped my hand into a file cabinet and the ring caught on a file folder and snapped right in half! I was so upset because it's so pretty and I loved wearing it. So my advise would be - wear when you're not working!
",2
37139,"I purchased this ring only to return it. It's a beautiful ring, but the quality is not very good. It says it is adjustable, but when I tried to tighten it, it sounded like it was cracking. I thought it would break in half. It felt like a plastic ring, rather than sterling silver.

37158,"My wife and I were both quite surprised when we received this. It is really, really thin. She is afraid that it would be easily broken if one of the grandkids hooked their fingers in it. It is so thin that it is hard to see the detail that makes it a box chain. It is not easy to judge how jewelry will look from the photo on the computer screen, and will probably stop us from ordering any more over the internet.

37238,"The user instructions provided with the Jewel Jet Steamer caution against steam cleaning most gemstones except rubies and diamonds. After some online research I learned that steam cleaning is not recommended for tanzanite, emerald, topaz, etc. You can read more about this at http://www.andrewberry.co.uk/gemstones_care_of.htm. Although the Jewel Jet cleans most diamond and ruby jewelry, you will need use the ""soapy water and soft brush"" method for everything else. If I had known that steam cleaning was so limited, I would not have purchased the unit. That's probably why there is no warning about steam cleaning jewelry in the product write-up. I should have done my research before ordering.

37303,"I bought this with the highest hopes, but was rather disappointed when I opened the package only to find the front scratched and the hoop (that connects to a necklace) bent at about 45 degrees. Luckily (or maybe not so luckily) the metal is VERY pliable, so I was able to bend it to its correct setting. I don't think I'll be wearing it as often as I had hoped.
",2
37318,"Although this necklace is very dainty and pretty, it arrived with one stone loose at the bottom of the nice blue velvet gift bag. Upon inspection I discovered bent prongs, which must have happened before it shipped as there was no damage to the box and it was very securely packaged. This truly is a very delicate and fragile necklace; I would only recommend it for special occasion wear by someone with the most careful and gentle hands. I recommend that it be stored in the small gift bag, away from other jewelry, to prevent any damage to the prongs (which should be inspected upon receipt, and before each wearing to avoid losing stones). Speaking from half a century of experience, you may wish to consider another, more substantial item as a gift, as the fortunate recipient will surely want to wear your gift with pride and pleasure for many years to come. An item of fine jewelry, broken and languishing at the bottom of a jewelry box after perhaps only a few wearings, would not make wonderful memories. I hope this review was helpful to you, and I wish you the best of luck in finding just the right piece for that special person (especially if that special person is yourself!).

The other earring says it made out of some other material. It give off the sound of metal. I did the test numerous times on these earrings as well as check to see if the diamond tester was working... I think its a classic bait and switch. Im going to take it to a diamond expert to double check

Needless to say, they are being returned.

I knew not to expect much, but I've never seen a black diamond before, so I was intrigued.When I got the earrings, they looked ok (I plan to add some diamond jackets in the future), but way smaller than anticipated. I really don't think the ""1 cttw"" is accurate. 1/2 ct stones are larger than these. In any case, you do get what you pay for, and they seem to be a fair value at the price I paid. At full price, these babies would have taken a round trip!

37707,"Was disappointed all around, sorry to say. The bracelet was not formed with the bias of the wrist; The metal was not thick enough or formulated with enough base metal to withstand body heat so it constantly lost shape and loosened - the design could be seen from the underside/inside. But more importantly it quickly cracked and broke from the edge to one of the star's because of the above reasons as well as, apparently, from not having a thick enough border/edge. Also, upon arrival even one of the star's had already lost it's blacking. However, I liked the idea; If manufacturer recalculated the design I'd try to purchase it again....

37752,"I bought 16 of these since I knew they'd be weak and I'd need spare parts.The hinges will break instantly and you'll have to replace them. I suggest labrets or brads with solder. I really do mean instantly. The very first time you bend your finger, the hinges will pop. Be prepared.The tips are too sharp to get into most clubs so you'll need to dremel the tips.Pewter is so weak that a few scritches will bend the finger tip grips out so you'll have to bend them back. Doing this more than a few times will break the tip along the line of the beautiful pattern.For a $4 each costume piece (what I paid), they are fine for a little while. I feel very sorry for anyone who paid $30 for just one of these.I receive lots of complements on their beauty.

I have had several toe rings and I have learned to choose them wide and thick so that I can keep them on all summer. Like the prior reviewer mentioned, when you take them on an off a lot, they wear and eventually break at the bend point. I can not wear thin toe rings because they slide and turn too much and dig into my toe, so a wide ring is best for me. I highly recommend this ring! I have worn it through many showers and it's holding up nicely!Edit - June 29, 2011I wrote too soon! Last Friday, I was walking and this toe ring split in two and fell off. I hadn't been taking it off, so I wasn't causing a bend impression in the ring. At most, I would tighten or loosen a bit, if needed. It lasted me @ two months. ;-(

So I took some tweezers and bent the tops out just a little bit, then I took an emery board and filed the wings down, making them have blunt edges instead of sharp edges.All the alterations did not effect the look or fit of the ring at all, just the comfort level.I would recommend this product, just be aware you might have to do some adjusting yourself.

37987,"Well, it seemed like a good idea and I wanted to love it. . . . I purchased this bracelet for one of my son's friends, who just turned 16 and loves the theater--and I'm decidedly disappointed. The drama masks are so small one can barely see them and the sterling silver feels featherweight. I could see paying $20 or even $25 for this, but, personally, I don't think it's worth $40+. I wish I had time to look for something else. The image shown gave me the impression that, while not of significant size, the masks would at least be identifiable from a short distance. And they're really not. Maybe it's me? Both of the prior reviewers gave it five stars and said they thought it was wonderful. But I have to say, for me. . . not so much.

Once I received these I was even happier as the post slides into the hoop so you don't have to deal with clasps which won't catch or if they do catch, pinch your ear for that split second. Unfortunately, I believe the cheap ones would have been preferable. Note: These are VERY THIN hoops; the posts which slide into the hoop? great concept unfortunately, mine keep sliding back out. So every time I wear these hoops, by mid-day I have to search my office for a silver hoop(s) as the post has become undone on one or both. Not impressed. On the up-side though, it appears to be a very good silver.

The small CZs aren't shiny anymore, you can barley see them.

38043,"I bought this ring for my wife so she could wear something in place of her wedding ring when she didn't want to damage her real one. First of all, the price of the ring is cheap, so I know that I can't complain too much, however, when I got the ring, it was for a Christmas stocking stuffer. The picture showed a nicely wrapped package with a bow. What I got was a tiny package that was wrapped so poorly with a generic computer printed label with no bow. I had to unwrap it to redo the wrapping, which was a good thing anyways because I wanted to check out the ring. The center diamond is very pretty, however, it is set crooked and looks like it is about to fall out. The side bands look much cheaper than the picture. I don't think the small amount of money that I spent on this ring was even worth it. The nice thing is that the center band can be removed and worn as a solitare. Not exactly what I was going for, but oh well. I will probably return this ring.

I'm not too disappointed because they were relatively cheap when I purchased them, but now I can't use them anymore. Perhaps spending a few dollars more for better quality earrings would have been worth it.

It only holds studs and a few of those for pierced ears that are shaped the right way to hang on the rather wide dividers. I suppose some of those old clip-on pairs would work on this too, but I don't use them anymore, so I don't need to display them with the current ones.On the other hand, this item is cheap, cheap, CHEAP! Mine arrived with the inner package slightly dented, and when I pulled the item out of that package, the hinge of one panel was completely disconnected from the next panel's complementary hinge parts. When my husband tried to set the two parts parts back together, the other hinge holding it snapped and broke--cheap plastic!--and the panel completely broke from the other three. Now I have a single panel and a separate three-panel set. Very cheap! On the other hand, even the single panel can stand while I'm working on it, and I can fold it and store it in a drawer with the three-panel set. But this item, in one or two pieces, isn't strong or good-looking enough to be displayed! Still, I can use it till something better comes along! And it would cost me more to return it, so what the heck!

38327,"You pay for what you get... The bracelet is of a dollar store type quality, so if you are purchasing this as a primary gift, I would advise you not too. But as an add on to a better gift, then ok. The quality is very low. I think it would be more for sentiment only and would be ok. I doubt the person I bought it for will wear it, and I won't blame her. Maybe hanging it from her rear view mirror would be nice.I had gotten one of these before and the quality was great. Heavy silver with beautiful beads. So I expected this one to be the same, but it is just light metal (almost plastic-ish, spray painted silver), and the beads are plastic. I was disappointed but considering what I paid, I should have known better.

Not worth the price.Doesn't seem to be real silver either.
",2
38638,"I never bought a puzzle ring before, and I never will again. It was a pain to figure out and the website does NOT have a solution. The ring was already tarnished, especially in the spots where the rings overlap. If you take off the string (which you eventually will), the rings easily come apart when you take it off your finger (or when you need to polish the rings), which is very inconvenient b/c then you have to ""reassemble"" it again.I wasn't expecting this much trouble, and it would've helped if it came with instructions. I plan on returning this ring.

",2
38678,"Watch out with these. I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart. The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off. They are useless now.

38795,"I personally used the tape and the e-water lotion together and the combination effectively subdue my neck-shoulder ache which I have for many years. I applied the lotion daily after bath at night and replace the tape every 2-3 days. I am convinced with the technology that I decided to try their jewellery products since having the tape seen on body is not a pretty sight to public eye. Before I make any haste/impulse purchase, I googled for the product reviews and realised it is a mixed reviews - ~50:50 positive and negative. As I am convinced with what I have experienced with the tape and lotion effect, so I decided to trust my gut feeling to get the bracelet. I take it as the 50% negative reviews could be because the users do not have any pain/aches to begin with so they do not experience any ""miracle"". For example, if you have a flawless skin to begin with, you will not expect any miracle effect even if you apply La-mer/SKII/Lancome/Estee Lauder expensive skincare product daily. That's the logic. I seriously ALMOST buy this product until I turned over the package and saw this: Made in PXXXXXXXXXS (not Japan!). Instantaneously, I put back the item on the shelf and re-purchased the tape and lotion (both are made in Japan) instead. Now I know why the split review on the bracelets because the manufacturing source is different - this is my gut feel by the way. I rather tape around my body inconspiciously to mimick the jewellery claimed effect than buying the actual jewellery where the quality is questionable by my gut-feeling and so not comfortable in buying at all.

38892,"Ordered this item for a performance costume. The first copy came with a broken strand and the pearls rolling around in the shipping bag. We used the Amazon return process to return it and had a replacement within days. The second copy arrived in the exact same unusable condition. We can't try again, it wouldn't be available in time. Quality control on this product appears to be very bad.
",2
38904,"The image really looks much better than the actual product. Stones are quite brownish, not red as one would expect of garnet. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this.
",2
38905,"they ship really fast..which is nice, but ultimatly, this item reminds me too much of something that would come out of a 25 cent machine...it is a piece of crap and it looks a lot dinkier in real life then it does in the pictures, plus the stone is not ""garnet"" it more so resembles the color brown...like a turd.
",2
38918,"It took over a month to get my product from this company.I will not order from them again. When I did get the ear rings, they were much smaller than they seemed in the picture. It would be nice to have some sort of picture scale to see the size of the item being purchased.
",2
38919,"I had received the earrings I purchased on Amazon and they were supposed to be RED garnets. But their color is far closer to Amber than red (as was pictured) and I was very disappointed. I wrote my problem to Amazon and to date have had no response. I had asked back then to either send replacement pair sent (at NO additional shipping charges to ME) that someone actually CHECKS the color or I would send these back for a full refund. The style is very cute - I even like the accompanying necklace and ring designs - HOWEVER....I then wrote to 6 different departments at Amazon asking for help with an exchange --- to this day, WEEKS later, None of the departments has responded. The holidays are now passed - I have a gift I could not give.Disappointed.
",2
38932,"I just got this bracelet for Christmas. I have small wrists so it fits great, most bracelets are just too big for me. There are no sharp edges at all on the bracelet so it's great for wearing all the time, it won't catch on clothes or scratch my babies. The reason I only gave it 2 stars is that the pearls are not pink, they are peach. I got the matching earrings & necklace which both have PINK pearls so hopefully Amazon will exchange this bracelet so my new jewelry will match.
",2
38936,"I bought this bracelet with the intention of giving it to my 23 year old daughter. When I received it, I felt it was more for a young teenager. It is small for the average woman's wrist. The quality was disappointing.I thought it would be a more classic bracelet. Too young on an adults wrist
",2
38954,"Packing was not damaged but when my Granddaughter opened it on Christmas it was broken. Her father was able to glue it together but since outside of packing was not damaged at all, it had to have been packed for shipping already broken. She is using it but top drawers do not open at all. VERY disappointed with this for the money!!

39105,"I personally used the tape and the e-water lotion together and the combination effectively subdue my neck-shoulder ache which I have for many years. I applied the lotion daily after bath at night and replace the tape every 2-3 days. I am convinced with the technology that I decided to try their jewellery products since having the tape seen on body is not a pretty sight to public eye. Before I make any haste/impulse purchase, I googled for the product reviews and realised it is a mixed reviews - ~50:50 positive and negative. As I am convinced with what I have experienced with the tape and lotion effect, so I decided to trust my gut feeling to get the bracelet. I take it as the 50% negative reviews could be because the users do not have any pain/aches to begin with so they do not experience any ""miracle"". For example, if you have a flawless skin to begin with, you will not expect any miracle effect even if you apply La-mer/SKII/Lancome/Estee Lauder expensive skincare product daily. That's the logic. I seriously ALMOST buy this product until I turned over the package and saw this: Made in PXXXXXXXXXS (not Japan!). Instantaneously, I put back the item on the shelf and re-purchased the tape and lotion (both are made in Japan) instead. Now I know why the split review on the bracelets because the manufacturing source is different - this is my gut feel by the way.

",2
39241,"When I bought these earrings I didn't realize they would have words and little plastic eyes glued on to them. They are much more childish then I expected.
",2
39242,"the earrings were cheap made except the wire was silver. A sticker placed on a teardrop piece of metal I suppose it an steel alloy. One was off center and had a buckle in the sticker. It wasn't laying straight. Looks pretty in the picture but wasn't what I expected.
",2
39250,"The rubies in these earrings are very dull, and my pair looked crusty like they were not cut properly. I sent them back.
",2
39262,"I guess I did not realize they were SO big. They are almost 2 inches in diameter.
",2
39267,"They did not look as good as they did online. They were also supposed to be for non-pierced ears, but the clasp was extremely painful and dug into the earlobe. I bought these for my wedding and will NOT be wearing them.
",2
39268,"Even though the picture shows two earrings you only get one earring when you order so you have to order twice to get a complete pair. Also the barbed wire closure had to be pried off to put the earring on and now noone can put it back on.
",2
39271,"I bought this necklace to replace my sister's old one that I broke; and she was disappointed when she found out that the clasp did not work. It didn't snap back like it should, and she was surprised because this necklace was a $7.99 one, not a 1 dollar one. The silver tone looks a little too fake, but the heart is very pretty, she says.
",2
39321,"the item was not worth $3.99 on wraping. also it was not really in good shape. i had to fix some parts of the item before I gave it for gift. Also since the wraping was horrible, I had to unwrapped the item and wrap it myself.
",2
39329,"I'll need to change the clasps on these to a lobster claw; the size on these is huge because the kind of clasps used gives the bracelet (must be) an extra 1/2"" or so. So, it will not hang JUST loosely on my wrist; it slides all the way to the middle of my palm. And my hands are not small; I have average-size hands. I was very close to returning the item until I thought of the lobster claw modification, which is a great idea because it'd be a shame to have to return a sparkly bracelet that looks so nice.
",2
39339,"It is very shiny, but it looks fake because it has a strange coating on it to make it shiny. Swarovski crystal doesn't coat their products like that. Theirs catches lights naturally not like this one which depends on the coating. I have real swarovsski jewelry. When I wear them together, you can see great difference.
",2
39396,"my husband and I ordered this ring for our wedding bands. I can only wear sterling silver because of skin sensitivity...this ring IS NOT STERLING SILVER. My finger turned green after wearing it for only a few hours. there was no ""925"" stamp on the ring either like they said.I'm very disappointed.
",2
39411,"I bought this ring to replace my wedding ring after I broke my ring finger and my old ring didn't fit. When I got it, the ring seemed like cheap aluminum. I guess you get what you pay for. My daughter wears it now and likes it. That is why I gave it 2 stars.
",2
39442,"I agree with the previous reviewer that it was a little hard to get unkinked and came in a tight bag that I was aghast to see such a big necklace stuffed into. However, my main problem with the necklace, that while pretty, looked like something you'd buy for $5 at Claire's and not an expensive Zina necklace. If you need a gift for a young girl it would be pretty, but it's way too expensive for what it is (even at the $99 I paid).

39484,"it's ok. found something similar at red envelope but, they were out of stock. had hoped this would be a little ""more.""
",2
39516,"The 14k gold posts seemed to be good quality, comfortable for me to wear for weeks without causing any skin reaction on my super sensitive earlobes. The stones are lacking the sparkles, looks more like acrylic beads compared to the Amazon collection CZ stud earrings I've purchased.
",2
39523,"I decided to buy a gift for my mother, and I knew she would love this one, but when it arrived in the mail, I did not like it at all, it was too small, and four diamonds were missing, I just feel this was a waist of my money, and time. I have been buying on amazon for months now and everything that I have gotten has been up to my expectation, but this one.
",2
39542,"I don't want to return this item; however, I was a little disappointed - the quality of the chain wasn't the best in my opinion. The chain was a little too large and not what I expected (even though it was supposedly copper or copper coated). The Irish penny was very lightweight. I think the item would have looked so much better on a nice silver chain ... a little more streamlined. I'm sorry to say, that I'm not happy with this product; however, it was given as a gift so I won't be returning it.

39559,"i ordered these earring and was disappointed with them. It was my fault as they had the dimensions listed. Not my style at all.

",2
39605,"I don't recall when I bought this ring that there were two separate rings pictured. I only recall seeing the close up one with the thicker cross and then a customer image on a finger. Pictures 2 and 3 (which are actually the same as another reviewer noted) are NOT the same ring as the first one pictured. I really wanted what is pictured in the first one. The cross is thicker and much more noticeable. It's more solid and weighty looking. The ring I got is the second one pictured which has a much thinner cross and looks more dainty than weighty. Now, it's not an ugly or cheap ring... it's just not what I wanted. I wanted the thicker looking one. I'm a guitar player and wanted it to be seen from stage while I'm playing. The one I got just won't do that.If you want what's in the first picture, do not buy this ring. If you're OK with how the one in the second picture looks, go ahead and buy it. It fits true to size and is nice for what it is... it's just not what I expected and wanted.

39666,"The clasp broke the third time I wore it. I really loved the colors because you could wear it with so many things. I didn't feel like going through the whole return thing.
",2
39669,"I really liked these earrings but they are so heavy I can't wear them.I think the metal chosen was of a less than perfect metal...meaning extra cheap.Don't buy these earrings unless you like the idea of your ear being ripped open at any given moment.
",2
39685,"I was disappointed with this bracelet. The stones were too light and it wasn't great quality. You could only see the silver on the bracelet because the stones faded into the silver due to their lack of color. I returned this item.
",2
39705,"I recently purchased these earrings, it looked great as pictured, but was disappointed on the setting of the stone, it stands to far out from the ear when worn.
",2
39714,"the ring is ok. just ok. it's thinner silver than i thought it'd be, so it probably won't last forever. very shiny, but it'll dull down as i wear it. it took many many weeks to arrive and i contacted the seller more than 4 times w/ no response. i would never buy from this seller again.

39761,"I ordered this charm as part of a birthday gift of a charm bracelet for a friend in Minneapolis, along with two other charms. My friend wears the bracelet daily, but has opted to wear the single Tiffany heart charm I included, and I agree the bracelet looks better that way.This charm is cute, a novelty, but not of great quality, and not particularly pretty.
",2
39782,"I like things that say ""Live Laugh Love,"" so my boyfriend got this for me for my birthday. After wearing it a few times, it was clear the quality isn't good. It got scratched, and looked tarnished/faded! And I only wore it to work, nothing crazy!

",2
39848,"These are nice looking earrings, but the package says that they contain a chemical that is known to be cancerous in California. As a result, the package says that they are not for kids aged 12 and under. It would have been nice to know that before I bought them for my nine-year old daughter,
",2
39891,"This ring arrived with visible fuse lines on the inside and outside. It is feather light, and is obviously hollow. Not ""solid"" whatsoever. Not worth the shipping, much less the cost of purchase. Probably not .925 sterling (couldn't have it tested, as there is not enough metal mass to have it done).

39898,"This looked very pretty. I wore it every day for about a month when I noticed it had a large dent in it. Not nearly as pretty as it appeared on the computer screen.No longer wear it.

39933,"I ordered a Swarovsky crystal pendant which I thought was clear like one I had purchased once on a visit to a Swarovsky factory. The one I received is clear but not like the first one. It is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one. I was disappointed.
",2
39947,"scoundrels!, say 7 pieces and do not specify that. deceivers!, with the cover image. why not say that the 7 PIECES are rings. That is very wrong!. repent and change that picture. the time of exchange was gold mirrors for centuries

",2
39972,"I bought these and they were nice enough but they broke within one week just from trying to take them out and put them in.Also shipping form the seller is an extra 5 bucks.
",2
39979,"A mighty small amount of gold for the money. Actually, I returned this ring. It did not match my 14 kt white gold engagement ring. Looked like a different color metal. ALSO...I found this ring in 14 kt. white gold, same mm width at a big blue box retailer & it did match my ring...and for $27.00 and change !!! Weighed exactly the same so why spend more money?

I would send it back but I need it to go with a rosary box I purchased and I dont have time to find another one, on or off line.It is disappointing.

40135,"These earrings are for a baby - they're so tiny. I erred in buying these for myself, but had a relative's child to give them to.
",2
40182,"The details of this necklace are kind of misleading. The black string that came with the necklace was kind of cheap and the pendant itself was nothing special. It is obviously fake and looks more gaudy than unique. I was under the impression that this was actual silver...its not.
",2
40201,"I absolutely loved this bracelet. Unfortunately, while at the Celtic Festival in Belfast, I lost it. It was exquiste and just what I wanted. Not to worry, however, as with Amazon I can certaily order it again!Thank you so much for such a beautiful piece at such an affordable price.
",2
40213,"I was so disappointed with this item! It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for a fossil-loving friend. It looked like a necklace from a 50 cent machine. I had to get her a new gift.
",2
40219,"This item came promptly and I like the way it looked...but in a matter of 2 days the chain broke and I now have nothing to show for it...maybe better just to get a pendent with no chain..if thats all they can afford to put on their product..
",2
40232,"This item is TINY. I wanted to wear it myself, but it is way too small. I will send it to my 3 year old niece.
",2
40247,"It's a delicate pendant. The length is about the size of a penny coin. The actual product has a flat surface across the whole pendant while the pictures shows more 3-D looking loops. I suggest Amazon includes additional pictures to show product from an angle. The length of the chain is 18 inches which is same as the description.
",2
40262,"the pendant is very small and light and has a cheap silver finish that does not look like our other sterling products. The return postage makes it not practical to refund. We were very regretful with this purchase.
",2
40269,"I bought this as a gift for a younger teenager and I think it is nice enough for the price. I got it at a promotional price. the charm was nice but the chain was so small and tiny you couldn't grab it to fasten it. wouldn't recommend.
",2
40273,"This product looks beautiful but it is TINY! It is definitely too small for an adult and too fragile for a child.
",2
40278,"I am very disappointed in this necklace/pendant. It is way smaller than I expected. In the amazon.com description it said, 'small' but this is smaller than a dime. The chain is shorter than 18"" even with the 2"" extender. I think this should be listed as a young persons necklace/pendant...maybe for a petite teen or someone. I gave it 2 stars only because I think a teen would love it, and the fit would be more appropriate. I think I will take the cross off of the chain and hang it (the cross) on my charm bracelet. :)Next time show the size next to a coin or something so we have an idea of the exact size of jewelry, etc.
",2
40283,"The cross is very pretty, but much smaller than I had anticipated. I was hoping for one a bit larger to give as a gift.
",2
40291,"I ordered this as a gift and had to return it. The silver was poor quality and had markings on it that I could not remove.
",2
40295,"the frogs in the picture are even smaller in person, and the bracelet barley fit in my wrist (i have very small wrists). you should buy an extender for this bracelet just in case.
",2
40335,"Bought this for a gift. With the suede necklace, it looked nice. Then it arrived. To my surprise the Amber Stone was HUGE! I mean really large. Bigger than a dollar coin.The person claimed to like it, but I have my doubts. Never seen it worn.
",2
40352,"The pendant was larger than I expected, but the chain was garbage. It was way too long and flimsy and the clasp was broken.
",2
40354,"For what they cost I guess you can't complain BUT they are cheap looking in personwouldn't buy again
",2
40366,"I was disappointed in the color of the stones. I also couldn't figure out how to open the leverback (it didn't seem to have a hinge and I was afraid of breaking it if I forced it open). I returned the earrings and was very pleased at the speed at which I got a refund.
",2
40384,"The necklace arrived and I've spent 30 mins untangling it and still haven't gotten it untangled. The pearl looks like it's squished onto the necklace. Overall not happy, and since I don't know how it will look on me until it gets untangled. I am very disappointed in this product.
",2
40391,"The design looks nice, but the title &quot;tough guy&quot; is a little misleading. I bought this as part of a Christmas gift for my brother, but the band would not go all the way around his wrist. It fit his skinny girlfriend all right, however. We also had to use the pliers on one of the snaps because a piece of metal stuck out in the way of the snap so that it didn't close properly. The name should be changed to tough-girl's band.
",2
40394,"Product looks exactly like it was described and came in a small bag that wasn't opened. However, I haven't even worn it because the ball is extremely too big, it's actually bigger than any other tongue ring ball I've seen. Very uncomfortable.
",2
40427,"In the photo of these earrings, the setting appears to be substantial. In reality, it much too delicate and flimsy for stones of this size.
",2
40429,"Personally didn't like how the stalk wasn't centered in the earring with the stud, instead it's placed below the stud. Makes the earrings LOOK CHEAP. They look a lot better in the pictures.
",2
40458,"The chain is rather thin and almost white looking rather than silvery. I had to return it because it was not worth $80 and the ring of the lobster clasp was missing. Dealing with the seller was a problem. I did not get a response for return authorization until I reported them to Amazon. Now I am waiting for my money to be returned after 4 weeks. What is going on with this seller. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!

40509,"You get what you pay for, I guess. The armoire looks nice in the pictures, but in person the shoddy construction is extremely obvious. It's not made of wood; most of the body is made from particle board with wood veneer. The particle board is visible whenever any of the drawers are opened. The drawers themselves are also particle board with wooden face plates. When I unpackaged mine, I found that one of the drawer face plates had completely fallen off, and another was cracked. There are weird gaps between the drawer body and the face plate, that look like a design mistake that they tried to cover up. It also reveals that the drawers are not squared off properly, because the gaps are uneven on each side of the drawers. The hardware looks tacky, for example the drawer handles look like cheap bronze castings that were crudely screwed on with the type of cheap brass screws you get from home depot. The screws don't match the hardware - while the hardware has a faux antique finish, the screws are bright gold, not recessed, and highly visible.I'm actually kinda glad that mine arrived damaged because that means I get to return it. Two stars for now assuming they don't give me any trouble with the return; if I have trouble actually returning this I'll downgrade them to one star.
",2
40516,"The armoire is a pretty piece of furniture but smaller than I had expected. Unfortunately, I had to return it. My fault, I should have paid attenion to the measurements.
",2
40520,"I was considering buying this armoire, but after doing some detective work I found that the majority of the 5 star reviews, are those customers only reviews. Very fishy don't you think?
",2
40553,"I was disappointed with several aspects of this purchase. First I was told it would be delivered within two weeks of purchase. When the two weeks passed and I did not receive any notification as to a delivery date, I contacted the vendor. I was informed delivery would be delayed for several weeks. I believe the vendor should have notified me there would be a delay before I had to inquire about it. Second, when I finally received the armoire, one of the drawers was falling apart. Fortunately I was able to repair it because it would have been impossible to send it back to have it repaired. This was a disappointing purchase.
",2
40577,"This is a pretty pendant, but it is flat, not three dimensional. You can't really see that from the product description. I sent it back.
",2
40587,"Cute earrings, but alot smaller than what the picture leads you to believe. I would not have bought them had there been a measurment description.

40598,"I bought this item for myself for mother's day and when I got it I was disapointed. The item is very small. But it is pretty in a way.
",2
40606,"I ordered this ring expecting it to be as pictured, but what was delivered didn't match either the visual nor written description! I got a thin ""Yellow Gold"" ring! Not the ""Tricolored"" Gold ring as pictured, and not the ""Rose"" Gold ring as described! Needless to say I am having my wife return this as soon as possible!
",2
40610,"The stones and setting were nice, but the post was so short and clamp was so small that I couldn't wear them - had to give them away to a ""tiny"" person.
",2
40619,"Weight noted is per earring - NOT total carat weight. Too large for second (back) earring on my ears.As a result, I wasted nearly $10 for shipping from and back to because the description was unclear.Received item quickly and received credit for return quickly or rating would be lower.
",2
40620,"The earrings were specifically cheap, I understand, but holding them closely you can see that the final cut shows a large square on the top of one earring and a tiny square on the top of the other earring. I guess when they arent together they will look fine but dont expect the earrings to look the same at all they are completely different but the same size. could have been better since they are in white gold, I would expect this lack of cut symetry in sterling......buyer beware....
",2
40634,"Agree with TD. The gold is not as pictured. It is very thin wire and the post bent the first time I put the back on one of the earrings. Sabrina Silver was prompt in refunding my money upon return, but I'm out the shipping. I would not recommend this product.
",2
40635,"Not as pictured. Stone is ok,but the gold part is very cheap looking, would not buy again... would not recomend.
",2
40673,"I've ordered several inexpensive necklaces of a similar type to this one, all of which I've been happy with. This necklace was the exception to the rule, and is the only one I've never worn. This pendant looks nice enough, but there's a problematic design flaw. The cord or chain you use to hang the pendant around your neck goes through a metal loop which is behind the hilt of the sword (you can see this loop in one of the available images of the item). Unfortunately, this loop is over-sized and sticks out. Because it sticks out so far on the backside that should be laying against your chest, the sword is made to rest awkwardly and has to tip to one side or the other. There are a lot of other great necklaces for around this price, so I suggest you purchase one of the others which don't have this problem.

",2
40720,"The stones looked good but the metal is a little whimpier than what amazon pictured.I only give it 2 stars because the backs did not fit snug enough to keep the earrings on and one fell out the first day I wore them. So due to the faulty backs I no longer have a pair of earrings. I emailed to see if I could return just the one, and they did get right back to me, but with a no. They did say however that I could purchase one for $14.57 plus shipping by calling them... not worth it!

40730,"I was surprised when this arrived how very tiny it is. it is lovely - just much smaller than I had expected.
",2
40732,"When I received the pendant I was not happy with the fact that it was so small. I can hardly see the dragon. It was a lot of money for what I got but had to keep it since I had no time to get another piece of jewelry.

40742,"The charm did not arrive in a timely manner after purchase and the charm was flat on one side with the design on the other side only. The description given could have been better explaining the design of the charm. Most likely will not purchase from this site again in the future.

40757,"The earrings came in a cheap looking blue cardboard box and a tiny black pouch made out of crummy velveteen.They were gorgeous, and I absolutely adored them... until the back fell off of one and I had to trek back through O'Hare airport to find it on my previous plane over the holiday. I replaced the back with a different one, and thanked my lucky stars...Vacation came and went, I went back to work and lo and behold, the same thing happened with the other earring; of which I hadn't replaced the original back. This time I wasn't so fortunate- and I haven't found the earring.My advice, replace the backs before use. If giving as a gift, also repackage.
",2
40763,"You will be shocked with the real size, which is much less than on the picture!
",2
40788,"Unlike previous reviewer I got a purple one, but the enameling was bad quality and the black outline on the star was missing in places, and there was still scrap from the casting around the edges. It wasn't expensive but even so I expected better quality.
",2
40796,"The bracelet I received had very small chips. It would be ok for a child or someone who wanted a small bracelet, but if you want something bigger, this is not for you. It looked small even on my six inch wrist. I returned it. Maybe I'm expecting too much for $1.99.
",2
40810,"Received as promised. Much larger than anticipated. Cheesy necklace. Will wait 'til opened at Christmas. May be returning this one.
",2
40812,"The pendent is really neat and the perfect size, however the cord is not good quality. I will resume wearing the pendant as soon as I find a chain for it. The cord looked ragged after wearing it once and snapped, breaking completely when I adjusted the size to take the necklace off.
",2
40837,"Literally broke the third day I had it. Chain didn't break it was the locket. Also opened on its own all my pictures fell out before I lost it. Also no way to keep photos dry if you sweat or get rained on or shower or do anything with any kind of moisture.
",2
40839,"I loved the thought of this item. I have 5 kids so a general locket wouldn't work for me. Within 20 min of me having this locket in my possession the lock messed up. It also tarnishes very easy and is hard to polish. It didn't state that it didn't come with a chain so I had to purchase one. Picture are difficult to put in.
",2
40847,"The earrings are small little peace for everyday wear.I bought the earrings when I saw discount of 98 %,I thought they will be good piece of jewellery, in fact they do not worth more than 500 $.
",2
40852,"The bracelet arrived in a timely manner and I loved it! But two of the eyes broke off within a week of owning the bracelet. I also bought the turquoise color from the same seller and that one broke as well. I love the bracelets but I'm hoping to find someone to buy from who makes them of better quality.

",2
40950,"We bought this item as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law, who recently underwent breast cancer treatment (and has now been given a clean bill of health). We were disappointed in the pendant's small size and general lack of bling. The chain is also quite delicate (translation: thin and cheap). We needed something delivered by the holiday and this was the only one we found available. Receipt was quick, but the item was overpriced in our opinion. It's probably worth half the cost at most. (Yes, I appreciate that part of the proceeds are donated to breast cancer charity.) It's not very pink in color.
",2
40966,"I'm sure that this product does what it says it does, but I can't tell you for sure, because it never reached me. I ordered the delicate gem and pearl cleaner for my engagement ring, which has pearls in the setting. What I received was the standard formula which clearly states that it is not safe to use on pearls. I've never had this problem with Amazon before, but needless to say I'm very disappointed.
",2
40967,"While clearly brand new and sealed, the product DID NOT come with a jewelry brush as the description indicated. Neither was one mentioned on the outside of the product itself. Now I'm trying to find a seperate jewelry brush to use with the product as I don't have one kicking around already...what a pain.
",2
40969,"This stuff is expensive. Especially considering how well it works. A little lemon joy and warm water works much better and does not leave a film behind. Will keep looking for a safe cleaner.
",2
40974,"These earrings are really pretty, but one of the stones fell out the third time I wore them. I did not wear them for long periods and only wore them when I was sitting. So pretty but poor workmanship.
",2
40998,"I do mean tiny earrings. Loved them because I could keep them in at night, but easily lost one of them because they were so tiny I couldn't find it in the carpet.
",2
41060,"I ordered this to clean my new engagement ring. The cleaner works well, but does leave a little bit of a sticky feeling on my hands and my ring despite rinsing repeatedly. The worst part about it though is that the cap does not seem to screw on securely and it is constantly leaking. I would not recommend this product because of this. I ordered a different brand of cleaner to replace it.
",2
41061,"Jewelry came out just as bad as it went in. Toothbrush and toothpaste does a far better job. Waste of money.
",2
41065,"I bought this product to clean my silver jewelry. It cleaned it somewhat but I have had to put it in the cleaner more then once and for an extended period of time. Really not satisfied with the results. I would not recommend this product.
",2
41071,"not happy at all with the results, I got this item to clean my silver, I have no idea if i got the wrong one ... I used to have one silver cleaner and once i dip the silver and in 5 sec looked like new, anyway I should read more reviews before purchase it, thanks
",2
41072,"I saw all the positive reviews so I bought this cleaner. It is odorless, but it hasn't been able to clean any of my sterling silver jewelry! I followed the directions and my jewelry is still dull looking. I paid a lot for this cleaner and shipping it to me cost as much as the cleaner itself! Talk about frustrated and disappointed. Next time, I will buy a cleaner from an area variety store. It can't be any worse as far as effectiveness and this way I can return it in person should it not work.
",2
41074,"This product for starters - once opened LEAKS!. The cleaning is mediocre. Not worth it. Thank god it was only a few bucks.
",2
41082,"We usually buy similar product from Target which was very very good. I wanted to try this one, but we are not at all satisfied with the results. We have poured almost all the liquid on a silver plate. But there is no difference at all.Then we tried the same old product, it was amazing.I recommend ""Connoisseurs Revitalizing Silver Jewelry Cleaner"".
",2
41092,"the cleaner works fine but the jar it comes in is not well made and it is difficult to open and close. It makes a mess every time I use it. The last jar I had was made from better material, but this is just junk!!! I will not purchase this item again.
",2
41106,"I ordered many rings and this one I am not going to keep - will give it away as a present. It is ok. The quality is good, I just don't like the way it looks. It is too plain in reality, not sparkling.
",2
41119,"I bought this bracelet and the matching earrings as a Christmas gift and I REALLY wanted to like them. I was encouraged by all of the positive reviews and was looking forward to getting them in the mail. I was very surprised to find I didn't really like them when I opened them. I have other Swarovski jewelry and absolutely love it, the quality of the crystals look like really nice expensive gems. These look cheap. It does have some sparkle to it, but the colors are really muted and they almost look like plastic beads. Also, I have to agree with the reviewer who commented on the gradation of the crystals. The ones in the middle of the bracelet are significantly bigger and I think it would look much better if they were all the same size. The person I gave it to seemed to like it, so maybe it was just me (or maybe they were just trying to be nice). It's not very often I write negative reviews about anything, I was just so surprised that I didn't like this I felt like I had to share my opinion.
",2
41161,"This belly ring is MUCH LARGER than I had expected, is crooked, and just not what I thought it was... It sticks out kinda far and is sort of gaudy,... Hope this helps...
",2
41185,"The color of the stones are not like they look on the picture. They are look brighter and look like they are colored glass.
",2
41224,"These earrings are small but pretty. One of the clasps did not close properly and I should have sent them back. Of course, I lost one within two months. Not a good buy!
",2
41251,"Ok, I bought this as a gift for sister who became a first time mother after a long battle with infertility. It looked great here but once I received it not so much. First I will say that the seller has no tracking, so you have no idea when you will get your package. When I received it finally, I was disappointed because it came to me all DIRTY. I had to go to a local jeweler the day before Christmas to get it cleaned, while the pendant is nice the chain could have been a little bit better. Also the card they show in the picture with the nice poem was NOT the card that I received with it, the one I received had nothing to do with it. I would NEVER order from this seller ever again.
",2
41253,"The necklace is nicely made, but the rectangles are very small and I am disappointed with this. This is probably a child's necklace rather than an adult one. Had I known the sizes of the rectangles, I would have not bought this necklace. However, as it was not expensive I am keeping it as a future present.
",2
41288,"The Sandelli - 14k Gold Onyx with tigers-Eye Drop earrings were too loose for my ear and I lost one of the earrings. As a jewelry maker I know when I'm making a set of earrings, the fish hook have the tendency to slip out of the ear. And should have included the little rubber stoppers with their product. It's a smaill thing to build customer relations and loyalty. I even called and spoke to someone in the store asking to buy one earring if they had such a thing. I was reassured they did have extras earrings and would send me out one. Well I'm still waiting and it's been 3 years. Buyer Beware!!!
",2
41311,"I wouldn't pay good money to have the potential to lose one or both earrings because the ear wire is not secure. It is better to purchase earrings with locking ear wires, that is if you plan on keeping them for any length of time.
",2
41312,"I was disappointed when I received these earrings. The emeralds were cloudy and very small. I returned them.
",2
41316,"I really don't understand how to wear these earrings. They are flimsy so I guess you're just supposed to pry them apart and shove them on your ears but I'm not sure how long the earrings or my ears will last at that rate! I'd pass on these...
",2
41354,"These earrings were very inexpensive. I would rather have paid more and gotten a pair of earrings with a better clasp. They're also a little too small, but that was my fault for not looking at the specifications closely.I love the style, but I wish whoever makes these could use a better design. They're hard to put on and the metal bends easily.
",2
41376,"The pendant is really cute, but has a silver skin back to increase the brightness. The swarovski's jewelry what I see in stores do not have this device.
",2
41400,"I bought this because well it's a beautiful ring and looks so real. But after a week of wearing it my ring finger turned green. It's not real silver. I still think it's beautiful and the stones like so real but I guess you get what you pay for.
",2
41426,"Only lasted a dozen uses before it stopped hanging on well. I would not bother with this product. In this case quality does matter 100%.
",2
41431,"This bracelet is of good quality with a nice clasp. It's good looking but it is so small. I have a very small and thin wrist and it is tight with very little slack. It's so small that it's kind of uncomfortable. This seems to have been made for a child but it was not marked that way.
",2
41435,"I got these for my wife as she had been looking for a pair of square hoops for a while without luck. She only wore them a few times and the post broke off one of the earrings.
",2
41437,"The main complaint about these earrings is that they are heavy. I can't keep them in my ears for a long period of time without them hurting. The other problem is they were smaller then I expected, I didn't expect them to be huge but I also didn't expect them to be as small as they were. Other than that, they are a cute pair of earring and different from the standard hoops that we normally see.So, if your used to wearing heavy earrings these might not bother you. However if you tend to wear light earrings or only wear them every once in a while,like I do,I would suggest not getting these.
",2
41447,"They seem like nice earrings, very glossy and modern, but I'm not comfortable wearing them. The circle on these earrings is almost as big as a dime, but much heavier. I thought I was buying something less chunky; my taste is for smaller earrings. I wish Amazon would publish size measurements.
",2
41454,"I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS RING-IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL ONLINE-BUT IN PERSON IS A FLIMSY-CZ-THAT LOOKS LIKE A VENDING MACHINE RING,IT IS DECEIVING.IF YOU WANT A NICE BAND-DON'T BUY THIS ONE.
",2
41455,"I gotthis ring but I do not like it because it snags on everything like clothing and your skin. I do not suggest anyone to buythis ring.
",2
41470,"It's beautiful and I get many people tell me how pretty it is, but after you wear it a couple of weeks, it leaves a black mark around your finger that doesn't wash completely off for several days.
",2
41495,"I have been looking at this ring for a few weeks and decided on buying because of its great reviews. However when I got the ring I was very disappointed. The diamonds on the sides looked glued on, it was not aligned correctly and stick out far enough to where it is uncomfortable, the craftmanship is poor and the diamond looks fake. I have to point out on the positive that the ring got to my home sooner than I expected but the box it came in looked rather ""dollar store-ish"". Company is fast and reliable, product is poor.
",2
41496,"This is supposed to be a nickel free ring. I'm pregnant so I needed a bigger wedding ring for my pregnant fingers and didn't want to spend a ton. This worked last pregnancy with another ring that I wore for months without issue until it broke (another ""cheapy"" ring). Anyway, I was worried about having a reaction since my skin is sensitive and was excited that the ring said nickel free.I've worn it for 2 days and couldn't wear it any more because of the itchy rash it left under where the ring touched my finger. Maybe it doesn't have nickel, but it's definitely not hypoallergenic. I realize that it wasn't advertised as such but buyer beware if you are looking for a ring to be gentle to your sensitive skin.I will also second the ill fitting of the pair. The two rings never fit together correctly and constantly have to be moved into place. I was actually pretty disappointed with how the ring looked in person. The large CZ was nice but the detailing on the sides looks pretty cheap.
",2
41513,"this ring is not so great one is a little bit bigger then the other they dont stay together dont even wear them would'nt order again disapointed
",2
41515,"This ring set looks very nice in the picture. But, upon receiving it looks very cheap, and the two pieces do not stay together. Most of the reviews were good, so I thought it would be much better. Won't wear this one much.
",2
41537,"Really loved the ring, but the stone was not secured in place and fell out after a few days. I have still not gotten around to having it repaired. Disappointed because I loved the design, but be warned that your stone may fall out too. I was just lucky to save the stone.
",2
41590,"The ring is beautiful, however, it's huge. I wanted to wear it on my ring finger but I would suggest get it for your middle finger if you want it. Also the ring came in the wrong size. I ordered a 5 and it was a 5.5; someone had said their ring sizes run small - however, I found them to run big. But basically it seems there is no consistency with the ring sizes. I have bought several size 5 rings and never had a problem. I returned the ring and was not refunded my shipping even though the sizing was incorrect.
",2
41603,"When the necklace arrived I was so happy. It shifted from baby blue to a peachy-orange in the light and if the sun hit it right small hearts were reflected onto the nearby walls and ceiling. I'm not sure whether I was too rough with it, but after noticing that I had strange scratches on my chest I inspected the necklace and realized it had chipped. I never dropped the necklace or smacked it around but it had one large chip at the end of the point of a flake and another small one. I can no longer wear the necklace because it leaves scratches all across my chest, and am very disappointed. Perhaps if I purchased a longer chain I would not have this problem. But a necklace should not be so fragile. Be careful with it if you do decide to buy it.
",2
41604,"I'm highly allergic to nickel, it's my only allergy so I bought this item since it was supposed to be a sterling silver thing to connect it to the chain. It must have had nickel since I had a severe reaction to them with a short while of wearing it. Also their necklace chains caused severe reaction as well.Other than the nickel problem it is a very beautiful necklace and very pretty in the sun, would highly recommend if you have no nickel problem.
",2
41620,"They looked great online, but when I received them, the flower cut was cheap-looking & the color wasn't a rich red. Instead, it was an orangy-redish streaky color. Blech. Don't waste your money.
",2
41653,"This barbell looks beautiful on amazon but, once you receive it? You might not be too happy. The ball is clear but, you can see the bar through the ball, the wings look terrible and the gem is too large for something this small.
",2
41690,"I was disappointed when I saw the armoire in person. It's not nearly as pretty as in the picture. It's actually rather dull. I must admit I was influenced by the rave reviews of others. The quality was lacking, I believe it is overpriced. I was sorely disappointed.S.D.
",2
41718,"The glass heart itself is nice, but the other beads on the necklace are really cheap looking - like the kind you imagine kids using in preschool. Still, some people have complimented me on it. It's cute in a ""fun"" way.
",2
41742,"I wish the piece would have stayed shiny longer than 9 months. After that, the Rhodium plating began peeling off. Of course the company that sells the necklace doesn't offer any type of warranty. They told me to take it to a jeweler to have it re-Rhodiumed... Yea, like that'll cost less than the money I paid for the necklace.It was beautiful while it lasted.
",2
41824,"looks great, fits great, but after one day of wear i was having a skin reaction under the band. i kept it on for another day and it kept getting worse. i switched hands to be sure and had the same problem. it took a week for the rash to go away. at least it was cheap, but still annoying.
",2
41828,"beautiful color, but very small in size, i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the picture
",2
41845,"Ordered easily and received promptly.The pendant is cheap, flimsy and disappointing. This came the day before Christmas, if I'd had time to purchase something else, I would have. I was extremely disappointed in every aspect of the quality, and embarrassed to give it as a gift. $50. would have been overpaying.
",2
41870,"When I viewed this particular ring it looked really nice and small & somewhat what I was looking for I am just in question on why the stone seems to be so cloudy? I use high quality jewerly cleaner & it still comes out looking dull. I realize the stone is very small & delicate but am not too impressed by the quality.
",2
41871,"This pin is even prettier than the picture. The only problem, and it is a problem, is that the choice of the stick pin is poor if you plan to use this on any type of fabric that has a tighter weave (suiting, blouses). It would be good on loose weave sweaters, or perhaps wool, but unless the back pin is revised to make the tip rounded and the actual width of the needle much narrower (say like the size of a small eye sewing needle), it's not practical for wearing because it will leave large holes in your clothing. Too bad!
",2
41886,"I prefer to purchse the smallest CZs because they tend to look more realistic than larger stones. I ordered 2 pair, because i tend to lose earrings, which is why I don't buy ""the real thing"". The settings are really flimsy. The CZ was not well attached in the setting. Of the four earrings received, one CZ had already fallen out before delivery, and one was at an angle. I reset them using tweezers and a magnifying glass.Basically, with this product you get what you pay for. I would recommend going up a notch in price and getting a more solid setting rather than the 4-prong setting in very thin gold that these earrings come with. It gets two stars, because even for a somewhat low price, you are not quite getting what you pay for. They should at least hold together.
",2
41893,"I received these earrings in the mail today and am having to return them already. They are nice earrings but I opened the box and one of the posts was broken off. To say the least I was very disappointed I love this style of earring and wear them all the time so I thought I would get sterling silver to wear and not worry about them turning green or hurting my ear, like the cheap ones you buy at other stores, but at least they don't fall apart before you even get to wear them
",2
41899,"These earrings had great reviews for the most part, and, in the picture, they look elegant. I know they are inexpensive, but I did not expect them to look cheap. The silver is uneven and rough in places. The bend is haphazard and different between the two earrings (glaringly so) in both bend width and section length. When in my ears, one hung longer than the other, and one had a longer ""tail"" in the back than the other. I tried to re-bend the wide bend and the minute I grabbed the two sections, I felt like the bend would break. I wanted some simple, plain silver earrings I could wear with a cocktail dress, but these are definitely NOT them. I wouldn't wear these with jeans out in the horse pasture. I will return them as soon as possible, and I'm sorry I have to pay the return shipping because these aren't even worth that.
",2
41900,"Way wider than the picture suggests, also the post comes down farther than the bottom of the earring giving an odd appearance to the jewelry when worn.
",2
41950,"This product has really good looking stones, the band is bad. I sent the first one back after 3-1/2 wks it was turning. The second one is just as bad. I am going to try & have a band make to put the stones in.
",2
41952,"The bracelet arrived in a plastic bag (not the most impressive gift packaging), was 8 inches in length (which is HUGE when it comes to a girls wrist) and the construction is cheap. For $30? You get 2 stars.
",2
41956,"It's cheaper than it looks. Lucky for me it was a gag gif for a 50 year old Barbie nut who wanted a new Jewelery Box. But the drawers are sticky, and have edges. I wouldn't buy this for a child.
",2
42001,"Although the bracelet itself is well made it has such thin vermeil that it wore off after a few days of use-now I have a silver bracelet that was sold as vermeil.
",2
42012,"The first day i got it i was really excited but after an hour of playing around with it it broke. Very low quality. Trying to fix it at a jewellery store. If you buy it, treat it with lots of care.
",2
42069,"Received product promptly and a week sooner than I thought. The product fit well and was comfortably. However for my liking it was not heavy enough and did not look like the picture. Very little black on ring. So little it blends in and makes the ring look dull and antique.
",2
42093,"This item was rather embarrassing; it doe not have the shadows and 'embossed' look it appears to have in the photo. More of a flat surface, cut-out, design.
",2
42106,"My boyfriend bought me this seahorse necklace. It has a very cute, and tribal-like design. I wear it a lot. The BIG problem though is the string broke the first day I recived it, not only that. . . the metal thing that holds the string in broke as well. He had to buy a new string, a drill a new holder for the string to go into. Definently not worth $10 something plus shipping. It was a terrific gift, and I appreciate it. But i'm a bit dissapointed in the quality of this item, and so is my boyfriend.
",2
42122,"I bought two of this item - the silver heart shaped prayer box necklace - for Chrismas presents. While the heart pendant itself was pretty, it just didn't look right to me on the necklace it comes with. The chain is beautiful but a brighter silver than then antique look of the pendant. So it just didn't seem to match. I ended up returning both necklaces. In my opinion, a better purchase for half the price from this same company is the sterling silver small oxidized ""filigree heart"" pendant. I bought that for myself and love it.
",2
42163,"As one should expect from a name like ""Cuff Daddy"", these are huge. Completely useless for anything but costumes.They do look like the picture, but they are so big that the effect is far different. They arrived in a nice box, and without damage.
",2
42171,"it is too much bigger than i imagined. edges are very sharp. i dont really use it after i get.
",2
42179,"I recieved this fast that is why I gave it 2 stars. The down side it was not nearly as clean cut as the picture shows, it appears like there were snags or something in the metal giving it a ruffer apperance.I loved the whole adjustable knot rope that is attached until my boyfriend went to put it on the first time and the knot broke. It would probably take more time and effort to try to get a replacement, so most likely I will just find a different kind of rope for the chain. My boyfriend loved that phenoix because it repersents something special to us. I just wish it would have been of better quailty, but i didn't expect a whole lot for the price.
",2
42187,"it looks great but the cord got knotted and i had to cut it off my neck.
",2
42208,"I received this pendant yesterday and I can say it's not what I wanted. The size of the pendant is too big to have it around my neck. It would be a good idea to put a real picture with the pendant hanging from the neck to see the size. If I had known it was so big I wouldn't have ordered it and it's a pity because it's really beautiful but for what, decoration?
",2
42249,"looks really good online and people gave it really good reviews which is why I bought it for my mother in law for an upcoming birthday. However the chain is really thin and there is a loop on the pendant that doesn't lay flat when you wear it. I am keeping it because I am running out of time but this should be under $100 and not as much as it is.
",2
42253,"I bought this for a friend and it looks very beautiful! However after just a months wearing one stone fell out, and within a couple of hours two more stones fell out. For this price I would very much expect better quality. I certainly will not be buying Amazon produced jewelry again...
",2
42255,"Not what i expected, was a bit small...but again its always hard to judge something like this via the web...i will stick to the store.
",2
42263,"I'll be brief, looks clear, even with a piece of white paper behind it. Still attractive, but as a birthday gift intended to include birthstones it is disappointing.
",2
42264,"I was dispappointed with how light the gemstones were. They are very pale, and some are darker than the others. I would not buy this again.
",2
42265,"I purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother. I am very disappointed in the quality of the product.

42581,"I really did like this bracelet. It was easy to adjust but after I wore it a few times, the leather straps fell out of the ties. I haven't tried to fix it yet, not sure how to make that work nicely. I really liked how it looked, but couldn't give it more than 2 stars because it fell apart too easily.

42965,"I recently purchased this ring, and I must say that it is nice. The only problem is that the words ""Amazon"" are engraved on the inside of the ring, so if you want to place your own engraving it will be tough. I emailed customer support, and there is no way to purchase a ring without the ""Amazon"" stamp.

",3
63,"I purchased this necklace as a gift. At the amount it is was discounted, I thought I would be getting the most amazing deal for the price. The necklace I recieved was as pictured, but the stones where smaller than I believed them to be.The necklace is pretty, delicate, and was still a nice gift. The stones are a very nice light blue color. However, the original price before discount was extremely overinflated. I would never in a million paid over $150 for this necklace. The necklace doesn't look expensive, and the links made them look moderately cheap. My price (about $30) was probably the correct value, disguised as a deep discount.
",3
70,"I first ordered this thinking it was incredibly cheap without realizing that this is for ONLY ONE EARRING forcing me to buy a second. While it is still relatively inexpensive and my wife did not have any adverse reactions to the post material, the diamonds are very very small and can be difficult to see with the size of the mount.",3
79,"Bought these recently when Amazon was running a special of $15.00 off on the price and free shipping...So I only paid $14.99 for these earrings. When I received them I was taken by how pretty they were, but couldn't figure out if they were white stones or blue! The blue topaz in these earrings was so light that they looked almost like white stones. In that I was disappointed, but in everything else very pleased. A value at $14.99 but I would not have paid $29.99 for these earrings with the poor stone color. Problem is: you don't know until you get them!",3
98,"A bit disappointed by the quality - very small stones, and delicate chain. It looked more substantial in the advert. However, given its price reasonable value for money.
",3
100,"The ring I received is very nice, but it looks quite bit different from what is pictured. The ring on the picture looks carved on a polished background where the Celtic Knot is contiguous. The ring I received is laser etched with several independent Celtic Knots in groups of 4. So nice ring, but not as advertised.
",3
117,"I always wanted to buy a lock and key pendant necklace. Here I am expecting something else but it is not bad. It is cute but the chain did break after a week and I use my own. Would I recommend this, not really unless you are into small jewelry.
",3
124,"This is a cute little pendant from the front, but the backs of the key and lock aren't finished, so when they get turned around, which will ultimately happen since they're hanging on a chain, the not-so-pretty side will show. I'm satisfied with it for the price, though. I like the bale the charms hang from as it can be put on various sizes of chains. I plan to take the key and lock off and try them as earrings, too.
",3
129,"it's probably my fault, but this is a very small pendant. sized more for a child than an adult. the chain is also very thin. there are many other pendants to choose from in this price range and I wish I chose one of them.
",3
151,"Just OK, not fantastic. Despite the reviews, no, it would NOT fool anyone. It's simply a nice addition to add to a collection of fun jewelery pieces.
",3
176,"I bought this ring to wear to work during my pregnancy because my gold ring did not fit anymore. It worked great as a replacement and kept it's shine for months. Definitely worth it.
",3
177,"Wow, the stones on this ring really ARE tiny. Somehow you really just don't see the separation between the stones on this ring the way you do in the picture. However, for the price, can you really go wrong? It's still a very cute ring.
",3
192,"what can you expect? This ring did live up to it's price, I was just hoping to get more than I payed for. Lightweight, no sparkle, cloudy stones...it went back immediately.
",3
200,"I was excited to order this ring. I have developed an allergy to my white gold wedding set and needed something sterling silver to wear. The price is certainly right on this ring, but it isn't really convincing enough to pass as the real deal. I had decided to keep it since it was okay for the price, but I ordered the wrong size and sent it back anyway.
",3
206,"This ring is really cute. The stones are small, but they're set pretty well so they shine nicely. I doubt I'll lose a stone since they're set in so well. Also, the ring is really comfortable to wear. I own different eternity bands and sometimes they're itchy or uncomfortable, but that's not a problem with this one. For a cute, simple eternity band, I would recommend this one.
",3
208,"I bought two of the rings to be stack ring on each side of other rings. The height is good. I was disappointed that the CZ is not as noticable as they appear in the picture. But they do look nice with the other rings.
",3
240,"It's ok, not as sparkly as I thought it would be. I'm looking for a substitute wedding ring as my fingers have swelled up since I had a baby. It was a little uncomfortable if you squeeze your fingers together. I ended up returning this one. I think I will purchase a ring in person instead of online. Haven't had much luck so far.
",3
248,"In general I am pleased with my purchase. It is a ruby and it is 14kt gold however, the picture of the nose screw and what I actually got were not the same. The item I received had the (pigtail?) not the gentle curve of the nose screw pictured.
",3
249,"I purchased the ring just days before christmas and just in time too. With weeks of studying I was sure this would have been the best choice but I was ashamed to give the ring to my fiance because it was so poor of quality. Her father is a jewlery desiner and appraised the ring for me. I def. didnt like the feedback I got from him. I have rated this item a 3 because I should have known better then to order a Diamond ring online. Good luck to all!
",3
257,"It's nice enough, did not realize it would stick out so much. I wanted to where it with my wedding set but found that it looked better alone. I think if I stacked it with some other rings like it, it would be very pretty
",3
258,"this product looks amazing, but if you look closely you'll see that it's cracked and actually looks like it's been pieced back together...whats going on here?
",3
281,"In person this ring is pretty plain. There are no grooved areas on the sides as it looked to me. But the ring is cheap and I guess you get what ya pay for it. Don't get me wrong it is made well but just not what I thought it would be.
",3
291,"These earings are great for the price, but I was not expecting anything this clunky, and the picture does not convey how plastic looking and feeling the orange ""stones"" are- there's a ridge around the outside edge from what I assume is the mould. They're also fairly big earings, as long as my thumb. I wish Nvie would show pictures of their jewelery on models so the relative size was more apparent.On the other hand, once I took the section with the orange and black plastic pieces off, the little red bits wrapped in wire made very cute earings on their own!
",3
305,"toe ring is cute...but the picture is misleading...it looks like the toe ring is adjustable...but infact it is not...i tried to make it wider to fit onto my toe and it broke in half...so it a one size fits all...but the size is too small to get onto the toe...and if you have skinny toes to big to stay on the toe...
",3
346,"They would have gotten 5 stars except I have a dimple in one of my pearls.
",3
361,"I did not expect the cz to be too big, it is unbelievable for me to wear it everyday. It is so fancy looking that it could be worn as a fun ring for evening cocktails or parties. In my opinion, this ring is so pretentious...I'll give it to my mom who likes to wear fancy rings for fun and parties.
",3
370,"The ring was gorgeous just wish I could of exchanged it instead of having to return it. The setting was loose and the stone wasn't set correctly.
",3
387,"This ring can pass for white gold. The stone cleans up well and sparkles like a real diamond. The band is a bit thin but looks real. Has been worn doing dishes, showers etc. and no problems. Only complaint couple of the prongs go a bit sideways. You have to examine it closely to notice.
",3
407,"This is a pretty good design and it doesn't hang too far down. After a couple weeks though the dice did actually come loose and I had to superglue the dice back onto the bar. Other than that it is very pretty and I like the little sparkles on the dice.
",3
414,"The silver looks like costume jewelry. My wife says she loves it, that might just be because I finally broke down and bought her jewelry.
",3
417,"Looks nice, small gauge. Was a bit more difficult to insert than my original, due to tighter loop. I like the fact that the post is shorter, so less of it ""shows"" inside your nose. It has a snugger fit, stays in well.
",3
421,"I wish I had checked the shape of my old nose screw because this one didn't fit me. :( Supposedly this jewelry corresponds to a left nostril piercing, but that is certainly not my experience. All the ""left nostril"" nose screws shown by Body Candy look like this item, but my own personal nose screw - that actually fits in my left nostril - looks like the ones they advertise as ""right nostril"" nose screws. I am perplexed!Aside from that, it is good quality but DOES look much smaller than its stated gauge. I got a s.steel nosering from the same company and it doesn't look as small, so maybe it's because it's gold. Not sure which nose screw to choose now...
",3
440,"You get what you pay for. They don't make my ears turn green but the earring itself turns black.
",3
441,"As the first review said, they didn't make my ears turn green but the earring itself turned black. I wore them for about 6 months before the stones fell out on a few of them. I'm going to purchase them again though because they're a decent deal. I'd rather pay $15 every 6 months than have to shell out $90 on a single pair of white gold earrings (I have 3 holes in each ear).
",3
442,"Really pretty ring--beautiful color. Mine did arrive with a tiny chip on the corner of the stone....was pretty inexpensive though, so I don't think I'll bother sending it back. One con is that the two exposed points of the stone are rather sharp...you could really hurt yourself/someone is you accidentally scratched them. Overall I am quite pleased with my purchase--4 stars.EDIT: Two weeks later--have chipped off both pointy tips just wearing normally and given myself quite a nasty scratch as well. Still think it's really pretty, but maybe best for just occasional wear. Downgrading to 3 stars.

447,"item arrived damaged but company provided replacement efficiently and without any hassle. polite, prompt and efficient service. attractive bracelet. the silver beads on the bracelet are a little cheap looking but as they age and oxide they will look better....

480,"I don't like to reView things. It was okay but a little big for a phone charm
",3
482,"I like this necklace cord OK, but it is not as dark a brown as in the photo (where it looks almost black). instead it's a medium brown color. the difference in color gives it more of a casual, Western/cowboy type of look. also, the title of the item clearly states ""dark brown leather cord"" and I thought it was real leather until I just noticed the descriptive paragraph lists it as ""faux leather."" this is a difference in quality that should be addressed in the title.

487,"I love the symbol, but the chain is terrible so i just switched it with another chain so its good now i recommend only if you have a back up chain waiting to replace the one it comes with.

534,"The quality of the necklace is OK, but the words ""I AM DIABETIC"" need to be bigger. I am afraid in case of an emergency a First Responder might not see them.
",3
579,"I would have easily given this necklace 5 stars BUT I wore it once and the black silk cord that it's hanging on broke! Broke in a way that's not easily fixed. I do love it though and it's like no necklace I've ever seen before. I get lots of compliments on it. I'm going to purchase a new black cord so I can wear it again. It's not worth sending back just for another cord.
",3
590,"I would rate this a 5-star if they had entitled it carmel-colored jasper bracelt. However, if you're looking for green opal then you're going to be disappointed. The stones aren't green and I've never seen an opal look like this.
",3
607,"it was crooked so i tried to bend it cuz it's soft metal and the fingertip segment broke off on one side. it's fine it still stays attached mostly and still looks neat.
",3
631,"This is a very pretty ring.It has one flaw. The mesh can become slightly unraveled around the edges and get caught on cloth material.
",3
632,"I loved the look of the ring. It is very comfortable. The problem is that the mesh comes apart and there are sharp pieces that catch on everything. I dont know how this can be repaired. I would not buy it again.
",3
639,"This ring is sweet and bright. The stone is small, but it is nice for a child; however: the stone fell out of my daughter's ring, and I'm trying to replace it (not as easy as it looks.) I wonder if that stone falling out is a fluke, because the stone in my ring seems to be in very well. It is quite a pretty little ring.
",3
664,"It was just ""okay."" I sent it back, but only because I needed a special piece for a wedding. This would have fit the bill, if it weren't for the fact that it was jointed and wouldn't lay flat. Because it kept twisting and turning, you lost the look of it. Also the clasp was very small and hard to open. It took me about five minutes to get the necklace off by myself. In the end, I decided that it was a bit too ""chokery"" in length, and I needed something longer... maybe 18"" instead of 16"". So the search continues. But I have to say... if you are looking for a unique choker, this is a nice and unique piece of jewelry. The stones were nice, the purple was as pictured on-line... not pale like a lot of the amethysts you get on the net. And the silver was pretty... nice and shiny, obviously sterling. It's a good value, if that style is what you're after.

700,"It seemed to look alot more brillant in the photo, the gold is somewhat dullbut it is still pretty

",3
767,"Received this figaro chain quickly but it wasn't as described in sellers listing. Stated it had a lobster clasp, which was important to me. Came with a spring clasp. Passed over several other less expensive chains for that reason. Although the chain is nice; it's a dissapointment to me.
",3
822,"This charm is just OK. I like that it's finished on all sides. But I've seen prettier bicycle charms elsewhere. I haven't put it on my charm bracelet yet because I don't like it well enough. I may give it along with a charm bracelet, to my 4 year old neighbor when she learns to ride her new bike.

",3
847,"This cute, although the ballet shoes are extremely small and hard to see the detail, the chain is thin, then it is fine to be used by a girl, it's just an ornament for the moment.
",3
866,"The two middle slots are narrower than the two outside slots which I don't care for. Remotes can be bulky. And though mine all fit in the slots, I have to put the bigger controls on the outside ones. It would have been nicer to make all the slots equal in size and a little larger.
",3
869,"I felt that the description of this item was sadly misunderstood. The necklace itself is very pretty, but it look very fragile, its width is small, and the necklace is shiny. I enjoyed it as a female necklace, but hte purchase was for my boyfriend... it doesn't look masculene..it looks feminine.

It definitely should have come packaged like necklaces usually do with some sort of backing/stand so that it wouldn't tangle during shipment.Also, it has a very cheap chain. It's what you would expect for the price I paid, but I did expect better from the Amazon Curated Collection.

I wanted small and dainty (about a dime size in length) and this ended up being about a nickel size in length. Still a nice look and I can wear alone or as a layering chain.

1158,"I purchased this product earlier this year. Initially, I was pleased with the craftmanship and overall product.About the third wearing, I noticed the lapis had become uneven (one side had sunk deeper into the setting) leaving the surrounding metal pertruding around nothing. By the end of the day the entire stone had settled deeper into the mount resulting in a ridge of metal above the now-disappearing stone.At first, I thought maybe I had bumped the stone and loosened it. Looking back, I am certain that wasn't the case. To correct the problem, I took the ring to a silversmith who evenly pushed the metal ridge down, around the stone. The appearance isn't the same.For a ring this size, and a stone this large, it is an almost weightless piece of jewelry. My other sterling pieces are much heavier than this piece. Reminds me of a tin ring I used to get from a penny machine at the bus station.
",3
1189,"these earrings are exactly as described. very pretty, long enough to be eye catching, obviously the diamonds are too small to make a big statement so not to wear to the oscars. excellent value for money. and at this price if you loose your little diamonds you wont be too upset! Packing very poor so if its a gift, find something more chci to present them in.

1210,"I admit it I knew better. Just because all the multi-millionaires playing baseball wear these certainly doesn't prove they have any medicinal value. However if you want to wear one to look cool this is a pretty good price. For us bigger folks this one comes larger than most.

I'm an international buyer so it's a bit expensive to return this item, however, I donated the 22"" one to a local charity sale. Since I can't wear this necklace myself I'm not sure if it works well, so this 3-star rating is given to the seller, for shipping a wrong item.

1256,"THIS NECKLACE GIVES ME POWER!!! No seriously it's just a blue necklace that I only bought because Josh Beckett wears them. GO SOX!
",3
1272,"I am not sure what I was expecting from this product...but pain relief from the short amount of time I've worn it has been unnoticed.
",3
1282,"The necklace was 16&#34; not 18&#34; but it fit (barely) so I kept it. I had an old one that I lost a while ago and once again I feel better when working out and seem to feel better between workouts....I just wish it was a bit longer.
",3
1287,"In my opinion, this product doesn't work as advertised, but it looks good, so I really can't complain. I bought mine knowing that it most likely wasn't going to work, but I figured that if it did, it would be nice. It is simple looking, and can be tucked under any shirt. I wear mine everyday, and I have noticed no change. I would recommend this for someone who wants to try something new.
",3
1295,"It is 45 CM (17.7 inches), counting the clasp. Actual length when around your neck hovers at 17 inches.If that helps you with determining what size is for you, then I am glad to be of some help.Made out of comfortable material and I see no structural weaknesses.I didn't buy it for whatever hocus pocus it is trying to sell itself on, I just liked the style.
",3
1296,"I thought this product was going to make a visible and evident difference in my performance (I play tennis). It did nothing for me.
",3
1300,"The product seems to be fine... I do notice a slight decrease in soreness while wearing this product. The only complaint I have as of right now is that the necklace is a bit stiff and wont lie flat around my neck. Tends to try and keep its oval shape. This may wear off in time. Great delivery time also.
",3
1325,"Nice necklace but the chain is thin and it isn't as substantial as the picture shows. Pretty gems and nice color.
",3
1330,"I was disappointed in the ring. It looked so nice on the internet that is why I thought I had to have it, I thought it was very elegant and the width of the band was just what I was looking for. But two days after I received it two stones fell out. However I emailed the company right away and they are replacing it for me, I will be mailing it 8-17-07. I only hope that the replacement will last me a longer time that I can enjoy it. I am giving three stars because the Customer Service that I received was very good.Sept 4, 2007. I got my replacement ring in the mail, it was beautiful. However 2 days after I had it two stones feel out of it again. It is not like I was digging in a garden while wearing it. I am very dissapointed with the product. The ring is very beautiful when you first get it, but the way the stones are placed in it make it not even worth buying.
",3
1331,"Its nice but not as high quality as I thought it would be. Packaging was very nice.
",3
1333,"I bought this ring with the intention of stacking it with a fake engagement ring found also on gem avenue. However, with a solitaire ring, it didn't really look good stacked. The ring is also a little bigger than my other size 10 rings. Anyways, I wear it as a thumb ring and it looks good there.
",3
1334,"So far so good, it was only shiney and sparkled at first. Once you start wearing it it dulls, I've been worrying about stones falling out but so far so good. It will probably happen after I push the send button.
",3
1339,"All the stones are very loose. I'm certain one of these days I'm going to loose one. A little uncomfortable at first, if there was one lest stone, it wouldn't hit the fingers around it.
",3
1341,"Definitevily need to buy 3 rings and wear them together, could be different stones or all 3 of the same, otherwise looks ""bare"". I wish the stones were a darker green. Worth it if it is on sale.
",3
1356,"I ordered this bracelet, but instead of bracelet received bunch of paper cover books!I got the return label by e-mail, and returned next day. Still did not get a refund. Same with earrings. I only received the necklace
",3
1379,"I know if you're buying Cubic Zirconium, you really shouldn't expect too much, but I've seen some beautiful ones, so I was hopeful with this. The CZ ""stone"" in the middle is foggy, almost. You can only tell if you're looking closely, but it's still there. Looks like a real diamond from far away.It's about the size of your pinkie fingernail - not too big, but it catches the light and sparkles everywhere.I'd definitely buy another one of these if it weren't for the foggy quality of the stone.
",3
1387,"Got this for my daughters and after a few weeks of constant winding the key would crank and then spin out quickly. I carefully dismantled the jewelery box to look into it and found that the plastic gearbox case had split wide open making it unfixable.
",3
1388,"When I received and opened this jewelry box...it did NOT look like the picture shown...it does NOT have a ""heart"" shaped mirror inside, very misleading. But I had no time to return it, as it was a gift and I had to get it wrapped & given quickly.
",3
1390,"Very pretty but not durable. I bought this for my neice and it is very cute. However, when I got it I took it out of the box and put it back in. The next time I took it out, some of the top of the jewelry box got scratched off. So I'd still suggest this item but once you take it out of the box don't put it back in.
",3
1403,"The back of the box broke and needed to be glued. This was a gift for a 6 year old and while it probably was open more freqently than an adult product it should not have borken the first day. Very disappointed in my gift purchases this year. Not sure I direct mail a product without first checking it personally.
",3
1410,"This jewelry box is very cute... like I had growing up. BUT, the ballerina on ours has quit spinning when tbe box is opened after only 5 months. It continues to spin when the box is closed and then needs to be rewound with each opening. My daughter has been VERY careful with it, so I dont think it's from rough usage. But, she still enjoys it and uses it!
",3
1428,"I actually bought this item thinking that the Peridots were real. (Not having any experience with Peridots.) When my wife asked about them, saying that they looked too clear to be natural, I looked at the ad again. ""Gem type: Peridot"" suggests natural or lab created, but ""Creation Method: Simulated,"" I think, means that there are no gems, only gem colored crystals. Other ads state ""Peridot Colored Crystal,"" which is much more clear. Given my wife's preference, I'd have ruled out natural gems and lab created gems as too expensive or unacceptable in quality before buying this item.The crystals are very pretty; I would have preferred that the fact that the Peridot colored beads were just that be more clear.
",3
1442,"First, let me say, this is a classy-looking necklace! But the peridot is a lot less intensely green than the picture makes it look unless it's against the right color background. It also won't hang quite like the picture shows--I swear that the angle of the part that the zirconium is mounted on is less steep, and you're also definitely going to get a really obvious bend where the chain meets that part.More importantly, though, I hadn't even worn the necklace for more than a few minutes (to try it on when it arrived), but a few months later when I took it out of the box again the chain was tarnished in several places. It was very disappointing because I expected better quality for something that cost this much. I'm a college student = not a lot of spending money, so it was really hard for me to justify splurging like this (but I have a huge weakness for pretty jewelry, so I did it just this once). Unfortunately, the tarnishing means I probably won't do so again, or at least I will be very hesitant about buying from from Peora the next time I find myself in possession of extra cash.
",3
1443,"Really cute, good quality. My only problem is that the upside down belly ring doesn't hang correctly it kind of droops because the bottom is so heavy.
",3
1450,"This is a beautiful ring, and I really liked it. Only problem is the stone fell out, and I chucked it int the woods oooopsie! Besides from that little mishap, very nice looking and exquisite design.
",3
1462,"This is made out of pretty cheap pot metal and mine just snapped in half recently. Ordering a new one. Being $12 I can't really complain.
",3
1470,"Well,the watch did not work because it had no batery.I had to buy the batery by myself.
",3
1496,"Its a beautiful anklet, but I really thought it would be bigger.
",3
1498,"The anklet is pretty, has a nice thickness, and it fits well. And it seems like it's generally of good quality. However, the item I received was kinked in two places when I removed it from the box. I may have simply received a damaged item, but beware that this may happen to you as well.
",3
1506,"This necklace was o.k. but as seen in the picture, the clear nylon thread that holds it together never really straightens out. It is very delicate and lightweight.
",3
1533,"This is a very nice necklace. My only problem is with the ""LOBSTER CLAW"" clasp. The thing fell apart. After much effort I was able to get it put back together and had to apply pressure with pliers on the sides of the clasp so the parts would stay put and work.
",3
1539,"The pendant is nice but the chain isn't very durable. I will wear the pendant with another chain to decrease the chance of breakage and loss.
",3
1544,"First of all, this was a gold box special, but I was charged full-price. Secondly, the chain came with distinct kinks in it. I have gotten most of them out, but a few remain. These little &quot;knots&quot; cause the chain to look like less expensive costume jewelry. Admittedly, $50 is not a high price, but the chain doesn't even look that good. I also can't get customer service to respond to the wrong pricing. Maybe by the time you read this, I will have received an answer though.
",3
1558,"It's plastic, but does the trick. The biggest problem the plastic chain is way to short. I can barley get it around my neck. I would try something with a longer chain.
",3
1573,"The chain is lovely but I ordered 16"" and got 15 1/4"".Both chains I ordered, 16"" and 18"" were about 3/4 to 1"" shorter.That seems deceptive to me. You should get what you paid for!Won't buy jewelry from here again.
",3
1579,"This is a pretty little chain, and it's surprisingly sturdy for the price.Unfortunately the gaps between the links are just wide enough to trap hair at the nape of your neck, and if you're not careful, you'll end up with giant wads of torn-out hair stuck in the chain.
",3
1586,"This is a very well made chain and it is well weighted. However, it has no shine to it whatsoever!! It looks very grey like gloomy storm clouds. It doesn't even look like white gold it is so dull. Looks more like stainless steel in overall appearance/color. I sent mine back!
",3
1610,"I thought this was all right.I was disappointed that I can't wear it much because the clasp is inferior and tears my hair.
",3
1626,"Amazon product description talks about diamond certification but the fine print says that no certificate will be provided. I ordered this item and NO certificate was provided.Also, Amazon charges 15% restocking fee for jewelry returns. And all returns need to be insured. So, return becomes super expensive. THINK before you buy jewelry from Amazon.com. You are probably better off buying from a local store.
",3
1627,"Over all a good purchase. I got these for my wife she likes them. When I seen them I was not very impress with the looks they are bigger then I thought they would from looking at the image. But that's the chance you take when ordering item online. Next time I will just find items that has a few customer reviews.
",3
1631,"The earrings are very pretty. My only negative comment is that the backings that hold on the earrings are entirely too small. We will have to replace them with larger backings. It is ashame to buy a product; then to have to go back to a jewlery store to to replace parts that are inferior.
",3
1669,"This item is nice, but it should have a ruler in the item picture. I was surprised at how small 4.6 MM and 16 grams is. --- UPDATE! I found out after writing this review that the wrong and much smaller 1 MM item was sent to me. I returned it.
",3
1670,"I first thought that this necklace would be a little longer when i first looked at it. I was to hasty ordering it cause my birthday was just around the corner (Jan.5), and I guess it was despratation. Next time I will have to pay more attention to what I order, but i still like it though.
",3
1702,"I don't actually know how well these are going to hold up. They were a gift. However, when I got them1) they just came in a bag. No earrings backing, which I found strange.2) The color is more green than the picture. I was expecting a nice, calm blue. No. More of a bright blue with specks of green and yellow.However, they were very pretty nonetheless. Just realize the picture wasn't exactly what we got.
",3
1744,"I have a hard time believing that these pearls are AA quality. They are of a very nice size, but every single pearl has significant visible flaws. And the luster is not that amazing. Well, when you wear them, they still look nice, but I believe I could get a better product for the price. Previously I purchased pearls from the Amazon collection that were described as A quality. They are nearly perfect, and the luster is fantastic. I payed for them significantly less than these pearls that I am reviewing. I was torn between keeping or returning them for a while, but I will be traveling for a long time, so it looks like I am stuck with them.

1786,"I ordered this bracelet because in the picture it looked mostly purple. Well, the stones definitely had a purple AND green hue to them. I do not wear green or particularly like that color, so I sent the bracelet back. This doesn't mean that there was anything wrong with the bracelet, just a matter of personal preference. The stones were a pretty decent size and the bracelet looked OK.
",3
1791,"this bracelet is beautiful, however, i thought it would be a little more sturdy since it is sterling silver, it seems a little flimsy.
",3
1798,"i bought this as a gift for my mom, have not given it to her yet, but it is not what i expected, the piece just does not look as classy as what was shown on product page. It looks a bit dull. But was hoping for a bit more...clasps are a bit annoying to do up as well, you're definitely gonna need some help there. I bought it to match a pendant that i got her and it does do that.
",3
1813,"From the picture on the web, these seem to be dangle earrings with great colors and transparency. But it wasn't until I got them that I realized that the stones are drab and quite opaque, connected through a rigid post in the back with no chance of dangling. And they are quite heavy too.

",3
1840,"These earrings are definitely pretty, but I agree with the other reviewers who said they were bigger than they expected. I bought them as a gift for my mother but ended up returning them, because they didn't look good on me so I knew they probably wouldn't look good on her. That's not to say they're not nice, I just expected something a little daintier.
",3
1846,"These were very attractive on web, and pretty when I received. Nice gift bag and box. Only concern was the ear loops were bent making them appear less than &quot;sterling.&quot; But I will wear them once adjusted.
",3
1857,"This bracelet is absolutely gorgeous. I was going to a wedding, and I wanted to wear black jewelry, so I purchased this bracelet. It went perfectly with my dress and my other jewelry.The only problem I had with it was that the clasp did not want to stay closed. Several times throughout the evening, the bracelet fell off. Fortunately, I found it every time, but next time I may not be so lucky.
",3
1877,"Unlike the matching bracelet I previously ordered from Amazon.com, this necklace was acceptable in that the Mother-of-Pearl inlay did not have a gross defect in its surface. Value for the dollar spent, but no bargain by any means.
",3
1881,"Beautiful ring, but mine broke two weeks after I got it. The band is somewhat flimsy so be careful with it.
",3
1887,"Cute but not loud enough. I love bells and finally found this bracelet, but was disappointed with the soft sound.

1902,"LOVE THESE EARRINGS- GOT FOUR PAIR-- WANT MORE!!!! THESE WERE A GIFT--LIKE OTHER COLORS- CASUAL/ GREAT PRICE.
",3
1904,"I wanted to give this as gift to someone, but I didn't because I was disappointed when I received it.As someone mentioned, the jewel is very small. I know the actual size is mentioned in the description, but when I ordered it, I didn't understand it actually. It was the size of a finger nail.Another reason I didn't like it was it didn't look as good as the photo. It just didn't. Also the jewelry part doesn't really settle down properly when it is put on the neck;the pendent just sticks out.What I liked about it?-The chain. It was very sturdy. I think I can still use it for something.-The tiny box. I love the purple box that it came with.-The jewel. I love how that green jewel is put properly on the piece. I don't think it would come out randomly.
",3
1905,"Nice pendant, which arrived with lightning speed! Only drawback is that the bale prevents the pendant from lying flat against the chest, instead, it rocks back & forth. I would have rated this item as four stars, if it were not for that one flaw. The cut & color of the peridot are of decent quality & the sterling silver setting is a very nice, different design.
",3
1911,"I was looking for a good looking jewelry roll to take with me to jewelry shows and the picture of this one looked pretty good. When I received it, I was very disappointed. It's cheap looking and the space where you insert ID is not even big enough for a standard business card. I really don't think this is worth $20, maybe $10. I'm thinking I could find something at the flea market for less money and have it be better looking. It might work for personal use for trips but if you want to look professional, look elsewhere.
",3
1932,"I saw this belly button ring and had to have it... When i got it i had it on for less then 5mins when it started to cut into me. The edges of the rose are very sharp and cut into my belly while sitting. this might do wonders for posture but i'd rather try another way. It hurt so bad i had to stop wearing it....SO cute but VERY painful
",3
1935,"I would aslo tell them it has a spring clasp. It has some weight to it, so you know you have it on,but not heavy.I love it and sterling silver it becoming a favorite.
",3
1938,"This necklace is beautiful, but the chain is cheaply made and unfortunately it is not interchangable. it is also much smaller than it appears in the picture, but I didn't check the measurements before purchase.
",3
2568,"great price- can't beat that. keep in mind - these have more blue and less green in the stones. that was not obvious from the picture so they did not match my bracelet. otherwise- very nice
",3
2582,"DON'T LIKE THE COLOR OF STONES. i THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE MORE THE COLOR OF NECKLACE, BUT GUESS THEY ARE FROM TWO DIFFERENT COMPANIES. THE WIRE IS NOT THIN SO DOESN'T LOOK AS DAINTY AS SHOULD.WANT TO SEND THEM BACK, TOO.

2607,"Didn't find the earrings to be of the quality I expected from the photo. Not bad, but not great.

2630,"cute but disappointed stone fell out. Hard to say a lot about the product they look good but when the stone fell out you can't fix it, or do you want to pay to have the stone replaced return it after it is worn.
",3
2651,"Very pretty and all but quite large pendants. If you have a small family it is great but if you are a family of 10 like ours it is too large for one necklace.
",3
2655,"These hoops are really gorgeous, but get opaque very easily while handling. The hook needs a bit of adjusting so they close properly too. They look very nice though, I guess you just need to clean them often!
",3
2668,"The chain is garbage. Broke within seconds after opening the box. Pendant is perfect. Small but all jewelry is smaller than you think it will be. :PStones are a tiny bit lighter than I wanted but She loved them as is, so thats not an issue that matters.I recommend the item for a man that wants something very nice but also a little different form the usual fair.Also, it doesn't break the bank. :)Would have been 4 to 5 stars if the chain had not been so substandard.
",3
2676,"Very pretty and all but quite large pendants. If you have a small family it is great but if you are a family of 10 like ours it is too large for one necklace.
",3
2679,"I won't dispute the other reviewers' comments about this bracelet being attractive. It is very nice looking. The one thing I was shocked about was how light this is. At first I thought this was rose colored plastic. Granted, it is stamped 14k and ITALY and everything is soldered, but the weight seriously made me question. They must be rolling these sheets out paper thin in order to make the links. So if you're looking for a bracelet with some weight, best keep looking.
",3
2680,"The medallion is ok, not great. I am afraid the chain will tarnish on my son's neck. Not really worth the $19.95.
",3
2681,"This ring looks very pretty and cute in the photo. However this ring has some flaws... 1) ring is very tiny and thin (more than looks in photo), 2) ring is not a true size 6 (so if buy probably should get 1 size up) and 3) Red enamel is a lil sloppy in person (Idk if every copy of ring is like one I got but mine the red did not stay inside the heart. it bleed over to heart edge n side on some hearts). The positives... 1) it's silver, 2)pretty shade of red and 3) If you like hearts this ring is 4 u. So if one is gonna buy just be aware that the ring is very delicate and fragile so you will have to be very careful with it and take very good care of it and want to buy one size up if your fingers are not a small/barely size 6 or big size 5. On a side note I would rate the seller Eve's Addiction MUCH higher than the ring. I give the ring a 3 out of 5 stars and EA 4.8 out of 5 stars.
",3
2717,"I purchased these for my wife and immediately up on receiving them ran to the local jeweler and replaced them. They're certainly fine for what they are ... nice quality, inexpensive, and large, no humongous, nope - make that huge honking earrings. They're probably best suited to people with a genetic predisposition towards spectacularly sized heads and ears.The three stars are for quaility and value, not asthetics.
",3
2719,"I purchased these to go with another pair of earrings. Little did I realize that the other reviewers were NOT exagerating. These suckers are huge and you do need the right type of face to be able to pull off wearing them.I really like them and I am sure they will go with a lot of stuff but I don't think I would purchase anything similar.Yes, the earrings are just that big.WOW!!
",3
2720,"Please be sure and pay attention to the scale image and the other reviewers comments as these earrings are huge - larger than my earlobes. If you want bling, but these. If you want subtle everyday earrings, look elsewhere.
",3
2723,"i was on the search for big and tacky earrings... and i found them!! they are HUGE. i find the sterling silver to be a bit soft so the posts bend easily. dont think i've ever had sterling silver earrings before so i dont know if they are supposed to or not. but if your not looking for big and tacky these arent for you. the stone itself is bigger than my ear lobe. because they are bigger than i was expecting i dont wear them often. so i think the amount i paid was a little too much considering the amount of wear i will get out of them.
",3
2727,"These earrings are knock-your-eyes-out large! They are pretty but don't seem to sit right on my ears. I like them anyway. The lime quartz is pale and sparkly. Think they would be good for someone not as petite as I am. They stand out from the ear like a little box in their setting. I paid $19.00 for them awhile ago and feel they would be good for the right person.They look smaller in the picture.
",3
2734,"they are very small and cute,I was really excited about these,I know that I can only wear surgical stainless earrings, but I thought that I would like to test platinum, as it turns out, they make my ears itch.they are a little hard to get on and off, plan on having a friend help you as these are very solid earrings.
",3
2735,"The pendant is pretty, and it was inexpensive as far as jewelry goes, but when the product finally came, I was a little disappointed. The stone is skewed in the setting since the right post is thicker than the left. It's not significantly noticeable when viewed from the front though, so I didn't mind. Also, browse Netaya's website before buying through Amazon. I found a 10k version of the same pendant on sale for less. So if carats don't matter, you might find the better deal elsewhere.
",3
2745,"Overall item is absolutely beautiful, but the message parts of the bracelet are not put together with solid rings. Have already had a problem with these rings. Otherwise very pleased.
",3
2757,"Not too sure about this product. It will turn your finger green, but nothing that a little clear finger nail polish can't take care of. Looks different online. I thought about sending it back but the husband likes it.
",3
2760,"I was very pleased with this ring when I first got it in December. Within a couple of weeks it was turning my finger green. I have only had it for a few months and it has become tarnished very quickly despite the fact that I clean it. It is a very beautiful ring so I am a little sad that it is not the quality I was looking for.
",3
2764,"My husband bought me this ring and it was so very lovely when it arrived. I wore it for a couple of months and received many compliments. Since I rotate my jewelry, this was not a daily wear item. That is why I was so disappointed when it started looking dull and the ""silver"" started to wear off. Even a light buff with a shine cloth did nothing for it, and I was afraid to use a cleaner since the color was already coming off. It was beautiful to start with, but it did not last long. If I had to guess, I had worn it maybe 15 to 20 times. I expect even my costume jewelry to last longer than that.
",3
2782,"This is a pretty pin, but it is much, much smaller than it looks in the picture.
",3
2797,"They were definitely beautiful as previous reviews stated. The problem is that I must have odd fingers as they were so big they made my middle and pinky fingers stick way out to the side. It was far from comfortable and would have looked awkward to someone else's eyes. I am sending them back. Other than the too-bulky-for-me problem, the 2 day shipping was fast. The rings do not look cheap at all, but be prepared (in case you are like me) to have the prongs poking you. I even tried just one or two of the rings and it did not look right.
",3
2806,"Purchased these for my wedding ring to wear on opposite sides. I got a lot of compliments on them and they did look amazing for about one months before they started to loose their lustedr and sparkle.. two months later all the silver has been rubbed off and I don't even wear my wedding rings all day. Good for show but don't last long.
",3
2845,"I bought this ring because i always wanted to add an anniversary ring to my wedding ring... these rings look so fake next to my wedding ring... if u are buying it to wear next to high quality jewelry ...do not buy.. but if you plan on wearing it by it's self... BUY IT...
",3
2859,"Although these are suppose to be stackable, they do not line up well and contains 2 smaller bands - in ring size and CZ size. The prongs on the bands are very uncomfortable and sharp and will take some getting used to. Other than the size issues I would not have returned them if the rings and CZ were all the same size.
",3
2861,"The rings are pretty but they are very uncomfortable. I only wore one at a time and couldn't get used to it. I am normally a 4.5 so maybe they were just too big. I sent them back for a refund.
",3
2862,"The rings are very cute. I personally do not think they look real, but then again you get what you pay for. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but the CZ stones very easily come off. The first day I wore them, I lost 2 stones on each ring. That was disappointing.

2894,"I was really excited to receive these rings. I really wanted to love them but I have to agree with the poster who said there is just something about them that makes them look fake and ""Made in China"" as stamped on the inside. I can't pinpoint it exactly either. This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. By looking at the metal, there is no way these would hold up to daily wear as wedding/anniversary bands. It almost looks like tin foil and I can tell if would start flaking. I am sure though the designer didn't necessarily intend these to be worn as every day rings.Would be fun wear to a party or on the right hand but I put 2 of these on either side of my wedding band and engagement ring and it was laughable how fake they looked next to the real deal. My setting is in platinum so that might not help but even if someone has white gold, these are not going to match.As far as costume jewelry or something sparkly to wear on the right hand, these are cute little rings. In that regard they should get a 5 star.
",3
2909,"When I received this ring the first thing I noticed was the stones are all different sizes. For each individual band, the stones match, but the three rings themselves don't match. Also one band is slightly bent and doesn't sit flat against the others. But the stones have lots of sparkle and I had planned on using two of them for either side of my gold wedding band, which they work perfectly for. All in all, for the price, its a good value.
",3
2961,"Shipped quickly, nice product, but only 2 pieces of the 3 &#34;lock&#34; together. The last ring merely just spins around unlike the other 2. Maybe one of them was shipped wrong?
",3
2963,"I bought this ring(s) hoping to love it, but it was *okay*. Maybe because I do own real diamonds, my eye is a bit to keen. I felt like it looked fake. The silver also seems to bright, which may have been what made it look fake the most. It wasn't SUPER bad, which is why I gave it 3 stars. If you're wearing for fun, then you should be happy. But, if you're wearing it to pass it off as the real thing or to try to impress someone--don't bother!
",3
2974,"The rings are nice, but they are not that sparkly.... But other then that they were not too bad for the price....

3013,"This pendant was a very nice piece and the pendant itself had a lot of weight to it for sterling silver. Loved the extension chain very much as it was a nice little added feature but thought the pendant was much larger than I expected it to be. I had wanted something to wear as casual but it is something to wear on special occasions. No dimensions or size of the pendant were mentioned in the description so it was hard to tell. I will keep it though because it is a very nice pendant.
",3
3030,"I purchased this ring for my wife recently. It arrived quickly in the mail and naturally like any piece of jewelry, made my wife smile with joy.The ring is a relatively nice piece of costume jewelry and looked good on her hand. However; within less than a week, one of the small crystals fell out of the setting. This did not totally distract from it's shinny new beauty, but was a tale tell sign of shoddy workmanship. Based upon this, I personally feel this ring should be ""just a bit"" cheaper for the next buyer.
",3
3039,"The sizing of this ring ran a bit small. I actually had to send back and reorder a larger size. This could be because the ring is rather wide. It is nicely made and has held up for over a year of near constant wear. Be aware that the space between the links is a dark and the overall look is rough, not a smooth link. This is more of a ""tough"" style than a polished finish look.
",3
3040,"When I bought this ring I thought it was actually going to be a chain like my last ring of this style but instead it is just a hardened ring with design of a chian and not really a loose chain.
",3
3045,"the stem/bar is waaaay too long to actually fit in my bellybutton. it's a gorgeous stone though. it's also GIGANTIC.
",3
3048,"The style of these earrings are nice. The color is not so much the color you see on the page, however. It is more baby pink or gumball pink which is okay. The silver however leaves markings on your ears. Cheap silver, I suppose. Other than that -they are are nice earrings.Pros:Stylecolor (even if it is different than shown -they are s sweet color)sizeCons:cheap silver leaves tarnish marks on earlobe
",3
3066,"I bought this pretty ring thinking it could be sized and not knowing what ring size my friend is... (it did say in some of the specs--which were quite lengthy--that it could not be sized but I didn't realize that until later). The ring (size 9) was too big to fit me or my friend and I contacted Peora's customer service to send it back or exchange it...after 1 email they stopped communicating and I'm stuck with it. I've tried to reach them several times but they just ignore me--I buy quite a bit of jewelry and while theirs is pretty, I'll never buy there again! Simply not worth the hassle.
",3
3073,"I bought this during an Amazon jewelry sale for under $25. The 18"" length is great so it sits nicely when wearing. I give this 3 stars because the pendant itself is very small, similar circumference to a dime. I was anticipating larger. The diamond/sapphire idea is nice, but the stones are so small and squished together that is sort of looks like a wreath. The gold chain is exactly as appears in picture, very average. The stone setting is tight, I'd be amazed if a ""chip"" ever fell out. It does sparkle a little bit. Not a bad buy for a small pendant that's on super sale. The back is a solid gold circle that says ""China"" on it. If it wasn't so small, it could be a really great piece of jewelry.
",3
3082,"I and my wife (I bought this for her) liked this product. But she thought the earring is somewhat smaller.
",3
3084,"This is a really pretty set, the reds are deep, yet bright. Is very small, so kind of hard to see when wearing. But it works, and since I bought on discount, all the more better.
",3
3085,"It is very small. It good for kids maybe. The earrings are very very tiny, the necklace is a littler bigger.
",3
3126,"The color is a little darker than it appears in the photo, it is less of a sky blue an more of a dark blue. The light ball however is lighter and more gray than the bottom ball while the bar is another shade of blue. Under a UV light, the color is uniform and the ring is comfortable.
",3
3127,"Anybody familiar with the desert will recognize the road runner in this pendant. I don't know why the description calls it a phoenix. Perhaps the person got confused because they got it from Phoenix, Arizona?

3131,"The small one looks good but the medium, and especially the large look so cheap! Haven't worn them for that reason. I wish I didn't get them.
",3
3132,"I have a really flat belly button, so when I put this belly ring in, it stuck out REALLY far...so far that I had to take it out. It doesn't look right, but I'm sure if you have more skin to hide the bar it will look cute.

3166,"I originally bought the charm for myself because I whale watch often and a friend adopted a female whale for me named 'Eden.' I am gently obsessed with doingwhat I can to ensure the survival of the whales - especially Humpbacks. I did love the way the baby whale was suspended from its Mother on the charm,but it was more appropriate for my 5 year old Granddaughter to wear. She also loves whales and her Mother 'adopted' a female for her as well, who also has a baby calf! I would have been willing to spend more money for a larger charm, but you tried very hard to create life like detail, and I was very impressed with your service. SOMEWHERE on the internet there is a LARGE Humpback whale medallion, shown with 2 others, and I have been unable to find it again. Can you help me???

3198,"I thought this thing would just BLING out of the box but it did not. I asked my wife what she thought of it and she just said it was good. That means to me it's not the cats meow. It is very small and again doesn't really sparkle.

",3
3282,"I love these earrings, they are gorgeous and just the right size for a drop earring. The problem is they do not come with any type of security backing so mine fell out the first day I wore them. Fortunately enough for me, I was sitting right by where they fell and didn't loose them out somewhere. I would only recommend these earrings if they sell them with security post backs.
",3
3283,"I got these for my mother in law for Christmas. They are pretty, although not my style. The rubies are little tiny chips and they have ""made in china"" stamped on the back, whch drives me crazy. So, they are okay. A good weight, pretty earrings, but they say made in china.
",3
3314,"The stone in these earrings was very very very pale blue, almost looked like a diamond. And they are very small. I was surprised at how small they are but that is my fault for not reading the dimensions. On the plus side, they are solid and feel like good quality. The hinged loop is easy to use. I only wish the stone was darker but other than that I liked the earrings.
",3
3316,"From other reviews,I was expecting the stones on this to be lighter than the picture. However, the stones are almost colorless, barely a hint of the stone color. Otherwise, the earrings are very nice, fasten well and are sturdy.
",3
3323,"I fell in love with this ring when I found it, and gave my husband a lot of hints about it this time last year. Fortunately he got the hint and I started wearing it Christmas Day. I wore it so often though that it started rubbing wrong on my finger, and after a few months I noticed discoloration on the band and on my finger. On top of that, I noticed that the little stones were falling out. Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful ring, and I wore it all the time, but for having it less than I year it should not have worn out so quickly.Consider reading other reviews on this product before you buy it.
",3
3324,"For the price of this ring, I think it is low quality. Several of the stones have fallen out. :-( I would not recommend it.
",3
3334,"The photos here almost don't do the ring justice - it is truly very pretty and eye-catching. I don't think I've ever gotten so many compliments on such an inexpensive piece of jewelry. However, as others have said here, within weeks, the stones started falling out. I got the ring two years ago. Within a year and a half, the ring had lost so many stones that it was unwearable. Granted, I only paid $39.00 for it, and I really wore it often; so I suppose I got my money's worth. I gave it three stars because it was so pretty for a short time. I got what I paid for it. If I wanted something to last for years, I should have looked for something more expensive.
",3
3337,"I loved this ring when I bought it but was so bummed out because it didn't fit!! Since the ring is so large (it takes up your finger up to the knuckle), you need to buy this ring one size up. So I returned it and got the next size up. So happy thay I did!! I've also received many compliments!! It's also perfect for a right hanbd ring!!

3348,"Turns my finger green after 1/2 day. Feels smaller in size than listed...probably due to how tall it is. I would wear it more often if it weren't messy afterward

3351,"Its a FINE accessory... a great add-on to an all black or silver outfit... but my first ring had zirconias falling off, and tiny as it is, a missing stone doesn't look that great... i got a new one, but there is still that fear that stones might start coming off when i use it.overall, it looks great, a good accessory... but if you're looking for a more long-term, worry-free ring... that you won't have to check every so often if stones are missing... this is not for you.

3389,"The chain is great and its 17in, much better for some of us than a 16 in. the star is quite small, I would have liked a bigger one. It came in a nice gift box which surprised me. I would reccomend it to anyone with teenagers as a gift for them.
",3
3406,"I bought this for a Christmas gift and they have not received it yet. The quality of the box seems to be pretty sturdy and it was pretty. The only problem I had with it is the little fairy that spins isn't real girly looking.
",3
3410,"My daughter really likes the box. It's pretty and seems to be made of reasonably durable cardboard, for the price. My quibble is with the drawers. The side drawers are really small; none of my 3 year old's age-appropriate jewelry fits in them. Bigger issue is that the drawers fall out really easily (there's no catch to keep them from sliding totally out), and she can't get them back in herself. Bottom line, I kind of wish I had purchased the more basic box. But, it is pretty, and she also loves the music.
",3
3417,"The jewelry box is smaller than I thought it would be and the construction is not that great. The drawer stops are glued in with weak adhesive so if you pull the drawer at an angle, it comes right off. The graphics on it are very cute, though and the music is nice. Probably best for a 6-10 year old.
",3
3419,"I bought this for my granddaughter for part of her Christmas gift. She loves playing the music. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the jewelry box for the price. My daughter had thought of purchasing it for two of her nieces and I called her and told her not to.
",3
3423,"My 4 and half year old daughter liked it for a few days and she is no longer interested in it any more.
",3
3425,"To be honest, I didn't expect much given the cost, but was still disappointed to find out the box is made of cardboard (albeit very sturdy cardboard). Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it. Still, it's meant for a child which means it's not going to last forever regardless of what it's made of.
",3
3442,"The description was clear and the illustration was done well. The grandchild that received this music box was so pleased especially to find the little hidden boxes in the sides of the jewelry box.
",3
3457,"This musical jewelry box is very pretty. It is displayed in my daughter's room, and she does not play with it. From the moment we received it, we noticed that the knob that one uses to turn on the music kept coming off. This is part of the reason we thought it would be a good idea to keep it out of her reach, since she is still young. This knob is a choking hazard. Someone moved her music box, not knowing that the knob falls off easily. Unfortunately, when we checked the box, sure enough, the knob was gone. We have not been able to find it. We have to use the knob from a different music box when we want to play the music. The box should be more durable that that.
",3
3507,"These earrings were really cute, however they break easily. Must keep them in a safe place where they cannot get broken.
",3
3535,"At least that's what I felt. I was hoping I could wear it casually but I can't because it's so bulky.
",3
3545,"It was great while it lasted, 2 days. I suppose I could epoxy the cord back in but really it should've been better glued to begin with. It pulled out with only a mild tug as I was going to put it on, not anything out of the ordinary. Oh well. I really would have rated this a 5 had the cord not come off the clasp, as it is a very nice leather necklace, smooth & finished in appearance, not rough at all.
",3
3558,"Ordered the tag and started wearing in May. The red paint from the medical symble is all gone from the front of the neckless. Other than that, its fine.
",3
3562,"Nice quality item, particularly for the price. Only problem is there is no clasp and my husband couldn't get it over his head. So measure to see if it will work for you.
",3
3585,"I purchased these earrings to wear on my wedding day, and they are beautiful...from the front. The backs of these reveal how cheap they really are. Unfortunately one of the earrings does not hang completely straight, and keeps tilting to the left, so it shows a bit of the back... which is disappointing. I may try to tighten the hinges to see if I can force it to hang straight...otherwise I will have to return them.
",3
3624,"This ring looks nice, but in person it is a bit big and masculine looking for a woman. Quality appears to be pretty good and sizing seems right as well. The image makes it look more delicate than it is. I still like it though and have worn it almost every day since I bought it. (I had no problems with the seller and it arrived a day before expected delivery).
",3
3636,"It's a pretty ring, but it's not made in Ireland...it has Thailand stamped on the inside of the band. I would much rather have had a REAL Irish Claddagh.

3654,"This v collar choker is pretty but it doesn't hang like I would like it to. I will not return it. May give it as a gift. Nothing wrong with it....maybe just my neck???
",3
3680,"Very simple design. Extremely light and thin-feeling, but there's no high risk of breaking it since there's no parts extending off this ring.
",3
3681,"this ring, to me, looked a little more dainty than it turned out to be. It's almost too chunky. The lettering isn't engraved into the silver as it looks either, it's more like the ring is hollow and the letters are holes.ehhh... it's ok. Don't love it, don't hate it.
",3
3682,"Elated is how I felt when I received this bracelet as a gift. Disappointed is how I am with the fact that it's so small. By adding just 1/4 to 1/2 an inch more to this bracelet I could enjoy wearing it so much more. At 7"" it's too small to wear comfortably. I'm looking into trying to find a way to add length but haven't found one yet. As for the color and style, they are just what I would want in this type of bracelet...the only thing holding me back from giving it more stars is the size.
",3
3689,"These earrings looked much better on the website than they do in real life. They are quite bigger than I expected and the hook part of the earring is very long & can look a bit strange because of it. One of the earrings had a deep gouge in it, but it isn't too noticeable unless you look at it closely. I guess I was hoping they would be nicer, but I do plan on keeping them.

",3
3705,"I bought this earring in about eight different colors. This is a strange one because it claims to be jade and yet my pair has more of a yellow tint to it rather than the lovely pale green that's shown in the picture. It is also smaller than I thought it would be.

3714,"the chain of this product is really thin that you are worried all the time it is possible to be cut off but the butterfly's size is not that much badit is not a good present for your wife or girlfriendremember that

4138,"its smaller then expected but it arrived earlier then expected and my girlfreind is happy with it. so i have no problem with it at all
",3
4150,"They're definitely cute, but be aware that if you're allergic to sterling silver, you're allergic to these. The posts that actually pierce your ears, and the piece that actually sits on the front of your ears, are either sterling or some other metal NOT white gold. I'm still waiting for my ears to heal.
",3
4162,"When these earrings came in, they were smaller than I expected. The backing was bent, so the earring was not secure on the ear. I thought about returning them but the recepient said she would work with them......not happy with the purchase.
",3
4164,"These earrings were a wonderful surprise. I didn't think that the finish would be as high gloss as it is. They fit nice and snug. I just ordered them to use an Amazon gift card that I had earned on a reward site. If I had only knew that Amazon.com sold jewelry this reasonable and this inexpensive I would have been ordering some little earrings from them. The only negative thing is that they are so light; but that is to be expected in the small gold content and the price. All in all a pretty good deal.
",3
4181,"I needed to replace a pair of sterling silver earrings & opted for these 14k white gold ones. They're what I expected & would rate them higher, except for the teensy weensy eensy weensy backings. Seriously, visually impaired and/or arthritic baby boomers will have a problem using these. Hopefully I can find replacement ones 'cause I'll lose sight (pun intended) of these wee little backings sooner or later. I like the earrings just fine, they're what I expected. It's just those teensy weensy eensy weensy backings. Magnifying glass not included.
",3
4194,"I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm sizes in the past. I was happy with all, but not with this new pair of 5mm size. These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner. While they look good, the posts are very slippery and the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily. I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost). Otherwise, they would have been fine. I returned them and would not buy this pair again.
",3
4201,"The earrings are pretty, but as other reviewers have noted the backs are very, very small, and they do slip right off of the post. The post are quite a bit shorter than average also. Mine were also packaged poorly: one of the earrings were inside of the lining of the velvet pouch making me at first thinking one was missing. There was also some kind of a sticker inside the pouch which had one of the backs looped into it. It was very difficult to remove. It didn't matter anyway because the backs were worthless and fell off the post right on the first wear. I bought these earrings thinking I would just leave them in for everyday wear and be able to sleep in them, but the way they are made, I don't feel comfortable doing this as I know they will fall out and get lost. Earrings are pretty however and so far aren't bothering my sensitive ears so will be keeping them, and using one of my old backs from another pair. This was somewhat of a disapointing purchase for me.
",3
4206,"Just received the earrings (white gold). Major design errors. Never seen earring with such short post. If the post is short, the backing has to be bigger as compensating factor to keep the earring sitting properly and preventing it from slipping off the little backing. But the backings are extra small, not just small. It will just be matter of days that the earrings slip off the ears. I should have taken heed of comments made by other purchasers in such respects. The only way to wear this pair of earrings is as suggested by other purchasers: to use other backings which are appropriately sized to hold them.Also, the ball is said to be 5mm, but compared to my other 5mm ball studs, this one looks more like 4mm. That moving display picture is deceiving: not in proportion with the actual product.Otherwise, the earrings are fine. Solid, good shine.
",3
4212,"I have a small/medium sized lobe and have to say that they're really cute on but I was really paranoid about them falling out. The backing is really short and the clasps are flimsy and TINY. I have never seen a clasp this small before; it looked almost as if they were meant for baby earrings. Because the clasp was so thin and small, they would move out of place and slide while wearing them. I wanted these for casual wear, but couldn't justify having to worry about them staying in all the time. Also, they didn't feel or look substantial, very, very light in weight and color.
",3
4213,"I really like the studs, but the backs might as well be made out of tin foil. From the start they did not secure the earring and bent terribly out of shape when I tried to squeeze them to fit tighter on the post. I ended up tossing the worthless backs and using ones from another pair of earrings I own.
",3
4216,"I purchased these in yellow gold a few weeks ago and could not be more pleased. They seem to be made quite well and have a nice luster to them. I had no trouble inserting them and little difficulty putting the back on. Even my big man's fingers were able to put the back on the post. Maybe it was beginner's luck because I have struggled with other stud earrings with equally small backs.I like the 5mm size. It seems to be just the right size for a man. Attractive without being ostentatious. I only have one earlobe pierced so buying earrings in pairs means I always have a spare. Right now I expect to get many years of pleasure from these earrings. If my opinion should change I will try to remember to update this review.ETA: I almost forgot to tell you. These earrings actually come with a ""Made in America"" tag. That made me very happy I ordered them.UPDATE after 2 months: Well, they were nice while they lasted. It's a good thing I have that spare earring. I've had to change this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. The ear nuts that came with them are apparently a little loose. I lost one earring after wearing it for about a week so I've purchased replacement ear nuts. Hopefully they will work better than the originals.To be honest, I wear an earring 24/7 including when sleeping or showering. I've been doing that for several years and this is the first time I've completely lost an earring. I've had some come loose but they loosened gradually enough that I always felt it before the ear nut came off completely. The reviewed earring must have come loose and fallen out quickly enough that I didn't feel anything.FURTHER UPDATE: I found the earring that had fallen out and tried a spare ear nut on it. I had purchased several different sizes here on Amazon and found an ear nut that fit snugly enough I don't think I have to worry about it coming off. This earring is now back on the ones-I-like-to-wear list. I intend to go through all of my stud earrings and replace any ear nuts I suspect will not hold well.
",3
4218,"Cute..stay shiney but the backs are too loose and fall off the posts. I had to use other backs from a different pair of earrings to keep the earrings fron falling out if my ears! I was dusappointed.
",3
4223,"I really liked the earrings but they were a bit smaller than I expected. It's very hard to judge the size of things such as jewelry,mhandbags, etc, if you don't see them on a model. But the product was quality and the service from Amazon was excellent.
",3
4267,"I bought this chain for my beautiful gold cross, the color is rich & the chain has acceptable heft, however it measures only 1mm. I'm keeping it anyway as my cross looks good with it & it does feel substantial for the width, but be aware that this chain is 1mm, not 1.5mm. That is a big difference in a small (thin) chain at today's gold prices.
",3
4283,"The bracelet was nice. It's light weight, which I didn't really like but overall I think it was a good buy.
",3
4284,"this is a cute bracelet. close to 7 grams of gold for a great price. It also looks really nice on. Great valentines day gift.
",3
4294,"This is a beautiful necklace unless you're looking at it very closely. The gold has a nice tone and polish on the outside, it's the classic Rolo chain pattern that is neither too funky nor too formal, and the chain has a decent weight that feels real. I bought this as a present for my wife and she is happy with it. My only gripe comes from looking closely at the links. They are nicely polished outside, but the inside of the links is a little rough. That takes away a bit from the overall shine and makes the movement of the chain less fluid than it could be. Amazon's price is pretty low for this kind of chain so I'm not too surprised that the quality is less than 100%. I would have felt more satisfied with the purchase if the manufacturer had gone that little bit further and made sure both the inside and outside of the links were polished and smooth.
",3
4301,"Very poor quality and looks like metal, not gold. Stay away from any jewelry here!
",3
4311,"I got these for my wife for her birthday last year. They're fairly good quality, but I was disappointed when I viewed them for the first time in-person. The diamonds on the spiral portion are so small they seem nonexistent. The setting creates the illusion that they're much larger. Far away they look fine, but when you really get right up to them the look somewhat cheap. For the record, I knew the product description said 0.03 carat total weight, so I shouldn't have expected to be blown away. I think they'd actually look better if the manufacturer had gone with a smooth spiral rather than tiny tiny diamond settings on it.I'm giving them 3 stars because the current price is much higher than what I paid for them. In 2010, they were $130, but have gone up in price by approximately $100 now. If they were still $130, I'd give them 4 stars.

4376,"Ok, the stick doesn't come in a box. It is shipped in a plastic bag along with a little felt bag that is less than half the length of the stick itself. The felt bag is kinda useless. Lastly it need more than a bit of polishing. Granted these are minor sounding things but it is a bday gift for a friend and I was hoping it would present better than it actually does. It also has a noticeable curve to the stick which may or may not be normal (I don't know about jewelry related things, but you have been warned).

4463,"The first paid of earrings I received were quite visibly blemished. The American Pearl website says ""American Pearl does not deal with blemished, marked pearls. Blemished pearls whose surfaces show imperfections or spots are worth half the value of perfectly clean pearls."" I find it unacceptable that they did not bother to inspect the pearls they sent to make sure they matched this standard.I had to pay to send the earrings back, and they returned to me a pair of good quality earrings. The customer service was good. But overall, it left me frustrated.

But it is pretty and very feminine. Would give 3.5 stars but option not available. So if you don't mind a thin chain go for it it's lovely.

4522,"This is pretty, but really, really small. I bought it as a gift for someone who can pull off dainty, and it's not like I *didn't* expect delicate, but I didn't process what the given dimensions meant when I ordered it. (Okay, so maybe I was also in a Christmas present-buying panic. I didn't say it wasn't my fault.)Anyway, pull out a ruler and see just how small 12 millimeters really is, just so you know what you're getting.

4568,"While I like the charm, I have to be completely honest in that I was slightly disappointed. I expected it to be much more substantial. It is very light weight and the diamond presence is very small. The design, however, is very pretty and I really like that aspect of it. Some might like the weight of it because it won't weigh down their charm bracelet or make a lot of noise. I just happen to like my charms to be more substantial.

4576,"As far as I can see, there is no sterling silver marking of any sort on this pendant. I don't see an ""S"" or circled ""S"" or a ""925"" or anything like that. It would be tricky to put the marking on but this could have been perhaps been done on the bale or else on the sides in the scrolling somewhere.I am not implying that the pendant is not sterling silver as represented. But if it's important that your jewelry pieces be individually marked, this pendant may not be for you. There was a tiny Sterling Silver paper tag that came with the pendant though.I will pull this review or revise it in the event that someone can point out where exactly the marking is on this pendant. With a magnifying glass, I was unable to see it anywhere. I did not test the metal with any of the metal testing kits out there.

The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the presentation. It came in a tiny plastic ring box which I felt looked very cheap. I bought a real leather ring gift box to present it to my friend, it made it look ten times better.

4663,"The charm itself is perfect. The luster on the laquered shell is nice and the color really stands out against a silver charm bracelet. I felt the clasping method, however, was poorly thought out. For any charm bracelet that is robust enough to wear on a daily basis, the split ring style clasp will distort and not return to its original shap after it has been placed on the bracelet. My wife kept getting it caught on her clothes (sweaters were constantly snagging). I had to remove the split ring and replace it with a purchased locking c-jewelry clasp. I am not a fan of having to upgrade jewelry after a purchase, thuse the low star rating. The

The back of the ladybug is hollowed and it has the word CHINA written on it. thankfully it's not that easy to see in plain sight. Otherwise, the quality is good so far, I've had it on for three days now and everything is ok.

4671,"I love this little charm...It's very cute, and does look pricy. The only problem I have is that I'll have to make alterations for it to fit my pandora bracelet. The hoop the lady bug swings from is too small to fit on my bracelet.

4858,"I purchased this necklace for the first time in August 2010 in my quest to find something shiny, durable, and sturdy. I wear this necklace everyday - including when I run, climb, ski, etc (not swimming), and I only take it off occasionally. The first one last over 2 years!! It stayed nice and shiny with minimal kicks in the cord. I did find that small kinks could cause my hair to get caught in it, as another review noted.Fairly happy with it, I purchased a replacement, and this one has lasted less than 1 month! There is a significant kink in the cord - way bigger than any that were in my first one - and I am very afraid that this weak spot will cause it to break already. I am not aware of any outstanding event that caused it, I just noticed it one day. I am hoping this one was just an outlier but am still hesitant to buy a third one. I suppose the take away is that no necklace is invincible!

4880,"The chain was purchased to replace a white gold chain that had stretched and broken. The chain was shipped quickly and appears as pictured. However, the chain caused a metal allergy severe enough that it can't be worn any longer. The recipient has several other solid silver chains which cause no problems at all; she also has a confirmed metal sensitivity to nickel. I'm not saying the chain is not silver (just suggesting) but there does seem to be something fishy when other solid silver chains cause no problems and this chain causes allergic reactions. The chain was cheap enough that I won't be returning it (return shipping would be too great a percentage of original purchase price) but I will be looking to buy a replacement chain from elsewhere and re-gifting this one.

5010,"This has the potential of being the cutest turtle charm ever! But the only disappointment I had when receiving this item is that the sapphires are not as bright and shiny as they look in the picture. The sapphires are dull and look almost black. Other than that though it's a very cute lightweight charm. I ended up returning it (thank you amazon for making it so easy) so I've never worn it and can't tell you how it looks on a bracelet.

None of the stones look like they've been buffed and there isn't any sparkle to it. It's a very muted piece that will not take center stage.

5084,"I ordered a size 7 and this isn't a 7, it's some larger size, but otherwise is an attractive ring. It just can't be worn by the person intended unless we pay more $$$ to have it resized. We've ordered at least a half dozen various, other size 7 rings on amazon and other si tes, so I'd have to guess the sizing method for this specific ring isn't the most accurate.It's ended up in the ""pass it on to someone else"" gift pile. As I said, it's a nice ring; if you really like it and want to take your chances, go for it, but realize, there's a chance you won't get the size you're anticipating.

5089,"I was looking at this ring for quite awhile. When it went on sale, I finally bought it. When it arrived and I took it out of the box, I was very excited - it is beautiful and stones are bright and colorful. But when I tried it on, I was somewhat disappointed. It looks chunky, not feminine at all, although it was right size. I tried it on with the matching bracelet (from Kohls) and matching earrings (from amazon). The flower on the ring is so much bigger than the flowers on the bracelet and earrings. It does not look like a set (I was confident it would). In addition, it is rough on the sides and uncomfortable to wear. I have not decided yet if I am going to keep or return it. Will look at it again tomorrow.

5092,"This multistone ring is pretty and I bought it to complete my set. I already have a multistone bracelet, earrings and necklace. It looks fine alone, but when you compare it to other pieces of multistone jewelry, the stones are not as colorful as they appear in the picture. Maybe I just got one that wasn't as colorful because it was on sale. I'm not really sure if these are available as ""seconds"" or not. All I know is that the green and yellow stones are especially hard to see and the other stones shown are much lighter than they appear in this picture. I guess you really do get what you pay for!

The ring looks very nice, but the stone color is not like any of my blue topaz jewelry, more like a VERY light aquamarine, almost white! I am going to keep it anyway because it is a lovely ring and the price was right, but the picture is a misrepresentation, therefore only 3 stars.

5120,"This silver and emerald resin swirl ring is a nice conversation piece. When held up in the light, the emerald green resin is a rich and vibrant hue. However, the richness of the color is only enhanced when caught by the rays of light. Unfortunately, once the ring is placed on your finger, the clear-see-thru green color becomes a dark green more akin to jade and immedietly looses it's brilliance and clarity.The ring will always look nice, but don't expect the color you see in the photo unless your holding it up to the light.

I was amazed when I opened the box and saw the pendant. The picture on amazom.com looked to be twice as big as what I actually received. I still like it but cannot wear it on my omega which is what I planed to do. The tri colors show off the butterfly nicely, but would not have bought it if I had known how small it actually was.

My big problem, though, was the post that goes through the earlobe-- not only was it very thick (much thicker than the posts of my other earrings) but there was a rounded ball at the tip which really hurt when I pushed it through my ear.

There is a story behind the lapis stone, that it is a spititual stone, has spiritual qualities. I have read up a great deal on this and obviously believe it. I will be going back to Amazon .com to pick out a pricier one in the near furure. See my next item of lapis.

Amazon paid for shipping both ways, which was very nice of them.The replacement ring I got, the stone wasn't nearly as nice. The carving of the flower was not well done, it looks cheap, and the stone's color wasn't as vivid either.If the original ring I received hadn't fallen apart I'd probably give it 4 or 5 stars.I guess how happy you are with it depends on the particular ring you get.

5344,"The make of the ring is fine but the finish on the ring is too shiny. It looks and feels like shiny plastic. I don't know why it is different than other silver rings I have bought from Amazon. I have bought earrings here also that had the super shiny finish. In my opinion, the shiny finish makes the items look like they aren't really silver.

5351,"The actual colors are a little duller and there isn't as much bling to the actural product as there is on the picture. It's still a beautiful belly ring but not quite perfect for me. The shaft is too long and the front part too heavy so it weighs the whole thing down and front and makes the upper part of the shaft show...

5439,"The charm itself is cute, but small. But I expected it to be smaller (Description says 1 inch, keep in mind this includes the bail when it comes to this necklace). The bail on it however is kinda big, and unfortunately, it was not done correctly, because it is gapped at the point where it meets the fish like they didnt finish it. For the price of it, the chain should have been alot better, since the charm was so tiny. I ordered the 18 inch chain, and was sent the 16 inch chain. It was thin and extremely cheap.

And the sterling wire linking the pearls is VERY weak - my bracelet has broken several times in different places. I would not recommend this bracelet to anyone!*******I love coin pearls, and really liked the alternating circle-and-square design of this bracelet. The actual item I received, though, was of slightly inferior quality to the one pictured; the square pearls are more irregular in shape and have lumps and projections at the sides and corners. In addition, the 7.75"" length (as opposed to a standard 7"") makes the bracelet a little too big for average wrists - I had to have a pearl removed from mine to make it fit properly. Overall, the round and square pearls are matched well for color, and the design is striking, but it would be a better value if offered in different sizes and included better-quality square pearls.

The reason I have not put a lower rating is because I got a call about it a few days later offering a refund or exchange. By then I had already ordered another pendant, but she said it was the first time that has ever happened. I could maybe believe that but I still feel people need to know that at least one did break.

5807,"The other reviewer is right...you can only fit a limited amount of the big dangly hoopy earrings. More suitable for small ones such as studs. The holes are very close together, so you have to sort of skip a few to hang the next ones. It's sturdy, just don't be fooled by the pic, where it looks like you can fit a ton of earrings. =)

5873,"I design and make handcrafted jewelry. I ordered this to display my earrings. Even though the claim is being able to handle multiple pairs of earrings, I found it to be too cramped to overload. Nowadays, with earrings being long and large, the spaces tend to make the earrings overlap each other and my customers can't define each pair. So, the rack holds fewer pairs. If you just need this for smaller creations it would work out fine.

There was a strange smell when I opened the package. It smells like the stain they used on the wood, nothing disgusting. I wouldn't recommend this.

6126,"I bought this ring after seeing the stellar reviews. After receiving it, I have to say I disagree with most of them. The colors of some of the stones are washed out to the point of being almost indistinguishable from each other. In addition, the ring is an awkward size. It's not a chunky cocktail ring, but it's not delicately pretty, either. I think most people with small fingers should avoid this ring. On the plus side, it is very sparkly and shiny, and it does look solidly made.
",3
6134,"I bought this ring based on all the 5-star ratings. It isn't worth 5 stars. It is okay for $24 (with 30 percent discount) but not okay for $50. Someone mentioned that it only had one diamond. It has no diamonds. It is costume jewelry with a silver band overlayed with gold. You get what you pay for. For $24 it is fine -- but not a 5-star ring that looks like it cost a bunch.

6144,"This is a great alternative for boys who, like my son, are fascinated by the ballerina in the box. But the box is made of paper and he very quickly (without abusing it) had some of the glued seams coming apart. The dog also scraped the mirror pretty bad because it didn't always stop right away when the box was closed. I wish there was something a little sturdier for boys, like the nice boxes made for girls. We'll keep looking, this box wasn't it for us...

On the plus side, they have a beautiful lustre. Another reviewer stated that she bought these earrings as a gift for her little girl. Though the pearls are small, they could be worn by an adult. In sum, they are lovely earrings as long as you don't expect them to be truly pink. I paid $13.19 on sale for mine and will keep them and wear them.

6162,"Very cute necklace, but the clasp shows because it fastens close to the clover. Very odd, but I should have caught this in the picture because it clearly shows the clasp. Might just be a preference thing,but would be much better if clasp didn't show, cheapens it in my opinion.

6163,"The silver is too light for my taste. The color cheapened the beautiful design. I also bought some other silver jewelry from Amazon which had a darker tone to them. I wish this piece was just as dark. But for those who prefer bright silver, this is a really nice bracelet.

6197,"It's too bad that this necklace didn't work out for a gift to my mom. While it shows certain colors online, it came with different colored stones mingled in, which looked a bit funny. Also, it was very heavy and a bit awkward with the way it was beaded (Doubled). It could very well be a great necklace if it was a bit lighter and the colors were true to the description. We sent it back :(

6200,"nice looking, larger than expected. It was missing the ball that screws on to keep the jewelry in place, but a call to body candy's customer service informed them of that, and they will be sending me a replacement ball. ** they did not send a replacement ball. I talked to customer service who said they could just send a replacement steel ball that was missing from the original belly ring I ordered. Instead they sent a bright blue plastic jewish star navel ring! 1. the ball is acrylic and doesn't work for the stainless steel version I bought! 2. the replacement is bright blue, which doesn't even match the pink and clear stainless steel version I bought!! 3. Be honest when consumers call you on the phone with problems. If you could not garuntee I get the missing stainless steel ball, tell me that, and give me options!! don't just send me some reject plastic version that doesn't match or I can't use!!!

6210,"I received the diamond earrings the other day and was very excited until I opened the package. I must say that I was very disappointed in the size. They are so small! If I was purchasing them for a newborn babe or a child, they would be perfect. They are pretty and have a nice sparkle to them, but the size is NOT what I expected. I purchase them as a Christmas gift for a very special friend. So far, I have not seen any men wearing diamond earings this small. Maybe I was expecting too much. When I looked at the illustration, the earrings looked like they were larger and could be worn by a man or woman. Based on the size, I am not sure if any adult would wear them. I plan to return them and take the time to just go to the jewlry store and see what I am actually purchasing.In all fairness, the earrings are pretty and have a nice sparkle to them. I am not an expert on buying diamonds. I should do my research first then go to the jewlry store...not buy them online from a company I do not know anything about. And, maybe the size of the diamond actually equates to what I paid for them. I have no way of knowing unless I take the time and have a jewler appraise them.

First of all it was shorter than 16 inches, so it didn't fit as I expected. Plus, the color wasn't that impressive. Almost looked white. Needless to say, this will be the last Dahlia Christmas pearl necklace. What a shame :(

I think I was expecting something more like that.I give it three stars because the necklace does look wonderful with the dress I wear it with, so it was totally worth the gold box offer price.

The service was great(fast shipping, arrived in a black velvet bag), and the ring is sized perfectly, but it is too delicate for me. I read the specs before buying, but the rose is a bit on the small side. Good for those with skinny fingers; good for those who wear a size 5 and under. The way it is designed also makes one side of the leaves behind the rose thicker than the side. It's a bummer, as I was really excited about getting this, but it just isn't up to my expectations.

I was also very disapointed to find out that the price of the item in the Eves Addiction printed catalog was $40 compared to the $62 I paid online from the same vendor. It is the ""Spring 2008"" catalog, so it is not that the ring has just been reduced. Am I beeing punished for buying online? The most outrageous part is that the company itself sent the catalog along with my order. I find that to be a very inconsistent and unprofessional way of doing business.

Unfortunately, because of the red on white, in sun light or florescent lighting, the red looks pink.

Just for an evening out or dinner or something, they're fine, but beware the length of time or suffer the consequences lol (I usually suffer :-D ).

My main way of judging quality is simple...I have lost the balls of 6 bellybutton rings since I had my son, as he kicked them out when he'd lie on my chest. Since I've been wearing this ring, that hasn't been a problem. It resists even the most squirmy of newborns.Updated, two months later. The gold plating has rubbed off the ring and it has turned black from skin contact. I won't buy another gold-plated piece of belly jewelry.

The gold band is not much thicker...fairly thin. I don't really think the garnets are necessary and would prefer the ring without it. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have the garnets, but instead make the band just a tad wider.

The only problem that I have with them, is that the wire part of the earrings--you know the part that drops into your lobe? One of the wires is about a quarter longer than the other one. Making one of the earrings somewhat longer than the other one.I don't know if this was some kind of manufacturing glitch or what? But it is very apparent to me.Because they are fairly casual looking, I won't really worry about returning them. I just wish that the people who are in charge of sending their products out, would inspect them to the point where something like this doesn't happen.In the end, it makes me nervous about ordering from this company in the future.

6784,"I am very happy with my purchase,except for one thing. I ordered a size 51/2 ring and was sent a size 6. It is a bit too big for me. I will think twice before ordering a sized article again.

6802,"These earrings are very pretty, and look to be well-made. However, be aware that the large blue beads are NOT symmetrical, as shown in the picture. They bulge out on one side of the earring, so they look cheap. When worn, they look okay from the front or back, but the side view reveals the asymmetry. I tried slightly bending the wire of the earring, but it didn't help. These were for a Christmas gift, so we didn't have enough time to return them or get a new gift... I'm hoping the recipient either doesn't notice or doesn't let it bug her. It bothers me, though, because I assume that beads are always symmetrical. It almost looks as if the hole that they put the wire through is slanted or off to one side. Hard to explain, and I wish I had taken pictures... Trust me, if you're buying these for yourself and have the time to return them, go for it. Hopefully, you won't get a bad pair like I did. If you're getting them as a gift, I would look elsewhere.

6820,"Nice Necklace, it was too thick for the barrel on the pendent I indented to use it for. So I had to return it. It could have been used alone. But I did not need another silver necklace. It would be good to give a mm comparison in the description. Other sites use the ruler to show the thickness. This would have been helpful for me.
",3
6853,"Merchandise took much too long for delivery! - 3 weeks too long after promised date. Elaborate packaging for item.Book ordered on the same day came very promptly.

6854,"It looks really classy and elegant in the photo but it is not crafted very well. Think asian gift shop quality. The leatherette exterior had dents in it and the interior piece was roughly cut. Brass highlights are nice and it comes in a black cardboard box. At this price, I didnt expect too much anyway.
",3
6855,"The ring box was just like a typical ring box. I didn't like the way it shut though. The spring showed wear and cheapness.

6876,"I am disappointed with this pair of earrings. The silver doesn't look real even though the 925 signature is present. The amber is also not very attractive as shown online.
",3
6889,"I was really excited to receive this bracelet in the mail. It's beautiful, smaller than it looks in the picture and a simple addition to any outfit. Unfortunately, it broke about a month after wearing it. The clasp snapped & I am unable to wear it anymore. I would've given this item a higher rating if lasted longer.

6897,"i really like these... but the post is pretty thick, and u need to use some force to get the earring backs on. other than that, i love them!
",3
6900,"These earrings looked beautiful and I'd love to give them 5 stars, except that since the post is made of sterling silver, which is very bendable, just be careful when handling them. I accidentally smooshed one of the earrings and the metal band holding the stones easily became slightly loose. But for this price, you can buy several of them. I wish these came in 10k or 14k white gold :(

6979,"My 18-year old son wanted this cross for his birthday and loves it to this day.However, within a month, the chain broke. I figured it was no big deal, I'd go buy one from a store. WRONG.It's not sterling, nor a type of silver finish that ""matches"" anything in the stores that I could find.I tried a leather rope, but that didn't work too well either.My son now has it hanging in his room and it's irritating that he can't wear it.Otherwise, it's a lovely cross if that's what you're searching for.
",3
6980,"These are lovely earrings that look far more expensive than they are ... except for the ""Blue CZ"" stones. They look and feel just like plastic. It's a terrible detriment to the set. I may have to have them replaced by a jeweler (if I can) in order for them to be appropriate for my brother-in-law's wedding. However, they look good enough that I'm looking for a matching necklace.
",3
6999,"While this earring looks pretty, it's much thinner, lighter and bigger than it seems in the picture, so I'm don't wear them much. I should have returned them, but they were a gift.
",3
7012,"The metal of the earrings almost overwhelms the small stones. They're pretty, but look a little naked. For the price though, a decent buy.
",3
7017,"The earrings are gorgeous and well made. Unfortunately, the part that goes through the ear huts mine terribly. It's flat, not a round post. And it's ""taller"" than a typical post earring wire's diameter. I was in pain putting them in, left them in for a day, and was in even more pain taking them out. I'd love these if they'd just redesign the post part so it is not as tall and thinner overall. Looking carefully at the side view, I can now see this detail, which I didn't catch before ordering.If you have larger holes in your ears and are not sensitive to post diameters, you'll be fine. But my holes have little give and these hurt unfortunately.
",3
7026,"While the front profile was kind of nice I didn't like the way the lever back was visible from the front profile. Also, while this stone is purported to be a simulated tanzanite, it really looks like a dark blue sapphire. If it's the tanzanite look you want, these aren't it. I returned them to the retailer and I waiting for my refund.

7337,"This is a bracelet I will wear casually and not really care too much if anything was to happen to it. The quality isn't too shabby as the other reviewers suggested, but I do agree that the stones are VERY light blue in color.Suggestion: only get if you can get it for a super discounted price like I did. I wouldnt pay anymore than $20 for it.

",3
7474,"I love the design of this and it shipped fast! Be careful with the o rings, they are not sodered and it pulled apart with just normal wear several days after purchase. I was lucky and heard it hit the floor. It was also disappointing that the little dangling heart has a giant word CHINA stamped on it (makes it look cheap).

7526,"Well, I was really excited about this ring, but when it came in, it was so yellow that I think all the color drained from my face when I saw it. I really tried to like it, but couldn't get past the yellow. Other then the color, which it does say is low, it was a beautiful ring. Just not for me.
",3
7538,"The sapphire I received wasn't as blue as the one in the photo. The diamonds surrounding it were a lot smaller and the sapphire looks scratched. This makes me wonder if the sapphire is really genuine. Also, the box it came in was crushed. I need a new one to put it in before I give it away as a Christmas gift. To be fair, the pendant is still pretty just not as beautiful as it is in the picture.On the bright side, the shipping was fast. I am unsure if I'd ever order from them again. A solid ""maybe...""
",3
7549,"I adored the look of this pendant...when looking at the pictures. Even though I read the descriptions and knew how big this was...I bought it anyway. Shame on me. Its rather unwieldy in its design and is heavier than I wanted it to be. Although it looks nice over all, I certainly wish now that it was a bit smaller or lighter. I still wear it of course, but I certainly will pay more heed next time I'm told something is this large.

7567,"Saw these on the Deal of the Day two days before Valentine's day at the bargain price of $29.95 with free overnight shipping. Couldn't pass it up. They're tiny little diamond chips, so the image is misleading (hey, you have to be realistic about your expectations... I knew that 1/10 ct tw meant that they would be small, so I don't have much sympathy for someone who thought they were getting the Hope Diamond for under $30 based on the picture), but that didn't matter... she was surprised and thrilled to get something since we usually don't exchange Valentine's Day gifts. It was the thought that counted, and it made her day.

7632,"very cute but very small, the picture presented varies greatly with the original size.the earrings are like for a girl under 5 years for big size mismatch.but they are very cute and I'm still happy with the purchase.
",3
7637,"Can't complain about the service that, as always, was faultless - but the image of the earrings needs to clarify the actual size. The earrings are very small (approx.twice that of a pin head). I did expect them to be small for the price they were, but maybe not qite as tiny as they are. Probably still good value as they claim to be actual diamonds set in white gold.

7641,"The sparkle was beautiful, but the earrings were SO tiny that I didn't even think they were in the pouch they came in...they were supposed to be a gift and I was embarrassed to give them because they were so little...

",3
7646,"I guess it's my fault for not knowing what exactly this size looks like in real life,but in person, these are soooo small that they actually look like a nose earring or newborn earrings. I would suggest something larger if you want them to actually be seen.

7647,"I was not very impressed with the 10k white gold round diamond stud earring. The stem was a little long and when wearing them touch the back of my ear all the time. They were not as pretty as you showed them.

7648,"The earring is not as big as it appears in the picture but is good for the purpose I need which is as a second earring to compliment another earring. It would be too small for the primary earring for an adult however, would be nice for a child. I purchased them at a really good price and feel with the quality and all I received my money's worth.
",3
7653,"This was to be a gift for my mother. After receiving them I thought I would exchange for a larger size. I had a hard time with returning item as I did not take computer receipts, and the girl did not know how to return an online purchase.

7685,"way too small. Picture is misleading. Pretty but I think they will go right through my daughters holes in her ears.
",3
7695,"The earrings are petite and well made; pretty if you don't look too closely. The diamonds don't look like the illustration, but cloudy. I expected them to be small and certainly not perfect - however, I am disappointed that the quality is not better.
",3
7701,"I purchased these for my wife when they appeared in the 'deal of the day' section, and did not read the description very carefully. This is definitely a case where the top down view is decieving. I expected a simple, modest, pair of earings she could wear at work.These were tiny -- really baby sized earrings. Look at the side view before purchasing, and note the size of the backing. It's a small backing, and the earrings themselves are the size of a ball point pen.As long as you are aware of the size, I didn't see anything wrong with the quality. They seemed fine. But I expect them to get lost very quickly.
",3
7702,"The studs were cute, but a little small. I would not agree that they are the size of a pin-head or . (see the other reviews) but they are certantily not big. I returned them b/c I was too afraid of loosing one. If you are in the market for a second pair of earrings or nose ring, I think they'd be perfect. I think Amazon should be take pictures of these earrings that are ""too scale"" because the picture is decieving.
",3
7717,"I bought these earrings for my girlfriend for Christmas. I thought: hey, they're only 50 bucks, why not. When they arrived, they were just about the smallest things I have ever seen. They are barely bigger than this period---> . I guess I got what I deserve for buying diamonds off of the internet, but at least my girlfriend still loves me ;)

7721,"They are the tiniest diamond earrings I've ever seen. I wore them nonstop a week and no one ever saw them. I do like them.

7725,"They are REALLY small, like maybe big enough for toddlers. They seem to be real though... seventeen, eighteen, ninenteen, twenty.
",3
7728,"I cannot wear cheap earrings. I started to develop an allergy to sterling silver which for years did not bother me. I decided to buy these white gold earrings and these were my first (real) gold earrings. I'm sad to say they bother my ears. Granted it takes a lot longer for the white gold earrings to start irritating them then sterling silver earrings; however, I was hoping they wouldn't bother my ears at all. My guess is that the post isn't white gold or the post is white gold and I have a problem with gold as well. :( I have another white gold earing coming in today (from another company) and I'm hoping that doesn't bother my ears.About the earring itself. As others noted they are small. I went in knowing they were small but I was still surprised as how small they are. Let's put it this way...the earring back is bigger then the entire earring. I was afraid when I took off the back that I would pull the earring through my hole, which has happened in the past with similar size earrings. They do add a nice little flair. I wore them in my second hole. I still plan on wearing them when my flair ups go down because they are nice. You cannot tell they are a lower quality diamond with your eye because the diamond is so small.
",3
7730,"A very nice set of SMALL earrings! You get what you pay for but the picture was very deceiving.... They make them look like they are a lot bigger than they really are. Look nice and worth what i paid...
",3
7739,"These cute dainty little studs are great as second hole earrings. They are teeny tiny, but I expected that, so I was not disappointed. I also bought a round pair and discovered that the princess cut appear alightly larger than the same carat weight in round.
",3
7744,"Nice pendant, smaller than I expected though. The pendant is nice to add to a separate chain because the one that comes with it is just about worthless. It's a tiny little thing suitable only for a little girl.
",3
7751,"It's nice enough, did not realize it would stick out so much. I wanted to where it with my wedding set but found that it looked better alone. I think if I stacked it with some other rings like it, it would be very pretty

7754,"This is a beautiful ring, and I really liked it. Only problem is the stone fell out, and I chucked it int the woods oooopsie! Besides from that little mishap, very nice looking and exquisite design.
",3
7767,"The chain wire fits comfortably and is of good quality. It is less strong than I thought and so I cannot wear all my pendants. The fastener also takes a little getting used to. Still, it is good value for the money.

",3
7838,"I picked this out as a gift and I loved it! I got multiple compliments on it but my biggest concern was the clasp. It easily would break open and the bracelet would just fall off (changing clothes, sleeping). Maybe I was too rough with it but it's great for the price. If they found a more reliable way to close it it'd be a five stars.
",3
7848,"This is a decent cheap opal bracelet. It is very pretty, but there were a few drawbacks that I had.-You can't really see the diamond accents as they are very small-The latch on mine had problems and wouldn't come apart. I had to do some modifications to make it work.-I gave this to my girlfriend as a gift and she wore it EVERYWHERE. She never took it off for anything. After 4 or 5 months, one piece of the latch just fell off and disappeared, rendering the bracelet useless. I am impressed with how long it held up, actually.Conclusion: For the price, it can make a nice little gift for someone. Just be aware that there could be a few problems. Try and treat it nice to prevent problems like the one I bought had.

7880,"I purchased this for my boyfriend(now husband), he loved it and wore it every day. After a couple of weeks, we noticed one of the stones was missing. Then a couple weeks later another. This went on and we finally had to get rid of it. It's evidently not for every day use at all. I do have to say that it was beautiful while it lasted.
",3
7889,"The bracelet was in an attractive box and it shined upon opening. I bought this for my sister and she loved it. She wore it daily and after a few months the clasp broke. For the $$ I was expecting better quality for the duration. She fixed the clasp and it is fine now.
",3
7901,"This pendant was gorgeous when it first came, but after wearing it daily for a couple weeks, I noticed the green paint on the leaves was chipping off, and fading out. I'm not sure what I could have done to prevent this from happening. I didn't wear it in the shower and it was always on the outside of my clothes, so it wasn't rubbing against anything. Now the only thing I can do is either try to remove all the green paint, which would leave it looking really plain, or buy paint that I can use to repaint it, which would be a hassle. If I had known this was going to happen I wouldn't have purchased it.
",3
7909,"These came in handy in a pinch for work, since we weren't allowed to wear any visible piercings. The backing is poor, however. It's just a little clear elastic on the back, so they pops off really easily and get lost. They're hard to see when they fall out because they are clear.Good for very temporary occasions when needed, but I don't recommend this for long term use.
",3
7917,"I brought this to coordinate with a muli colored turquoise, and coral necklace, it matched color wise but the quality doesnt match the presence of the necklace. It's a lot smaller in person, and crafty.
",3
7918,"It is very pretty and the charm is hefty. My only observation is that, in my opinion, the chain is too thin/delicate for the charm. I changed it to a more substantial chain that pairs better with the heart.
",3
7929,"I love this type of eternity band. Unfortunately, one of the stones fell out after 3 times of wearing this ring. I have several of this type of eternity band and this is the first to have a stone fall out.

8027,"My boyfriend got this for me with a pair of CZ earrings... he said he almost returned the bracelet when it arrived. Although it's super sparkly and shiny, it looks incredibly fake due to the size of the stones. It does not look cheap or flimsy, just unconvincing. If the stones were just 2 mm smaller it would be far more believable.Also, the Amazon.com Product Description says, ""a line of 32 large round cubic zirconia stones."" The bracelet has 29 stones. This number is accurately written in the product specifications. I'm glad it isn't 32 stones-- it's super lose on me and would honestly fit better with 3 of the stones removed.I wear it going out to clubs when I don't mind if my jewelry gets a bit tarnished. The bracelet is currently on sale for $44.00 with Amazon Prime. It's originally listed at $95.00 and I think it's worth about $30.. maybe $40 since it's all silver.
",3
8041,"I bought this pendant because of the rose quartz, what I got was regular quartz. So I wasn't impressed with the crystal, but the picture of the fairy is exactly what you get. The chain was a lot nicer than I expected. I wish they would show a picture of the chain. You have to order it at checkout and they don't provide a picture. So I was pleased when it turned out to be a nice small link chain instead of the cable you see pictured with the pendant. So if you order this pendant, don't expect a dark rose quartz, you might not get it. But otherwise the pendant is very nice.
",3
8056,"Looks nice, but very uncomfortable wearing. Worth it the inexpensive price if you are wearing it for short periods of time.

8069,"small but sparkly stones but is definitely rough and a little hard to wear all day. makes a nice party or evening ring.
",3
8076,"The pendant looks as advertised and is very pretty, however it was shipped in just a small velvet pouch without the cardboard cutout that necklaces usually ship in, so the chain was severely tangled with the heart. It took over 2 hours with a toothpick and pair of tweezers to untangle it.Other than that, no complaints. If yours does not come all tangled up, you'll like it.
",3
8154,"I bought this product as part of a set of pendant, ring and earrings, and it has been the only piece that was not as good as the other products.The lower right amber piece fell down from its place and it was kind of thought attaching it to its position again.Also the color was slightly different from the other items and doesn't look like I expected.
",3
8159,"I thought this piece looked so beautiful online. It looks pretty in person, but the hamsa is extremely thin, it just kind of feels like a piece of tin. It is very pretty, though. I think this is a very nice gift for a young girl or a teen.
",3
8170,"For a price of less than $10, this is a pretty good cross. The pewter hasn't oxidized yet,but feels like ok quality. The design workmanship is a bit disappointing because the circular solar element has no knotting at all, which is the first Celtic Cross I've seen this way. This ring is simply smooth and mirror-like, and has the effect of looking like a 3/4 inch nickelplate washer. Looks a bit unfinished and therefore cheap, I must say. I really do like the black drawstring, which allows the Cross to hang at various heights, according to whether and how you want to show it. Again, for the price, one can't really complain. I didn't look closely enough at the photo to notice the inappropriately untooled ring element.

8175,"I've had this for 4 years now. I'm amazed it lasted this long. Cleaning pewter is not my strong point, but it's as easy as cleaning silver.

",3
8230,"Before you buy this take its size into account, it is 3/4 in. long, which is kind of small for my liking. I also thought its color was too dull. It's not very attractive. However, I did only spend $50. If you searching for a decent Virgin Mary medal, they are usually more than $100. Overall, it is better to view jewelry before you order it.

8234,"I purchased this for my girlfriend for valentines day last year. She wore it everday there after. Unfortunately the chain supplied with the pendant is very thin and has broken twice. the first time we were able to get it repaired, the second we decided to purchase a new chain. Diamonds seem to be good quality and look very beautiful. Good Product just have to be careful with the chain.

8246,"Smaller and less sturdy than I expected. But not too terrible for the price, I guess.

8281,"These erring look better online than in person. I hardly use them at all. They look rather cheap in person and stone is smaller than it looks online. Not sparkly at all. Disappointing!

8296,"I think this bracelet might make a good stocking stuffer for a young person interested in such. It is a simple beaded bracelet. Undamaged.

8299,"This is a kind of wacky necklace - a bit fun, a bit like a little girl wearing mom's jewelry. I think it is as pictured - very yellow/orange. But, I was not prepared for the length, which I found more than a bit awkward. The wrapped portion fell just below the bra line, so that the necklace end hung, in a particularly awkward location (on me). Had it been a tad longer or a tad shorter (which was what it looks like in the picture) it would be fine. I do not think the clasp quality is very good, but for the price, I cannot complain. This necklace is kind of reminiscent of the 20s with its length, and I definitely think it could be dressed up or down - but probably won't look right with a t-shirt.
",3
8310,"The title about sums it up... Nice, but not very neatly done (at least, mine wasn't) - for instance, dried glue showed from underneath the round decoration on the square pendant.
",3
8322,"this is a really cute bracelet, and for the price you get what you pay for. Seems like it could break very easily. Overall all its an okay purchase

8376,"This ring is a lot smaller than it looks. It also contains what appears to be a chip on the inside of the band.

8394,"This is a pretty little necklace. One problem, however, is how the chain attaches to the pendant. If the pendant falls off, it is difficult to loop the chain through the oddly placed holes. Now, it may be easier to do with younger eyes and hands that don't shake with close work, but I certainly had problems. Otherwise, the necklace is attractive and gets lots of compliments.
",3
8400,"I was mistaken in thinking these were adult size earrings. Evidently the term ""cute"" in a Silver Speck product name means child's size. I bent the hoop on the one I tried on, and feel sure that it will break soon if I continue to use them. So, while these would be nice understated earrings for a child, they are not for us big people.
",3
8419,"I ordered this because I needed something like this for the charm bracelet I purchased recently. The quality of this silver charm was good. But, it was a little pricy and filmsy. Maybe the half of the original price would be fair for this.
",3
8422,"They're on the small side and very light... and the backs bend. Nice color tho and they look great.
",3
8432,"I purchased this pearls as a gift for my wife but when they arrived, the came as broken clasp. So, had to send it back. Also, note that these are not round but semi round and they are mostly from 7-7.5mm. The luster is good however imperfections are very much visible to naked eye.
",3
8434,"I had a sinking feeling when I received this necklace. The label on the box with the item number was so faded I could barely read it. How long were these sitting in a bin? Did I even get the right item? I don't know how long they were stored before I bought mine - and it was six months ago - but the necklace was not damaged. It was just a scary looking label.So, I open the box and I'm impressed. The right size pearls, beautiful luster, silvery white (which I like), nicely matched and no perceptible blemishes! My jaw nearly hit the floor. I was astounded at the beauty of the pearls.Then I took them out of the box, and reality took hold. The sixty dollar bargain has big, fat, extremely tight knots. On closer inspection, the knots are clearly visible; this is the ""slight"" flaw. I imagine that stringing pearls requires some skill. I pictured myself trying to do it: all these roly poly little balls, trying to run a string through them. It would take some patience and practice, I think. I've never done it, so I can't claim to be an expert. But I did win the knot tying competition at Girl Scout camp, and I do know there are techniques. There's a correct knot, formed using a correct method, that one uses to connect objects in a form that accommodates function.Whoever strung these didn't know how to do it. The knots are almost as big as spacers, and other people can see them if they look closely. There are visible kinks in the strand. I've tried to get the kinks out, but to no avail. I decided to wear it anyway, and I've worn this necklace every week for six months. I haven't had a single compliment. Only worth buying if you get them for less than forty dollars. You can get nicely strung fakes for a lot less.
",3
8473,"I purchased this link along with 4 others. This one is very nice as are the others that match what I actually ordered. The company, however, sent one incorrect link and was completely unwilling to admit the error or to rectify the error. I was only able to get a refund after filing a claim with Amazon. I do not recommend purchasing anything from Pugster, but if you do buy with extreme caution.
",3
8478,"These were too glam for me, so I took off the bottom 2 rows of diamond shapes, I really like them now, and the quality is nice. They are shiny, so you would have to like the glam appearance of these earrings.
",3
8483,"For me this ring is just okay. One of the things that I didn't like is that the two-tone gold part of the ring is so light it barely looks two tone. Plus the finishing of the vermeil looks cheap to me. The sparkle of the stones is very good, but I'll be returning the ring.
",3
8485,"I was looking for filigree earrings. I found these. i am not in love with these. but ok to wear once in a while as these are little heavy. after two to three hours you start feeling them.workmanship is also not excellent but ok. I want these to sell under $20.
",3
8489,"This ring is comfortable and looks good in but the problem is when the top ball is screwed on all the way, the attachment for the charm is actually on the back of the ball, close to my stomach. The charm hangs off to the side slightly. It wasn't so bad that I wanted to return it but I found it pretty annoying. If you turn the charm like a quarter of the way so the attachment faces down like in the picture, the ball becomes too lose and falls off easily. This might have just been a problem with mine like a defect or something. Also the bottom ball is fixed and won't come off.
",3
8494,"Really cute and adorable but the actual pendent is so tiny it's hard to see what it is.
",3
8496,"Although I bought these earrings at an unbelivable low price--they were way to small for me. In the picture they look wider than they actually are. They are just a tad bigger than huggies and not as wide, so I sent them back. If you like prettty small earrings--these will be perfect for you. They shined very nicely.
",3
8498,"The ring didn't have enough luster or detail for me. Didn't care for the inside of the ring either. Not rounded solid on the inside, but rounded hollow like a trench.

8531,"After six months or so one stone turned a yellow coloration and the brightness in general faded. And again the first impression was excelent and for some that's important.
",3
8533,"I ordered this and got it in about a week, which is good. But I got one with dark colors and not pastels, so I wrote and told them about it and they said they would send me another one, which they did in just a few days, but they sent me the same one they sent in the first place. So either they have the wrong photo up or a crappy camera cuz it doesn't look like the photo.
",3
8550,"Loved these earrings online, but in person they were too small. I knew they had to be smaller than shown to fit in my ear, but these were significantly smaller and not proportional to my face. I ended up giving them to a pixie faced young friend who loves them.
",3
8559,"it is beautiful, but got dirty very fast! I'm still trying to clean it with the right stuff, but it's worth it, b/c it's gorgeous and a wonderful size. And too adorable.
",3
8570,"I thought these would look like real diamonds considering the diamonique name. However, when compared to my older $5 studs, I didn't see much of a difference. If you really want nice diamond earrings, I suggest you go real.
",3
8584,"Though I still like this necklace, I was a bit disappointed upon receiving it. It looked much larger in the picture, with longer cord and the stones looked larger. Given its actual size, I don't think it was worth the price.
",3
8594,"This ring is quite small. The onyx, which constitutes the bulk of the ring, is maybe about as big as my pinky fingernail bed, and my nails are trimmed!The silver is extremely light. Wish they offered a BIGGER model of this ring.I also though shipping on this thing was a ripoff. For a ring this small, even if it does come nicely packaged (it does--it has a little pouch inside a box), the shipping should be free, or at most, a couple of dollars.I can't necessarily say you are getting a lot of material for the money, and the shipping was a joke, BUT the turtle looks adorable, just as pictured.I would buy it again, just because I think there are few rings as cute as this one, and the onyx really does add a nice touch.I have had the ring maybe 9 months, worn the ring with some frequency, sometimes several days at a time, washing my hands, etc. and so far, the onyx is staying in, and the silver has not broken. So, it seems well put together...As a final note, I have serious doubts the silver is real. It NEVER tarnishes, unlike my other silver jewelry!! Seems dubious...
",3
8597,"Even though these were a very low price, when the $3.25 in shipping was added (to mail half an ounce), it became a very bad deal. For the same price you could go to any retail store and get nicer earrings. The photos are very deceiving. They look great (and the magnified a lot) in the picture, but the real thing is not as beautiful and multi-colored. I have bought a lot of jewelry for my daughter on the internet in the past few months, and most of the time, it is nothing like the photos. After this, I am sticking to the retail stores. That is where you know if something is really pretty or not. I thought that saving on sales tax and gas was worth it, but the postage/shipping fees kill any real savings, and then the fact is most of this mail-order jewelry looks like it was rejected by the Dollar Store.
",3
8610,"I am not unhappy with purchase. They are 2mm gold ball earings. but make sure you read and understand measurement carefully. 2mm is very small. ( this is what I did LOL ) An infant could wear them. They have stayed gold never pealed or tarnished.
",3
8615,"what a fool am I. Already one 'stone' from each earring has dropped off...and those 'stones' look suspiciously like plastic. they are so small and my eyes are so old that I can't tell for sure! I do wear the earrings; but, be warned, they are not worth what you're paying!
",3
8632,"This cross is very pretty but has two stones with very visible scratches. For a good job should choose stones best no matter the cost a little more

8641,"I liked the size of the pendant. The diamonds are so small, no one would even know they were there. No sparkle.

8719,"I don't own the bracelet but I wanted it for a while and then changed my mind. I give it 3 stars because it looks great but its a bit pricey and people complained about the stones falling out. You could probably find something similar at Claire's for way less then what you would pay for this.
",3
8776,"This is a cute necklace. It is fun to wear with casual to semi dressy clothes. It does break fairly easily. My boyfriend just tried to unhook it and it snapped .I did purchase another one. Not everyone will like it .It depends on what you are looking for.I would not pay listed price though. Amazon had it on sale.
",3
8782,"I got the earings as a christmas present and wore them on a few occasions. One night i wore them to a friend's house and when i got home one of them was missing. I later found it on the ground. the metal clasp broke and now i can't wear them because it won't stay in. They bend VERY easily. I've just given up!!
",3
8794,"When I took out my necklace, I was suprised at how small it appeared compared to the picture. When I tried it on, it actually looked pretty cute. However, I don't think it's worth $30.00. I think your paying more for the name on the necklace. It's cute, but if I had seen it in a store, I would have only been willing to pay around $15 for this necklace.
",3
8797,"The necklace arrived promptly and was packaged very nicely. I wasn't that impressed with the size, it was alot smaller then i imagined. The mecklace was very cute though. I expected the cord to be longer, also a little overpriced for what you receive.

8812,"My daughter will love this pendant as she is a Paris Hilton fan but I as a consumer think the product is of fair value. The pink string it hangs from is already kinked from shipping and will fray or break with wear. The pendent itself (cute) seems to be worth the money spent. Overall I give it a 3 -middle of the road product.

",3
8837,"I like the necklace and I think it looks adorable on. I can't believe on the other hand I paid $35 for it just because Paris Hilton's name was attached to it and I love novelty stuff like this. Sure it looks like some other stuff that has been released but it's jewlery...most of it looks the same anyways.So if you have the money and don't mind spending it order away. Everytime I have worn mine since it has arrived I have gotten tons of compliments. Besides we have to let Paris Hilton make a few bucks of her own :0
",3
8850,"I love the color of the stone which is very bright. I had a hard time getting use to the size at first because they stick out very far from my ear lobe. It was definitely worth the price and they are truly emerald green!!!

8868,"To be honest, I wasnt sure what I was going for...but wanted them for my husband who is an alabama fan. The elephants are a little small and look more pewter than silver. Husband hasnt used them yet...but again was trying to find something that was like fan-gear.
",3
8888,"This is a well made item, the only disappointment was that there was very little 'rainbow' effect from the stones, certainly nowhere near what is shown in the picture. I bought both necklace and earrings and this lack of rainbow effect was in all three stones.

8903,"I love the size and quality of these hoop earrings and would have given them five stars based solely on their appearance, but the &quot;secure joint and snap closure&quot; is not secure at all. I've already lost one earring because the closure is so difficult to fasten.

",3
8957,"I was very happy with this product in terms of size, color & quality all being as described. I was looking for a pair of earrings to wear day in and day out, without poking me while sleeping. These earrings serve that function well with 1 exception: they come out too easily! I would say the prong that extends into the closure needs to be longer.I have pulled out one earring by mistake on 2 separate occasions with 2 weeks: once while removing a shirt over my head, and once while pushing my hair behind my ear. Unfortunately with earrings that come out this easily, they can't serve as every day wear.
",3
8981,"I did not like this bracelet because I was expecting something shiny and my expectations are never to high. Anyways, the bracelet cam dull and weathered looking. I am rather disappointed but for the price, it's a steal!!
",3
9001,"I am surprised that the other reviewers didn't emphasize the problem with the size of the cord in relation to the charm and the awkward, stiff and lopsided way it makes the charm hang. This is a very pretty charm on a piece of cord that is actually too thick for the charm to hang naturally from. I had to take it off the cord and out it on a silver chain. It is pretty, but it doesn't really work as delivered. I also notice that the description says ""sterling silver clasp"" and it does not have any such thing. The cord is simply knotted on one end and looped on the other, as seen in the pictures. This actually made it easier to remove the charm, so it was a good thing. I received it as a gift so I can't complain about value, but I want people to know there is a glitch, especially if giving as a gift and won't get to see it, yourself.

9032,"I was looking for a dainty little bracelet for my ankle and this does not fit the bill once I saw it in person. I think that the spheres are a bit too big for my taste and it does not have that feminine dainty look that I was going for. This is what happens when an item is bought online sight unseen. No fault of the seller, of course, just not to my personal liking. However, item was as described and looks exactly like the pic. Others may like it though.

9070,"We bought these cute stud earrings for our 5 year old daughter who loves lady bugs. They are quite small however and three days after she put them in her ears I noticed that the pointed tops of the lady bugs had actually disappeared into her ear. We were able to carefully remove them but we won't have her wear them again. These are really quite cute and would be lovely for an older child or adult who's ears are not so soft still. They would be perfect for a cartilage piercing!
",3
9100,"Unfortunately the clasp was too large for me to slip on the pendant. My other wonder is why it wasn't packaged as a circle, instead of it being folded. Didn't make sense.
",3
9105,"I bought this item for use with a necklace pendant, and it works great for the purpose. But I've had it for about 3 months now, and the clasp is wearing out, and a couple of times I've had it randomly come off because the chain links were slipping out of the clasp. I tend to fiddle with the necklace a lot though, and I wear it constantly. So if it's something you're only going to wear occasionally, then this is will work great! Otherwise, I suggest maybe finding something a little sturdier.

9151,"I was browsing for jewelry for my wife for Valentine's day and stumbled across this item (again). You see I bought this for my wife last Valentine's day and she wore it for about 2 weeks rotating with another ring I got here from Body Candy as well. At the end of the second week we noticed that some of the interior petals had fallen off two of the three roses and by the end of the first month, one of the roses had broken off and been lost. She was a student at the time and hardly led an active lifestyle so we're not sure why it wore out so fast.As a side note, the second piece lasted much longer; about 7 months of continual use, before breaking as well. Not bad for the price I suppose, I never expected them to be heirlooms.

9230,"this ring is much larger in the picture. It is deceptive. The dolphin is smaller than my pinky finger nail and the band about as thin as a penny. It is pretty but could be much prettier and much more durable with a little more effort. You do get what you pay for, I will not be buying from this seller again though.

9332,"This 8"" bracelet is 7.8"" in length. And this 3mm wide bracelet is under 3mm, approximately 2.85mm in width. This shaving of size to save a little cost in gold is not an honest way of transacting a sale. A $75 gold bracelet should be the full length of 8"" and width of 3mm as described. I may return it or purchase a larger clasp. The one that came with it was diminutive in the extreme. But for this price I shouldn't have to.

9336,"I just bought this item as a gift. When I received it I found it to be very light weight. When tapped the face has a hollow sound. It is very nice looking but I am worried that under everyday conditions the pendant may dent and collapse. Especially since I did get this item to be worn under a bullet proof vest of an active officer. I'll write back to let you know if it holds up.Edit: It has been nearly a year and it still is holding up well.

9343,"I recently ordered these earrings and though they are beautiful, they look much different in reality than on the internet. I assume it is the quality of the picture provided, but I thought (before I purchased)that the earrings would be very thick and sturdy. Instead I recieved earrings that feel a little cheep and flimsy. In my opinion, the picture gives a viewer the impression that the earrings are made of gold that has been 'woven' together. Sadly, they are nothing more than a (very)thin layer of gold that has been pored into a mold.

9361,"I bought these earrings and they are nice, but no where on them does it say 14K. They are stamped ISRAEL. Did I get real 14K gold earrings?

9367,"These are okay but were a little cheaper-looking and more gimmicky than I hoped. I gave these as a present and felt a little funny because they almost looked like plastic. I think it might be because the metal is brushed. They look better when they are on the shirt than they do in the box (look like buttons), however.

It is not a true 8"" bracelet for two reasons: first, it only measures about 7.5 inches and second the lovely mesh is thick so it takes-up some length just because of the style. So, if you like a 7.0 or 7.5"" bracelet then this may well work for you. Enjoy!

9722,"I bought this in 2005 from the same seller, Samuel's Jewelers, for $49.USD, on Amazon.com. Now, 7 years later in 2012, it is sold at $99.---Same product, same make, same size and strength of diamond. Same exact item.This is my second honest review of this item, since the first review was not accepted due to brutal honesty. Now I will settle for diplomatic, yet objective honesty with to get the message across.This item is sold by Samulel's Jewelers, as said. In 2006, Samuel's Jewelers was bought by a parent company, Gitanjali Gems of India. This means that Samuel's Jewelers as a private business, gives its proceeds to its parent company, Gitanjali Gems(NSE:GITANJALI.) Gitanjali Gems is a public, billion dollar business: as of 2006, average price of 1 share of this business was $180. As of today in 2012, 1 share is priced at $310.The above statement is of relevance to this $99 item, as this item is both jewelry (white gold; which isnt true gold but rather true gold diluted with another metal, which reduces the costs compared to real gold,) and more specifically, a small diamond. A small diamond (literally, very small weighing in at 0.050 carats;) that was $49 in 2006 and is now $99 in 2012. So despite nearly almost doubling of the price of profits and the business new worth, the price of their items are also doubled. If a business is clearly making money, the price of their product should not increase. It should stay the same, or even, decrease. All these facts, numbers, and figures are true. Just go look up the information yourself if you must see to believe.Any person who is not an economist can agree to that the price should not have risen. This is an example of corporate greed.Aside from the corporate greed, it IS a nice product as reviews say. but not $99USD nice. The price is higher, yet the value is the same. This is the only subjective part of my review. Everything else above is an objective fact---->Numbers do not lie.
",3
9731,"I received this necklace as a birthday gift from my boyfriend, and I absolutely love it. The heart itself is a delicate .5 inches long (which may be small for some people) but it's really elegant. The diamond sits perfectly on the heart and it has a beautiful shine to it. Also, the seller also packaged it beautifully, and the chain doesn't tangle or knot. It's big enough to be noticed but small enough so that I can wear it all the time--I couldn't ask for more. The necklace deserves 5 stars out of 5.UNFORTUNATELY, my shipment was lost/stolen by UPS, so while it was supposed to arrive on my birthday, it never did.I realize that the seller is not responsible for the package being lost/stolen, but the seller IS responsible for customer service, which was awful.I called the 800 number given on their website and left message after message on the customer service line, and e-mailed customer support for four days straight, but I received no reply, and when I called UPS, they were equally unhelpful.Finally, after days of trying (my boyfriend was about to call the credit card and deny the charges for lack of product), I called the CORPORATE office (which was an out of state number, not the 800 number they give you, which was a major inconvenience) and I finally reached a human being, who claimed they couldn't respond to my messages immediately (immediately is within 24 hours, 4 days is LATE) because of all the e-mails/calls they receive everyday from OTHER customers and my complaint had to wait (hearing that made me feel REALLY special).However, when I reached a human being, they eventually cooperated and sent me a replacement overnight mail, which was very kind of them, but they should have given a refund for the shipping costs. So while I love my necklace, I was very unhappy with the service provided by Samuel's Jewelers. I have been ordering through amazon.com and other various online retailers since 1998, and I have never had such an awful experience.If you want to buy this product, my advice to you is to get Expedited/Express mail option provided by the seller, as the chances of it getting lost are far lower than with the regular 3-7 day mailing option. If the shipping and customer service hadn't been a nightmare, i would've easily given this review five stars out of five!
",3
9732,"The product is beautiful, lovely and a perfect gift. I had to wait more than 1 month to get it because it got lost and time response from the seller was slow. I had to send several mails in order to get an ""we are investigating"". The solution I got was I expected: ship a new one and was delivered fast. You will get a nice product but if something goes wrong in the delivery, be prepared to wait a while.

9735,"My boyfriend purchased this for me for valentines day and it looked really nice on the site. It came in a beatiful box but when I opened it wasn't what I expected. It still looked nice but it was soooooo small. The chain is the size of a thin thread and the pendant itself is about the size of the nail on my index finger (and I dont keep long nails).So to me, it doesnt see much like a necklace. Some people said they liked it because it looked so delicate but I think it looks so delicate that its about to break. And when you wear it around your neck, it looks kinda cheap cause its so small.So instead I wear it as a bracelet by puting the chain through the heart three times and wearing it like that. Its really nice as a bracelet for me since the chain is wounded around three times, I'm not as scared of it breaking apart. And it doesnt look too small for a bracelet.And to the guy that said you cant make the heart slanted like in the picture, I can with mine. Theres this really small kind of rectangle where you put the chain through. But its an irregular triangle, so one of the corners gives more space for the chain to go through while the other doesnt. You gotta find that corner. At first when I tried immitating the image, it didnt work but when I tried again like a month later, it worked.
",3
9742,"The item is definitely smaller than what I perceived it to be and the diamond is almost invisible. Surely the diamond in the picture is NOT proportionate to the pendant. Save for the size, it still looks beautiful.Shipping was very fast. Ordered on Thursday, here by Tuesday. I'll be coming back for more purchases, hopefully the size issue was a problem of this product alone.

I have small hands but like good size rings.This one is visually noticeable and is quite pretty so I am keeping it.However, this ring is rather cheaply made.The ring is a simple thin silver circle with the amber teardrops set on top.No design or heft to the band itself.The teardrops are attractive in shape and size.But like other reviewers, I wish the teardrops hugged the shap of the finger.The three teardrops are connected in a flat manner and would not allow adjustment to curve downward.Ring would be great if it had slight curved shape.I ordered this with matching teardrop shaped tri-color earrings from same companyCertified Genuine Multicolor Amber Sterling Silver Pandora Dreams Leverback EarringsAnd the earrings are terrific.Shipping was fast, well packed.

10077,"I had been looking for some fairly large white gold ball stud earrings for quite a while. The price on these was fair and they are actually a bit bigger than I thought they would be. They are very pretty and do not make my sensitive ears sore in any way. Both of them did arrive slightly scratched. I tried cleaning them but it did not help. From a distance no one would notice, but they are scratched. The earring backs are very small for the size of the ball stud.
",3
10088,"These are very nice shiny, perfect-sized earrings for the $12.50 I paid. HOWEVER, be warned, the backs to these are VERY small - TINY. I have never seen earring backs so small in my life. It took me 10 minutes to get them both in, and my ear lobes are red. I have long nails, so I imagine it would be easier for someone who does not.
",3
10104,"The earring itself is nice. The back of the earring left much to be desired. They fit very loosely and I lost one of the backs only moments after I put it on. I had to go find a old pair of earrings and use their backs. Not happy!

10106,"I was a little disspointed the earrings were hollow and the backs very small. However, for the price still can not beat it.
",3
10108,"Lost an earring the second day I wore them. I like the way they look, but I don't have much use for only one. The fit of the fastener on the post needs to be tighter. (Update: I found the earring! Because I really like these gold balls, I bought clasps that would not fall off. Tried every one at the jewelry store, and only one pair was tight enough. Paid almost as much as I did for the earrings. Conclusion: The post diameter is too small.)
",3
10115,"I like to gold ball earrings but the size is larger than I expected. I like to wear them in my second piercing. I now will wear them single.

",3
10145,"If you are interested in this item, please take a minute to look at my two cents. I'll try and keep it brief:1. Keep expectations on the quality realistic. These are nice earrings for the price, but think department store nice as opposed to jewelry store nice.2. They look better than they feel - i.e. shiny but of somewhat insubstantial weight for their size (see item #1).3. I don't regret buying them but I really wish i had replaced the backs, because the first time i tried them on I knew there wasn't enough friction with the post. The earring can be completely pulled from your ear without much force, something as casual as brushing your ear against a sweater or phone receiver is enough.Within 2 weeks of purchase i had already lost one of the earrings, and didn't even feel it coming out of my ear.
",3
10154,"These balls are nice, but they are too big for my ears. I cant keep any backs on them. I tried the ones they came with...falls off, then some clear backs and the earrings still fell out of my ears. Luckly I found them.
",3
10159,"Everything is great but it keeps falling off because the post is not secure. I wish it was made with a screwback or more secure back.
",3
10168,"I like how these look, but they are difficult to clasp when you put them on. They're also easy to bend because the metal is pretty thin.
",3
10254,"Decent, but very hard to grip to get open. Also, the slots are too narrow for a few of my rings. Overall, the case is nice, but the lock is cheap, so its really not even necessary. My 8 year old niece could break into it.
",3
10261,"These bracelets are very nice however only fit people with small wrists. I bought the bracelets to give to my friends but they fit very few people. The company advised they do not make them bigger when I asked.Warning, the silver is soft. The bracelets are very nice but if you tend to rest on your wrists, the bracelets get out of shape very easily. I would still recommend them
",3
10268,"I recieved this bracelet for christmas (2006) and was so upset to see it tarnish and turn an awful brown color within only a few weeks (no I didnt wear it in the shower). I bought myself another one because I loved my first one so much, but I only wear it on special days. I wish the silver plating had been done better. If you buy this dont wear it every day or you will be buying another one in a couple of weeks.
",3
10269,"I like the saying on this bracelet, I wish it had a different way of putting it on, a clasp of some sort or one of those rings w/ the bar. It has elastic in it to expand the bracelet... which makes it feel really cheap and I get nervour it will break.

10302,"I ordered these earrings for my Mom for Christmas... she actually picked them out &amp; had seen the size indicated online &amp; thought they'd be ok, but after she received them we realized they're actually quite small!!

",3
10304,"This is a nice little hoop earring. I have been looking for a really small pair of white gold diamond hoop earrings and these were exactly what I had in mind. The problem is that the diamonds are not very good quality. The diamonds are quite cloudy, but since they are so small, you really can't tell unless you look very closely. There is still some sparkle, mostly from the white gold prongs that hold the diamonds in place. If it were not for that, I would rate them 5 stars. I did keep them because the size is so perfect and the price was right, plus free shipping. Overall, they are OK.

The charms are of excellent quality and the chains are too. I haven't had a problem with the chain getting dull or green, this is real silver. I have worn this necklace every single day through sleeping, showers, swimming and working with handsy babies. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because the link that holds the charm to the chain broke on both of our necklaces. I can't keep my hands off the necklace and was able to save mine. My boyfriend on the other hand could not. He is currently in Afghanistan right now and wasn't able to hear it drop to the floor like I did and it is likely he won't find it. I am sorely disappointed and he is too. He told me he really wanted to keep it as a keepsake to remind him of my love for him. :'(Overall, I do reccomend this product however, I suggest going to Michaels or a craft store and purchasing teeny tiny keychain loops to attach to the charm.

I remember them from back when i was a teen. we couldnt find them in any stores nearby. it is better looking than i imagined it would be. the one thing i would recommend is that they used closed circle jump hooks, where the clasps attach to the chains. it makes it look a bit cheap, to solder them shut would be a better look & would add to the security of the chain. overall i am happy with the purchase.

10518,"This pendant was pretty, but small as other reviews have stated. I'm fairly certain I could have gotten it cheaper at a retail store. Chain is very thin. My son purchased it for his ""girlfriend"" (they are both middle schoolers) so it was fine for that purpose, but I'm not sure it was a great value. As I said, just OK.

10522,"This is a pretty bracelet, unfortunately the gold sparkles more than the diamonds do. They are of a low quality. Still I love the bracelet which was a gift from my boyfriend. He was even surprised at the size of the diamonds, the picture makes them look larger than they are - what you see is the illusion setting that they are in.
",3
10530,"This is a nice bracelet, but the stones are very dull, not shiny like most onyx stones I have. I would actually question if it's onyx or just some kind of black chip bead. I really don't know, but I don't really care for the dullness of the stone because it doesn't match my true onyx jewelry when I try to wear them together.
",3
10532,"Chips are beautiful but it doesn't seem like it's made to wear everday. The band seems like it has streched and can break at any moment. It's still going strong but it feels like I need to wear with care.

10547,"I purchased this 10k ring in lieu of the 14k with plans to have the stone re-mounted in a more solid ring setting by my jeweler. The setting is actually nice (wish I had purchased the 14k.)The stone is the problem - it is not cut properly. One end of the stone is angled down into the ring which ruins the nice rectangular/oblong look of the ring.Quality control must have had the day off when this ring was made.I also have the matching earrings & necklace which I love (I placed the pendant on a heavier chain)
",3
10564,"One end of the fastener came off after a short period of time. I didn't take the trouble to contact the company as I was able to fix it myself so I can't say if they would have taken care of it (although I'm pretty sure they would have, I didn't want to have to ship it). I was a little disappointed that it didn't wear better.
",3
10569,"I love this ring! I was amazed when I first opened the box at how clean and bright the stones were. Delighted! However, it cannot be solid 925 sterling silver (even though it's stamped). I wear this ring everyday and after about the first month or so noticed that the band was beginning to wear and the color had changed. This is not a tarnish-like color change. It appears that the sterling silver coating had begun to wear down and now shows a duller, almost copper/brass-tone coming through. Now I'm afraid to even polish the ring and can't get the dust out of the stones with just a fine brush so they've become foggy. :( I wish the company had been true to their claims of being sterling silver because I still get compliments on this ring and have seen many others that this company sells that are beautiful... but I want real sterling silver - especially when that's what I thought I bought in the first place.

10648,"At first glance I thought these are pretty earrings (they do sparkle and shine), but is states ""clear"" so that's what I thought I was getting. Once I put them on they look as if some part of it is painted (yellow no less), which makes them look a little cheap. Also the part that goes in your ear is curved which makes it very difficult to put them on. Sorry but I don't think I will be buying any more.

10783,"My husband bought these for me and I never took them out- they were for my 'second holes'. I loved them until I accidentally hooked my fingernail on one of them while washing my hair. The backing popped off and the earring went down the drain before I could retrieve it. It seems to me that for the price of these earrings the manufacturer could have made locking backings so they're not easily lost.

10839,"It's a cute little necklace, with emphasis on little... Picture is at least twice as large as actual item, maybe 3 times as large. It looks kinda like something for a child, rather than an adult. It is pretty though
",3
10871,"For the price paid, these are nice earrings but they are larger than they appear in the illustration and the lab-created opals look a little ""too"" lab-created in bright light. Also, the posts are super long so if you forget to take them out before you go to bed they poke into your head. I bought them when they were on sale for around $15 to go with a much more expensive opal and diamond pendant from Blue Nile so they really suffer from the comparison. On their own they are much more appealing.

10872,"It really looks good not as big as I thought it would be quite small. But I still enjoyed it and looks really nice.

10875,"Overall, the band is very pretty and a good value for the money. The side stones go well with my wife's .8ct stone with an I color.Our only complaint is the prongs, they are somewhat sharp on the edges and it hurts when you scrape it against skin, espeically when holding hands. I am going to take it to a friend and see if he can smooth it out somewhat.

10882,"I was looking to use these pouches as pill cases so an inside zipper was a must and, while the cost of the pouches was fair (even though I didn't need this many) and they were exactly what I was looking; however, I have one negative comment...the quality is disappointing. I have one in each of my pocketbooks. My black pocketbook is used the most and so is the pill case; however, the case is already starting to pull apart at the seams.

10892,"I ordered this for my daughter to give to her grandmother. It came wrapped so nice her grandma loved it. When she opened it she immediately put it on. After about 2 months though it started to rust. Even though it was so pretty I don't think i would buy it again because of that reason. It was worth it for the price to wear for a couple of months. I just wish it didn't rust because she loved the bracelet.

10896,"I like the charm bracelet, but hate the clasp, it keeps undoing other than that its very pretty and inspirational. It makes a simple and cheap gift with a message! comes with a gift box decorated and all, with satin touch inside. Good for teachers and nurses and co-workers (there are several other charms to pick from)

10918,"I think the price should be a bit lower for the quility of the product. I purchased this for my mother on Christmas, its nice and she was happy with it but it looked like I bought it at a dollar store. A+ for packaging. It made it look more expensive

",3
10974,"These are nice polishing cloths. I did not like how they were sewn together and dont know why they were. But i only gave it 3 stars because they claim one cloth has chemicals already on it for cleaning or polishing .. and i did not see any difference when just using the cloths with no actual other cleaners.. There are white and blue colored cloths , one that suppose to have a cleaner on it and the other to polish, BUT they dont clean or polish alone.. They are however nice cloths as they are, they are big and if use a brass cleaner with (for example) they work very great!

",3
11056,"Pricing reasonable for the product. The necklace and bracelet are fine. I lost both earrings first time I wore them. I think I needed to bend the wires a bit to make them less likely to come out. I've never had that problem before with this type of wire hook type earrrings.

11074,"This pair of earrings would be absolutely fabulous for sportsand long-term wear if it was made out of white or yellow gold,especially with a matte finish. I find I'm not wearing them much for sports,as was the intention, because of the look of the material (stainless steel).

11078,"This is a very small charm. It does not come with a clasp - I had to bend it open (needle nose pliers) and onto my wife's bracelet. The first one I received was missing the stone altogether. However, the customer service was nice and sent out a replacement quickly. Would buy again.
",3
11080,"The earrings look nice, but my set came without 1 backing. I tried e-mailing them but no response. So I had to go to Walmart to buy new backings.This experience tells me I need to shop for jewelry in person instead of on the internet.

11083,"They're okay. Would be cuter if the crystal drops were smaller. No complaints otherwise.

",3
11098,"Great packaging, and arrived very fast. As for the quality of the product it is very shiny and clean, but the only one thing that I didn't like was that the small grooves by the heart had some thing black in it, and that just marred the clean looked. But over all the design is pretty.
",3
11099,"I just got this ring today and I'd say it's 'okay.' It was definately not what I had expected, but it still is a cute ring. I loved the symbolism behind the ring, but I'd have to say it is MUCH MUCH MUCH smaller than what I expected it would be. It is very pretty but it should be made a bit bigger. You can barely see the intricate design. Overall, it's okay.
",3
11154,"I bought this ring for myself last year around Christmas time and bought a similar one for my sister as a gift. We both wore ours frequently (just about every day). At first, the band bent a little but I didn't mind. It fit my finger perfectly still and since I was wearing it on my thumb, I figured it would bend into a more oval shape.The other day, I was wearing the ring and I was washing my hands and I felt a little pain in my finger, almost like a pinching feeling. Of course I look down and the band is cracked in half and no longer wearable.I don't know what caused this ring to break since I always take it off when doing something that might damage my jewelry. I'd recommend this ring but only for casual/occasional wear.

11179,"It looked as though it was a mens ring and I purchased it for my husband. When I got the ring, I realized it was a ladies ring. Not at all what I expected. Disappointing. Please specify ladies or mens.

11357,"I had wanted this ring for a while because of its interesting look, and I finally got one recently. Well, I'm sending it back and exchanging for something else. While this ring is beautiful and large and fun, I didn't realize how much it would bother me wearing it. I was hoping for something I could wear every day, and this is definitely not an every day piece. It snags, it hinders my finger's mobility when I put it on due to its largeness, it kind of irritates me because some parts of it poke my skin, and it's soft metal. It reminds me of strings of solder or just really thin silver wire. I love Silver Insanity's products, but I don't like this ring enough to keep it.But thanks to Silver Insanity for letting me exchange and making it such an easy process.

11367,"Nice ring, but very fragile. Part of it broke the first time I used it.

11368,"It's a beautiful ring, but extremely uncomfortable to wear. Possibly if I had a little larger size it might make a difference. Not sure....
",3
11369,"The ring is very pretty, but the odd shape of it doesnt allow the ring to keep its shape. The ring was also about half a size too small for the size it was supposed to be.
",3
11371,"the product is nice, however the sizes are smaller than a ring of that size should be. Also the filigree tends to snag on clothing and other surfaces.
",3
11387,"Ring is very pretty. It is very very wide though. It makes it a bit unconfortable to wear. It is a very interesting conversation piece.
",3
11393,"I really would love to give it 5 stars. The only reason I am not is because I too have clumps and some of the design isn't as pretty as the picture. One of the clumps is a little pointy and it irritates my finger. I've just had to learn to ignore it and if I twist it just right it isn't that bad. I do this because I do love the ring. It sounds crazy to do all that, but I love it that much! I get compliments on it too. SO...I really want to give it 5 stars but can't because I feel I didn't get the ""best one"" in the bunch.
",3
11394,"Very pretty ring and I love the way it looks. The only issue I've had so far is that it is uncomfortable when you bend your fingers due to the wire design, there are many wavy points on the edges of the band that dig into your fingers when your fingers are bent. I will definitely wear this on special occasions but not for everyday wear.

11415,"Unique Filigree Wirework Wide Band Sterling Silver RingI ordered two of these, the first order was perfect, so perfect my granddaughter got it. The second was less, had some areas that would snag. Sizing was not a problem.Thank you

11419,"I took the advice of the other reviews and went up a size, but mine was still a little tight. I am still waiting for my exchange but I hope it comes soon, I loved the ring.The ring is beautiful and I got so many compliments on it.
",3
11421,"First, I *do* like this ring, however the rest of my review may sound. That being said, the first thing I noticed was that it's sized rather small. It's quite a snug fit, so I recommend ordering a size up from what you normally would order. The second thing I noticed was that it really doesn't look like the picture - the wire is much thicker than I was expecting and wasn't put together very well. I have to wear it *just so* so that you can't see the giant holes in the ""filigree"". The band is also quite wide, so some people (such as myself) might have trouble bending whatever finger they wear this ring on. Then today, as I was giving my finger a rest from wearing it, I noticed that IT TURNED MY FINGER GREEN! Sterling silver does NOT turn my fingers green. I could deal with wearing it a certain way and only for short periods of time, but turning my finger green? It's junk.

11429,"The length of the earspirals are a little shorter than expected but they are really pretty! when I got them and held them in my hands, THEN I appreciated just how special and unique they really are, but buyer beware that they can seem a little bit smaller than I anticipated; they are almost like a piece of wire that has been crafted and twisted into a unique shape. I suggest browsing their website [...] to get a more accurate idea of the length and their other unique earspiral varieties.

11441,"I shouldn't have bought these without size listing--they're lovely, but much smaller than they appeared on the pic.
",3
11442,"They are very nice and I have gotten compliments. However, I like to be able to put them in and forget about them but they catch hair and are too bulky to sleep in w/out waking you because they're digging in. It also says you can add your own beads but the contour of the spiral won't allow an elegant small one. You'd have to add a very large bead that would just be too much for the dainty look of the earring. So far they don't irritate my sensitive ears and that's a big plus! Overall, they're pretty and interesting but a bit expensive.

11485,"The unit is compact with a storage area for holding strainer basket and tweezers. Unlike the Jewel Jet, this unit uses distilled water only. When you turn on the steamer, you wait for the ""Ready"" light, and then press steam. The steam starts slow, then builds til the light goes out. Then about 10 seconds later, a real blast of steam and WATER comes shooting out. Unless you have their container underneath, you will have water running all over your counter. The unit has a cleaning bin which takes about 15 minutes to heat up.I think that this unit will provide clean jewelry. The steam blast does not appear to be as strong as the Jewel Jet, however if you follow the precleaning procedure first in their soaking bin, I think you will end up with as clean or cleaner jewelry than the Jewel Jet.Keep in mind that fatty substances on jewelry really need to be cleaned with a detergent first in order to ensure a thorough cleaning. We tried using steam only, and it did not turn out near as well as using the soaking bin and their powder detergent.

It's actually a silver base with gold painted over it, it seems like. I know this because the gold paint is peeling off of the top screw. Honestly, it doesn't bother me a whole lot, and it's not noticeable (kind of hoping it peels off and becomes just silver). Very cute, very comfortable, overall I'm happy!

Almost all pearls have lines/ridges across across them. Low/medium luster. Disappointed. Anyhow, I love pearls, so for the price it's still worth it, I think. I'm keeping it, and, given all the reviews, I may try my luck again sometime later.

Although when you look at it from less than two feet away, you start to notice the ridges and blemishes in it. I think that the clasp is absolutely terrible! It is almost impossible to use with fingernails and I could only imagine the difficulties that I would have if I was an elderly woman. I would recommend buying this for everyday wear and not for an event that you would really want to stand out at. I am keeping my set, and I would recommend these to anyone that wants a decent set of pearls at great price. I would not recommend these for anyone who is looking to knock some socks off.

I am very disappointed. I looked forward to wearing it too much. Now I'll need to find one that looks better. The other products I received from Sabrina Silver I'll rate much higher though.

11907,"I loved this ring, but had to send it back. The stone sat too high for my liking. It's definitely not an everyday ring. I wished Amazon or the vendor had provided a side view of the ring, plus the dimensions. That would have helped in deciding to buy the ring in the first place. It would have saved me money and the hassle of returning it. It has a beautiful setting and the stone itself was clear with a beautiful cut, which brought out the color of the smokey quartz.

I was actually kind of excited about it, because it seemed like something she would like a lot.Pros: It seems well made and has a nice clasp. It also arrived pretty quickly.Cons: The somewhat blurry picture gives you a different idea of the opal coloring. This is not a deal breaker for me. The opal is not ugly, just not nearly as subtle as it seems in the picture. However, the s-shaped pieces just look kind of weird in person. They're very flat and have weird bumps on them. Perhaps they're supposed to look like diamond chips? I have no idea.

The reason I only give this a 3-star rating is because one: for the price, I really expected more of the pendant itself. It is pretty thin and I thought there would be more weight in the silver. The second, the quality of the chain could have also been better. Again, for the price I was expecting better. I'm expecting to have to change the chain out for a more sturdy one in the near future.

For the price, I would have sent this back if it wasn't so close to Christmas.

12347,"This ring is attractive and feels good on the hand, but I have two problems with it. First, the description should state that the bands are hollow, not solid, 14k gold.

The chain is too short and the beads have a front and back side, and the whole thing is too light, so the necklace tends to bunch up and ""roll"" on my neck, exposing the underside, getting twisted and buckled and not hanging properly so it just ends up looking slovenly. Proper length and weight is very important with y-necklaces. I wish designers would realize this.

However, even if it does not fit my taste, it might be fair looking to some other buyers. I give it three stars due to the fact that I am not impressed by it.

They're pretty, but mine feel a little heavy and kind of droop forward unless I push the backing tightly against my earlobe (which hurts so I don't do it anymore.)If you don't have an issue with wearing the backings tightly against your lobe, then these are very pretty looking earrings. I don't wear them anymore because I think they look funny with the little saggy droop forward when what I would want from these earrings is to be more like large studs sitting straight in the piercing(honestly probably not noticeable to most - but I can't help but nitpick.) Again pushing the backing tightly against the back of your ear would also solve the problem but a more balanced earing (a backing with wider/more support) would have been ideal.

I rebent the longer one and was fairly successful--the wire is sturdy enough that the original bend spot still shows, but it's behind the ear. They're also larger than I thought they would be, but they seem to be overall well made and attractive.

13133,"thought these were very unusual so i bought them .when they came i was surprised at how long they were. i kept them because i do like different things, but would have been nice to know how long they were.
",3
13145,"A little smaller than I expectred for the price. Chain is very thin. Comes in nice box. Clarity could hve been better for price. Worth the sale price but not the full price.
",3
13148,"The chain broke on the first night I gave it to my wife. I sent it back and they gave me a full refund, but my wife is still giving me grief over the whole incident.
",3
13156,"The pendant looks much nicer than ones our friends purchased at local stores. There is a quality issue regarding how the pendant is attached to the chain. The pendant fell off the chain after my wife having worn it only 3 times. Fortunately we did not lose the pendant but now need to find a jeweler to repair what should not need repairing.
",3
13166,"Returned it... clasp did not work properly. But more importantly - the pendant was very small. Beautiful but small.
",3
13191,"I ordered this to wear on a necklace with other ""bootie type charms"" I have representing my 4 children. When I received it I realized that it was too small next to the others I have.It is very cute and would work wonderfully on a charm bracelet or on its own as a delicate necklace charm.
",3
13194,"i like the ring very much..just the right size. i had it for about 3 months, and wore most days. One day I looked down and saw that one of the emeralds had fallen out. I had expected the ring to last longer.
",3
13202,"Is cute. Haven't given it as much wear as would've liked. Simple, see, the nipple rings are blue, and though love the color, I've enough to color me in such a manner, and I kinda try having more than 1/3 of my rings a certain color at any one time.
",3
13203,"I am disappointed in this cord; normally Eve's Addiction is very reliable for good quality, but not this time. The clasp hardly seems secure--it's just a knot that slips through a little loop, and the color isn't the same shade as in the picture. Instead of the dark green I was expecting, I found the cord to be a light lime green. Like I said, surprised and disappointed at the normally-dependable Eve's Addiction.
",3
13246,"I bought this ring as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved the style of it, however, after awhile it started turning his finger green (even though it claims to be sterling silver). Also, the obsidian stone chipped and now there is a big chunk missing. The ring looks nice, but it should not be intended for everyday wear.
",3
13271,"It looks nice in the picture, but it's actually probably too large for casual wearing.
",3
13294,"The description is misleading - the earrings are much smaller than described. It should state that the leverback is part of the length. If I had known this I would not have purchased them. They're OK, but not great. I would think twice before buying jewelry again.
",3
13307,"I bought these as they can be worn with lot's of different colors and because I like drop earrings. I really like the quality of them and have gotten lots of compliments about them (I also bought the necklace that matches them). The only thing that keeps me from wearing them more than once or twice a month is the difficulty I have with getting them into my ears. I've never owned a pair of earrings that close the way these do previously. If you open the ""catch"" the angle to get the post into my ear is just awkward and takes me several minutes of fiddling with the position and pulling my earlobe every which way before I finally get the post all the way through. It's a bit annoying and while it's certainly a more secure way of attaching the earring compared to say a fishhook style, I find that I really dislike it. This is why I give them 3 stars versus a higher rating.
",3
13309,"pretty but small these were very hard to get on and or off maybe a teenager would be able to wear these i couldn't

13313,"It's way smaller than I expected. Beautiful color though. Taller ladies should be aware of the size of this pair of earrings.

13379,"The chain was smaller than I thought, and the Heart was bigger then I imagined..
",3
13380,"This is a nice silver necklace. The chain has an extension, otherwise would be too short for the heart pendant. The heart pendant is pretty and larger than 1"", but the silver is a lighter weight than what I normally wear.

13405,"Way to dark for me, I am just using them now with my winter colors. They are darker then the blue of the picture. I have had these for sometime now. Maybe I will get used to them??
",3
13406,"I just have to point out first that I purchased these as a gift for a friend. I was very unhappy with the packaging and that is the ultimate reason why we sent them back. You can't give these as a gift in the packaging they're sent in because the initial box is falling apart and then the jewelry box inside has an Amazon label on it, when taken off, it leaves a tear on the box that looks heinous. I'm going to upload a photo so you can see what I mean.If they're not going to be given as a gift, they are a very cute, petite little earrings. I wouldn't suggest earring them in your first earring hole, but maybe the second or if you have your cartilage pierced up top, they would look adorable up there.I expected them to be a little dark. I didn't have a problem with that- but for those that don't know, I wanted to point out that they're not as bright as the picture depicts. They do glisten beautifully under any light though.Thanks to Amazon for your great customer service- I received my refund very quickly after shipping these back.
",3
13410,"I ordered these earrings because I liked the light blue color in the several pictures on Amazon. I was expecting them to be a bit darker based on a few reviews. Theyre not BAD earrings if you were looking for DARK BLUE stones. Depending at what angle you look at them at and under what light, they look BLACK (someone else pointed this out) At best, they are a deep indigo, like DARK blue jeans. Thats not whats pictured! Since I was looking for something specific I wouldnt have bought these. Theyre not bad looking earings (although they do look smaller than whats on the model's ear photo) Just not what I was looking for.My biggest problem was packaging. Someone, in their infinite wisdom, stuck a label on the pretty blue box right under the bow. I tried and tried to carefully remove it but it was impossible because its a paper box. So I ended up RUINING the pretty box and Im now embarassed to give these to my wife in this box, so now I have to find ANOTHER box!!! THANKS KATARINA!!!!***12/21/11 UPDATE*** OK so a rep contacted me, without me having to contact them about the box issue and a new box was FEDEX'ed to me overnight. I ADDED a star to the review. Thank you! I see they changed the color of the earrings to more accurately represent the the actual colors.Once again, these look like nice earings, but I was looking for light blue stones which was shown on the age when I bought them.
",3
13417,"Pretty, but small. Like really small. Typical guy, I should have realized I wasn't getting gigantic rocks for 150ish bucks, but I didn't. Anyway. Like I said, pretty.
",3
13423,"I was initially disappointed with the size-they were not exactly as pictured and upon first inspection, seemed too small. But
",3
13430,"Speedy shipping. Blue diamond color with a slight green hue - very nice. Also, very small. Each earring probably is a quarter carat. The spare four-prong setting makes the diamonds look rather smallish. Great if you want very simple, unobtrusive earrings. Not so great if you were looking for something with more presence. If that's the case, probably best to head toward .50 carat per earring (of course, at an increased price). Now, the box. Thankfully, the presentation box is very nice. However, the outer box with Katrina on it and a bow would have been very nice as well . . . if someone in shipping had not plastered a tag over the top of the box and part of the ribbon. Taking off the identification tag ruined the look of the box (box came away along with tag), and part of the ribbon. What would have made for a nice combo presentation, now is pared down to the inside box. I'm comfortable giving three stars even with the ruined box. Fix the box, and the rating might get another star (since, I only paid for a quarter carat per earring, and the price was quite good).
",3
13438,"With this ring is only problem stone is too big. I expect something stylish and elegant. It is not it.
",3
13460,"The earrings were very lovely ad arrived in good condition and quickly. However, I was very disappointed to find that they did not clearly mark whether these were untouched real blue or irradiated blue. No did they include an actually assessment by a verified gemologist.Still, pleased with them; but wont know until i have pay for a local gem guy to look at then to know how pleased I really am.
",3
13464,"These are nice-looking earrings of unique design, but they are a bit flimsy, especially the wire hoops. Although they may be ""gold plated,"" they still leave my ears a bit sore at the end of the day -- I'm sensitive enough that gold, silver, or hypoallergenic hoops are the only things I can wear for several hours with complete comfort. Given the price once postage is added, they are quite a bit more expensive than other earrings I've bought on amazon that I like better. Still, I'll keep them as I like the design and they do look nice on.
",3
13482,"Pros: These earrings are very petite and pretty. They're highly polished so it sparkles in the light, and they're lightweight so you don't even feel them when they're on. They're in 14k gold, which is always a plus for me since all of my other jewelry is of that purity.Cons: They're EXTREMELY small. The listed 3.15 inches in the specs is actually the total length of the earrings when they're unfolded. The diameter of each tube is probably 1 mm. Also, the chain connecting the two tubes is very thin (much thinner than the tubes), where the first link starting from the tube is basically as thick as a strand of hair. Because it's so thin, it's easy to bend the link so the earrings look crooked. In fact, when I first pulled the earrings out of the box, they were already bent. Also, considering the amount of gold it has (.4 g), these earrings are pretty expensive.Overall, they're pretty, but I personally would not have purchased these if I had known their actual size. They'd be a good buy for a young teen but they seem too delicate for anyone older.
",3
13489,"I just recently bought this ring for the second time and I have to say I am very disappointed. The first time around I bought it for myself and I absolutely loved it. It was perfect. The sizing was amazing and it didn't turn my finger green. It was a great middle finger ring. I wore it all the time. I went out of town and ended up forgetting it at the hotel I was staying at. By the time I realized I wasn't wearing it, it was too late to go back and get it. I re-ordered it and I'm disappointed. The ring itself is a lot thinner than the first one I got. It seems like it could break at any moment. After wearing it for a day it already started turning my finger green and showing discoloring in the ring itself. Also, at the bottom of the ring there is a big clip in the band. Overall, I loved the ring the first time around but the second time I was very disappointed.
",3
13490,"I ordered six of these sets for a wedding I'm in next month. The are very pretty, but the sets did not come with matching chains. I was surprised because the set is entitled ""Earring and Necklace Set,"" not ""Earring and Pendant Set."" The picture shows the pendant on a silver chain, and the product description does not mention that a chain is not included.Looking back, I should have inquired to see if a chain was included. I recommend other buyers do the same if ordering similar sets.
",3
13491,"The silver scarab pendant I recieived does not have the darker coloration; it's entirely silver in color. I was also expecting it to be a bit weightier... the pendant is very, very lightweight. I was expecting a bit more rugged pendant. This scarab pendant would be nice for someone wanting a very lightweight, elegant pendant. It's a decent buy, and the shipping was fast.
",3
13502,"I bought them for my grandma's birthday. I received them in 3days. However, I noticed a pretty big black speck in one of the diamond stud. The other one is beautiful and sparkly. I was a little disappointed, but I know my grandma wouldn't mind it too much...
",3
13509,"A good value for what it is. My only complaint is that these earrings are tiny - the picture can be deceiving that way, and the label 1/4 carot helps in that deception because that is the combined size (each being only 1/8 carot) yet sounds ""big"" (not as bad though as rings that claim 1 carot but are really 100 stones of what I call diamond dust, combined to add up to 1 carot).
",3
13518,"These are extremely small, bought them as a xmas gift for my bf, he does not seem to mind them so................ But if they were for me, I would not have been satisfied.
",3
13528,"I think the earrings look good. They were smaller than I anticipated. I don't buy jewelry a lot. A close up picture next to something of known size would have helped me visualize how big the earrings were. For $99 it's a deal for me!
",3
13529,"I had decided to order this set of diamond stud earrings as a gift for my girlfriend in spite of reading a few reviews with negative comments. I knew that they would be small, which was okay because I thought they would be nice for everyday use, and my problem was not with the size but the quality of the diamonds. One earring had a small black spot along the outer edge of its diamond and the other earring had two large and easily visible white cloudy areas inside of its diamond. These defects were visible to the naked eye and I decided it was not worth the risk of any disappointment as a gift and so I returned them. I would not recommend the earrings as a gift but perhaps they are okay for personal use. They were quite sparkly despite their interior flaws.

It was smaller than I thought but I do have be honest and state that I did not pay attention to size in the description. The clasp needs to be better, but other than that, it looks real.
",3
13649,"This is a nice bracelet it's very shiny and so far pretty stable I've had it a couple of weeks and have never taken it off, but you do have to tighten the figure 8 clasp so that it has a secure grasp on the little bump. and that's why i gave it only 3 stars.

13663,"This bracelet is very stiff. Seems like it could break very easily. I'm a bit disappointed. Would like to get a refund but can't find the receipt.
",3
13665,"Starting with the positive. As someone who has very thin wrists, this is the perfect fit. I lost my ""real"" tennis bracelet due to a faulty clasp and got this to replace it and it's an exact match. However, on with the negative. I'm stuck in it! Have no fear of losing this one, once you fasten the clasp, it's not going anywhere. I've been trying for a half an hour, unsuccessfully, to get this off my wrist. I may be returning just because the clasp is SO bad. That is, if it doesn't break while trying to get it off my wrist. So....I don't know if I'd recommend, its a great bracelet, pretty, great short length but the clasp is beyond words! ruins the whole deal *edit* I have had three people in my office try to remove this from my wrist....still no luck! help!
",3
13677,"This bracelet is absolutely beautiful--much more brilliant and striking than I expected! However, the clasp is horrible. The clasp came undone and the bracelet slipped off my girlfriend's wrist (unfortunately in a busy public area...) the day I gave it to her. It really was tragic.However, it was such a beautiful bracelet for such a great price, I think I might order a replacement for her, and then try to figure out how to make the clasp more reliable.This product would definitely get 5 stars if the clasp were better.
",3
13678,"For $30 I guess you shouldn't expect too much and although it was nice looking when it arrived, after a few months of wear a link went bad and the clasp started having some issues (part of the clasp broke off). So at first people did think it was real but after it started going south it just looked like a piece of junk jewelry. Too cheap to bother getting it fixed, easier to just buy another.
",3
13682,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to worry about ""real"" jewelry at my wedding. It's a nice piece; however, one side of the clasp does not stay. I squeezed it a bit and it was better but it did not stay on all night ... after the pictures, I didn't care ... Still worth it for this type of wear. It would take minor adjustment to fix the clasp; however, we shouldn't have to fix something, no matter what the price.

13708,"I expected this product to be a little better than what it is (based on the picture). However, nothing special in it. It is quite small and not that eye-catching. But compared to the price I shouldn't have expected more than this.

I love hoops that are not too big yet show up and make me shine : )Amazon always comes thru.UPDATE Aug. 8th...I already lost 1 earring. No, I will not re purchase. Disappointed as they were pretty in the beginning. Just not well made I guess. : ( Back to searching for a great, small and well made hoop with sparkle.

13807,"The product arrived on time and looked great. Only one problem: it had been polished with some kind of material that left dark marks on my wife's clothing. I wasn't too pleased with that.
",3
13811,"Considering that it's sterling silver, the price certainly isn't bad. The details are nice, it's a pretty shape, but make sure you thoroughly clean off the mouthpiece before using, as the residue of the uncleaned silver tastes awful.Also, the opening of the holder (where you stick the cigarette in) seems a tad small for anything but cloves. A bit of a pain to have to twist regular cigarettes into it.

So I was searching to replace it. This ring's photo looks exactly like my ring. I was so excited, because I was missing this part of me that was just gone after 15 years. There are no specs to know the width, but the photo size looks just a little larger than my actual ring size, so I got this ring. This ring is beautiful, and simple and elegant. My problem is it just doesn't look as substantial as it's photo. I expected it to be wider, almost twice as wide as it is. I expected the wires to be thicker, I guess I just expected more. This ring is dainty compared to what I expected, so I rated it 3 stars, as it's okay. I do wear it, and would even say like it.

13855,"The pendant itself is just lovely, and I had great service from Silver Insanity. But...To reverse from onyx to Mother of Pearl, the stone actually rotates _within_ the framework of the pendant, rather than reversing simply by flipping the whole thing over. Really, it's a neat idea, but it doesn't work very well in practice. The stone rotates so freely that nearly any movement at all can set it to turning, and it often stops mid-flip, with neither onyx nor Mother of Pearl showing entirely. Instead, it's often the silver frame that shows, with a sliver of white and black on top and bottom. How unfortunate for an otherwise lovely necklace!Once I determine how best to stop the free spinning, I'll be very happy with it.
",3
13857,"the pendant is much smaller than I expected,because it's so small and thick, it's hard for it to stay on one side,it will roll over,I will recommend other people don't choose this one,instead of another rectangle one,also has black onyx and mother of pearl reversible pendant,I brought that piece one in turquoise and lapis,another is carnellian one,they are much more beautiful than this one,big and bold.

13929,"Initially, I bought one for my sister. My only issue was that I had to bring it to my jeweler to have a bail put on. Otherwise, loved it. Thought it was unique and functional. Rated it four stars.So, I bought one for myself. Before I could wear it the magnifying glass fell out and chipped. I probably should have returned it, but I went to an optician to see if I could get another magnifying glass. (I am waiting.) Realized when the glass fell out that the workmanship was poor (perhaps just on mine... ): The glass quality wasn't as good as others I have; the magnifying glass itself had horribly raggedly edges and hadn't been seated in the pendant well (not flush, for example). We'll see what happens when I bring it to my jeweler to have the glass replaced; I assume he'll glue it in. Too bad. It is a unique and attractive design. Had this not happened on the second pendant I bought, I'd have rated this pendant higher.
",3
13958,"This is a wonderful piece of jewelry. The intricacy is amazing and the silver work is very detailed. I am not giving this 5 stars because I was somewhat upset that this cost so much when it does not even come on a real chain and the fact that the pendant itself is extremely light! It does not feel like a quality piece of jewelry and for the price, I would have thought it would feel heavier and not so trinket like. I still really love it. But I think it should only cost about 30 dollars.
",3
13959,"The detailing is great, but it is very light....about the thickness of a dime. There's only enough silver behind the design to hold it into place & unevenly at that. The back is kinda lumpy, definitely not worth this kind of money. I agree with the previous reviewer, worth about $30.

13971,"Although I bought these earrings at an unbelivable low price--they were way to small for me. In the picture they look wider than they actually are. They are just a tad bigger than huggies and not as wide, so I sent them back. If you like prettty small earrings--these will be perfect for you. They shined very nicely.

The necklace is beautiful don't get me wrong, but I assumed the pink color of the necklace was a light pink like its shown here. It is however a dark pink and looks almost cheaply made rather then what is shown. Its still a beautiful necklace despite the bad picture here. Oh and one more thing... if you decide to have it gift wrapped it looks cool in its little box. But if you decide to have them write a message for you its horrible. Basically they have this big card that says For You on the outside and inside is your typed message really small and not even centered in the card. I was a bit disappointed by that seeing as how its a mother's day present. Luckily the box came to me before I gave it to my mom with its little cheap card.

14171,"Review of Spider nose cuff: Over all I liked the product.ProsGood detail on item (antique on finish makes it stand out).Made of silver as advertised.Shipped promptly by vendor.Price was right.ConsStem on unit was not thick enough kept bending would not hold its shape.Bead on tail should face the other way to help hold the unit in place.Finish on bead at end of cuff and stem of cuff was very rough (lots of casting residue), especially for something that goes on a sensitive area like the inside of a nose.

The diamonds look fake and strange, and I am really not at all impressed with it, My husband likes it, and I guess for the price I paid, I didn't get a bad deal, I was just not happy with the overall look of it, once it arrived, like I stated, it looks cheap. Maybe I should have known that the item name, being ""Good Looking men's Diamond Wedding Ring"", should have told me it was just a Good ring, nothing more.S

14282,"I bought this piece several months ago and have worn it several times, though I am not personally crazy about a ""lariat"" style of necklace. I would have liked it better if it were just a circular choker. In fact, I have decided to take it apart and make a choker using leather cording and the ""poppy"" shells.The only problem I have with it as a necklace is that some of the beading string can be seen in between two of the flowers. I would suggest using a permanent marker in either orange or red to color any part of the exposed string, (which looks dirty, btw...probably from string wax or something). Otherwise, it is rather lovely. The colors remind me of tangerines and blood oranges. It has an extender chain, so I imagine it should be able to fit any size neck.

But as my sister was wearing it the outer part of the ring turned black and the ring Tarnished just hours after getting it.

It arrived on time and looked like the picture but the size was too big and it was bent a little bit. Now after wearing it only a few days its whorped even more. Overall, this purchase was not the best, but I still wear it anyways even with the flaws.
",3
14495,"I really like the customer service, and the box it comes in is absolutely adorable...however, the ring is not at all what I expected. A little smaller than I expected, and the top...well, the little circle thing with the knot inside? Well, it juts out so far, that it reminds me of one of those Egyptian signet rings. I almost dipped it in wax to see if it would leave an imprint on an envelope! The design is great, except for the fact that the top juts out and I haven't gotten any compliments on it, except for my Mom's. Ah, I would not really recommend this ring, unless you wouldn't mind it looking like a signet ring. It is real silver, though, and very glossy and shiny, so I would give it a three star rating. Just my personal opinion.
",3
14498,"The ring looks like the picture but is very low quality. Of course, for the price I didn't expect anything high end or quality. It bends and dings easily, but for a cheap ring it's nothing more than I would expect.

14531,"These earrings are a little thin and more delicate than I expected. They will be fine for my ten-year-old daughter, for whom the earrings were purchased, but I was a little disappointed when I opened the box.

14533,"These earrings are adorable and the perfect size for a pre-teen. However, I was very surprised/disappointed at how very thin the gold is--almost like wire. They bend quite easily and so require careful handling which I don't think you can always count on from a child! I worry too that the thinness will significantly impact durability. Maybe they're counting on the kid losing them before they come apart.

",3
14573,"It seems like I had an unusually bad experience ordering this product. It shipped quickly, but the cheap little box the pendant and chain arrived in was completely smushed by Amazon's packaging. Also, ""flawless"" is a bit misleading. The pendant arrived with very visible dark tarnish stains on the front, instantly requiring cleaning/polishing before I can even gift it. I haven't tried to polish it yet, but to have jewelry arrive that's not ready to be given as a gift is a pain in the butt.

14578,"Why you may wonder I wrote this tittle, nice, well to tell you the truth I brought this chain to my girlfriend and she was pleased, indeed, sadly the chain has a mayor issue, its weak and can break in a hearthbeat, yes I still have the chain but as you may guess already it's broken.
",3
14579,"The heart pendant is good looking, very shiny and a good weight and from the reviews I've read the shine on the heart will stay. I was disappointed in the chain as the lobster clasp did not close all the way and it seemed a bit flimsy (also mentioned in some reviews). I've ordered a separate chain and if it works, then I'll use it for the heart to give as a special gift. If not, then I'll send all back. Not happy about ordering another chain, but the heart was just what I was looking for.

14591,"Wasn't sure what we were getting into buying this online and not really being able to see it. Thependant itself is very nice and while we may end up replacing the chain its ok as is. I didnot like the cheap packaging it came in, being a gift you would like a little more thana plastic bag and box.

14630,"When you see a product with all(but one) reviews giving it a perfect 5, you are forced to stop and think. The product and the price poses a challenge which I guess other sellers will find difficult to match.I gifted this to my girlfriend, and she was absolutely gaga over it! It has a sleek but solid chain, and the design is very delicate. Perfect for someone you love!A must have!!updated on 1/4/2010 - I had initially rated this at 5, but learnt that the shine and color had worn off after 6 months. I would still rate it as 4 if this is selling for $25, but at what it is priced now, thats not possible.updated on 3/26/2011 - The above update pertains to the chain and not the heart itself. The heart still retains its shine and look after so many months. But ouch!, the current price is almost 2.2x of what I paid when I bought it.updated on 2/15/2012 - Another V'day went by and the heart still shines like new. I would like to clarify that the snake chain lost the shine/ color and was probably caused by exposure to moisture in the air. When I got it, it was in the low 30s price range. I have watched this item over a long time and see that the price does fluctuate over time, and occasionally based on probably market dynamics, this item goes from high 70s/ low 80s price to the low 30s that i bought it at.

14643,"The Sterling Silver Floating Heart is very nice and looks wounderful. The chain has begun to blacken. Don't know much about sterling silver, but would have thought that the chain would not blacken if it was the same quality as the heart. Another chain of better quality could be purchased to remedy this problem hopefully.

14665,"Note: The rating is based off what it was needed it for. We do not know how this product works in an ear.We need something to hide a septum piercing, but nothing other than the usual staples or posts was able to be found. This sort of works in the nose okay, but is still fairly visible. Pops in and out super easy so it was lost in a tissue. Work requirements demand something like this rather than a standard septum retainer, and until something better is made this does good enough for now.

14703,"I buy everything by this author and have noticed that she is an excellent crocheter as well as knitter. My first impression of this book was poor but then on looking into the patterns for each bag, I began to see some very innovative designs. I can't use most of the yarns called for (Lion) and also can't felt on my side loading washing machine and this rules out quite a few of the bags. But her techniques are worth exploring perhaps in other projects then the ones in this book. Several use Tunisian crochet. Instead of lining she calls for plastic canvas mesh. She gives instruction for twisted cord on several of the handles. The dancing diamonds felted tote is made with a double-ended hook. Magic miters felted tote is the nicest one (bottom left on front). I also like the pink evening bag on the bottom right. Of all the crocheted bag books this is definitely the most unusual.

They didn't look nearly as big in the picture as they are and was very surprised when we got them and they were bigger than a silver dollar (product description does not include dimensions). Mom still liked them and plans on wearing them during the playoffs for as long as the Packers keep winning. Personally I think they are too big and should be about half this size, but Mom likes them. The quality of the material is good and they look just like the cheese head hats. They are light weight and good color. If you're planning on making a bold Big statement, then these are perfect. If you are just looking for cute cheese head earrings, they may be too big.

HOWEVER, hubby is a mechanic and even though takes it off while working, just having oil and dirt, etc on his hand has caused the color to start to fade, and the ring is taking on a tarnished look, as well as some scratches from him doing PT.

Nice enough for the money but you couldn't wear it every day.

15009,"Hey everyone, these earrings are not as good as I hoped they would be. They'e a unique design but the pair I received had scratches all over them and are slightly bent. I am not sure if it was due to rough handling before the seller sent them off or if all products from the manufacturer are made that way (so in saying that, quality is not fantastic). The CZ are shiny and sparkle in the ""right"" light. They are not worth $27+ perhaps I would have preferred to pay around $15 for the quality that I received.

15011,"This ring is fine - the size fit me perfectly. It's very light weight (which I like), and it fits well (size 11 really is size 11).

15201,"These earrings were not what I expected. I'm going to have to learn not to purchase earrings online as I tend to love the pictures of them but not the jewelry when I get it. They are pretty but way too big for me. They are much too heavy and I would never find them comfortable. They are constructred fairly well although the back level that goes through the ear is a little too short. I have a friend that may like them, so I kept them and will send them to her. I also paid only $5 for them butd it cost me almost that much in postage. I certainly do not want to have to pay postage to send them back. If you are looking for a large, heavy earring then you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for smaller more petite earrings, do not purchase these.

",3
15227,"Thought I'd found the perfect piece until after we put it together. Assembly: At least 3 people are required to put this together. For example. It takes 2 people to hold heavy pieces in place while a 3rd lies on the floor underneath to screw hinges in place. However, the instructions are clear, especially if you've done your own assembly on this type of product before. We had no trouble following the directions and they provide appropriate cautions along the way. You just need extra help.Finish: The color is dark/yellow ivory (no where close to white). It has a ""distressed"" finish that looks like 3 rollers were drug down/across all the pieces - parallel lines without any randomness. In places the exposed wood is one inch wide. Sauder is sorry I'm disappointed. They explained the finish is a paper laminate. It will not hold paint. If I decide to paint it I will void the warranty on the finish. Unlike other Sauder products we have enjoyed over the years it just plain looks cheap. Had I seen this in a store I never would have bought it.Use: The casters on the leg (installed properly) would not roll when I tried to open it. I had to lift the very heavy fold down section and hold it up while reaching far back underneath to grasp the leg to extend the pull out shelf and the lift up table. First time I opened it the table overextended in the process. Now there is a large gap on the work surface between the two pieces. We worked hard (following the directions) to make sure there was no gap when putting it together. But I could not open it without creating a gap. The screw holes for the hinges are now probably stripped because there's no other way to get at that leg. There's no handle - no hand holds - nothing to assist. You just go for it. Maybe I should have used 2 people. I had trouble closing it by myself when first assembled. I didn't really take note it required 2 of us to close it. I guess it takes two to open and close. Also - the leg is in the way when you sit to work at it.The gap on the work surface is sure to be a problem. Stuff WILL fall through or get caught. It will be uncomfortable to use seated due to the position of the leg. In the long run I may just decide to sell it and buy something else. It would be a nightmare to disassemble and return. I no longer have the packing and it came in two large heavy boxes. Its heavy. Its sturdy. But the quality of the finish and the difficulty opening and closing it should be considered before you buy this.I had high hopes but in the end I'm just plain disappointed.
",3
15234,"The set is quite pretty and very well made; but I am unable to give it 5 stars because the only claim it has to being a set is the stone cut and setting similarity. Ie: the pendant stone color is the lovely dark amethyst purple shown in the picture, and the earrings are so much lighter in color that, if not for the same cut of the stone and settings, they wouldn't even look like a set at all. For the $19.99 price I got them at as a Gold Box deal, I guess I shouldn't complain; but the difference between the pendant stone and earring stones is VERY noticeable. Bottom line; I'm quite happy with the pendant - but not with the earrings; which I should also remark on as having some of the longest posts I have ever seen.

15270,"I did not initially have an issue with my order. I ordered 2 toe rings, the first being a lady bug and fit fine, the second being the small heart. The band was way too small and definitely a size difference from the other toe ring from the same company. I emailed the seller and got a response and answered their questions. I was then told that they would look through the stock and send another one. A week went by and I never heard anything so I contacted the seller again via email. I got a response, again quickly, stating that the toe ring was sent the week. My original order took 4 business days to get here. This had been over 7 from that email. I never received a replacement and I cannot wear the original one. You can see a large size difference from the lady bug to the heart. It is upsetting that I cannot wear the toe ring. I thought that the company would have emailed tracking information or something. I do not see how I got the original package without any problems and the ""replacement"" never came.

The 8mm size was also too wide for my liking. My wife also did not like it and I returned it. Amazon was very accommodating and accepted the ring back and refunded my money.
",3
15359,"This is a nice ring. However, I work with someone who used to work in the Jewelry industry and the only company that has the rights to making black titanium is a company called Merrell. We got the ring a little later than expected, but still came the day before I needed it give it as a gift. Also, the ring itself is kind of sharp. Meaning the seems where the black and silver meet, is literally sharp. We thought we might cut our ringer on it. Overall, it's a pretty ring, but I prefer the real version of it. Not the one made in China.

",3
15454,"I loved this necklace when I saw it online and even more when I got it for Christmas. It's unusual and pretty and felt special. On Christmas I unclasped it and looked at the globe. 2 weeks later I realized I hadn't really looked at it closely and did the same. Then I spent a half hour trying to get the clasp to shut. Eventually I got it and it held for several hours but I'm pretty much just waiting for it to open. It just doesn't seem able to fasten securely. Time will tell. But I love it a lot less now that I'm not sure if it will break any minute and after only 2 weeks!Even though I like it I'm not sure I would have bought it if I'd known it would break or better yet I just wouldn't have opened the clasp.
",3
15462,"I absolutely love these earrings but they are not worth $39.99, I was expecting a longer stick on each end and a little thicker. These are very light, good for your ears but it makes them swing too much. I bought a similar pair at a mall jewelry store, sterling silver, longer sticks for $12.00 but with a swarovski crystal on one end. I really liked the idea of a stick on each end but I was expecting a little more bulk. These are almost invisible when you're wearing them unless you get up close.

15471,"As mentioned these are fairly small. I thought I would like to try them because they are different. I don't see many earrings you thread through your ear. As mentioned they are extremely light-weight and would be good for those wanting some length but no weight. They are very delicate, and bit too much so for me. I like bolder earrings because I'm very tall. I also have long hair and this could create a problem. I like them and will keep them. Good for hair pulled back or short. Very well packed.
",3

15485,"If only one of these necklaces is worn, it makes for pretty and fun look. Warning: it will tangle on itself VERY easily so be careful when handling it. I wore one on a sweater and it stayed put probably because it stuck to the sweater. It's too bad they can't be worn together as displayed because this is the look I wanted. The shamrocks are plastic and are held together by a dark cord. Would I recommend these to friend? Nope!

16027,"I ordered this ring and it was here within 3 days. It was very fast shipping and I was happy with the company. I opened the ring and it was very beautiful, but it was alot bigger than it appeared in the pictures.

",3
16103,"It is a very nice piece of jewlery. Gets many compliments. However it is much smaller in person then the picture would lead you to believe. The chain is very thin and the clasp is cheap. I can't imagine anyone would have a photo small enough to fit in this locket. It was a gift for my wife and she is planning to purchase a thicker chain with a better clasp.
",3
16110,"It is not what you will call high end looking...but then again the price reflects it. The pendant itself is actually very charming but the chain makes the whole thing appear cheap. I actually found an old chain that is has a much more elegant appearance and replaced the original...now i get compliments on it all the time.
",3
16125,"Like many of the other customer reviews, I agree that the ""crystals"" are not much more than plastic. The picture is also misleading because the beads look like they are dangling off the earrings, free to move around. However, this is not the case; the beads are completely stationary and do not move at all. The only way they could move is if you manually turn/twist the beads around the single post that goes through them.Although the beads and the aesthetic design are lacking, the lever-back metal quality is very good. Putting the earrings on is simple, and the lever is very secure and strong. I don't feel as if the lever-back mechanism will break or wear down anytime soon. It is also designed so that it would be very difficult to lose the beads or separate the dangling part from the earring. It is great for me because I wear out my earrings pretty easily, and these earrings feel very strong and secure--not easy to break or fall apart. In the end, I feel that it is barely worth the sale price, but definitely would not be worth the full price.

16181,"Nice earrings, but the colors aren't as distinctive as they are in the photo. The blue is quite pale and doesn't stand out against the orchid and clear stones.

16236,"I was expecting a cluster of crystals that were individually dangling to maximize movement. They hung straight down from a center post. They sparkle and look good- but I expected much more after I read all of the reviews for them. I would not pay full price for these, but I paid $18.99, and feel slightly ripped off. I'm beginning to think that most of the reviews are fake, since this is my fourth purchase from Gem Avenue.

16261,"My husband bought these earrings for me because they were on my wish list, they are nice and a nice size, however the metal is very tarnished. I would like to think that when items are being packed for shipping that someone is giving them the once over, I guess that is not the case. Needless to say, we will be returning them.
",3
16289,"If I purchase another silver ring, I'd purchase one that is comfort fit, or at the very least doesn't have sharp edges. It's not worth it.
",3
16292,"For the price, I certainly expected more when it arrived. There was no ""WOW"" factor when I opened it up. They will be okay for everyday wear but they do not meet my expectations for the amount of money I spent. Had I seen them in the store, they would have stayed in the store. The grey is almost completely clear and the black is not that dark either so it is if you have a slightly charcoal grey with clear beads. Not sure what pair they took the picture of but they are not what arrived at my house.

16309,"These earrings are pretty, but seem to be plastic. I'm not convinced that they are Swarovski crystals. But for the price they are nice and work well with black and white clothes.

16324,"The description is misleading - the earrings are much smaller than described. It should state that the leverback is part of the length. If I had known this I would not have purchased them. They're OK, but not great. I would think twice before buying jewelry here again.

16345,"Bought it for an adult. Cross is too small but the necklace was worth keeping even for $30. Necklace is gold filled, not gold plated and that is a big plus. The color is a perfect match for 14K and it should be since it is gold filled. Great length for a cross or pendant and it is a pretty chain. I needed something strong that isn't going to break and lose a real 14k cross but didn't want to pay a fortune for a chain. This was so much better than any 14k gold chain I was looking for and again for $30 it was better to keep the chain and use it for the cross I already have now. This cross is too small, I will give it to my little girl and put it on a small chain she already has. So giving it a three stars for the great necklace.

They are light-weight and comfortable, but I was disappointed to find that the front of the hoop tends to tilt forward, exposing the hinge and part of the post.

16492,"I was after a two-tone gold and silver chain, and the picture was just what I wanted. However, when you wear the necklace, the silver overwhelms the gold, and it appears that you a wearing just a silver chain. However, the quality is excellent, and the chain has a good weight to it when you wear it. I should have bought the 3mm chain instead of the 4 mm, as you might see the gold better against a smaller silver link.

The photo must be at least 5x larger than actuality. Other than that, they're pretty, but way too small. I was buying these for my grandmother, but had to rush to get her something else once I received these. I will definitely be more careful when buying jewelry online!

16601,"I bought these earrings thinking they would be the same size as a normal wedding band. But they ended up being too ""fat"" and too small in diameter. The quality is good though, and the packaging and box were impecable.

16607,"I got it wrong! Despite my,I thought, correct sizing, these ear rings are about half the size I wanted. They are very nice, but very small, more the size of a dime than quarter. I was trying to replace a set I'd gotten at Amazon and loved. Now I'll need to try again. Measure twice, cut once!
",3
16610,"There's nothing wrong with the quality of these earrings. They are well-made and arrived nicely packaged. But they are very small. Just a bit larger than 1/2"". And I misread the measurements thinking the were 7/8"" rather than .7 which is a big difference.One thing that I found misleading and may have contributed to my error is the pricing. There are similar earrings at 50% of the price these go for. So it makes sense if you expect pricing to be proportional and don't take other factors into account. For example these earrings may be heavier and larger and perhaps the price of gold makes even small differences large in terms of pricing.But bottom line: pretty as these earrings are they appear small and flimsy -- like something you'd buy at a super discount store. I'd rather buy a nice, substantive pair of earrings made by a quality costume jewelry brand like Kenneth Jay Lane. But to each their own.These are going back :(

16613,"It is hard to tell from the photograph, but the white areas are holes (diamond-shaped, thus the ""diamond cut"" description).Amazon isn't really misrepresenting this item, but the actual item isn't quite as attractive looking as the photo originally looked to me (against the white background, I was thinking the white diamonds were glare, and not holes).We'll see how the Mrs. likes it come Christmas.

Now here are my thoughts on the price and the actual worthynes? I found that you get what you pay for with these, the size is 2mm and altough like I said these aerrings are nice they are thin and look like what you paid for, I paid $89 dollars and they look like $89 dollar gold earrings so I cannot say I got a bargain or that this was a great deal because I think it's not they are priced on what they really are and I do not see myself paying anymore for these that what I paid for them, if anyhting I think they should cost $75 dollars. Again they are nice, they shut tight and are classy looking polished etc, and a good find since hoops like these do cost more elsewhere but again to me they look exactly what I paid for them they look like $89 dollar earrings so no bargain here adequately priced they are. I do recommend them though anything with more body then I would look to 3mm thickness.I'm a male so I needed an earring one actually that since I have long hair when I tied my hair in a ponytail the earring would not overpower and stick out like a sorethumb, these do look cool enough hair down or tied back in a pony tail, looking back now I would possibly would have liked a 3mm thickness but never the less I' still happy with my purchase.

(And it is sometimes difficult to picture the dimensions accurately) So, if you are going to get these earrings please make sure that they are the right size for you. The clasps are not great in quality. They seem like they will bend very easily and even break if not handled gently. Overall, I would not buy these earrings for $60. And I think $35 is a fair price for them.

I returned these earrings because I thought theywere a bit Pricey. I found Similar earrings at a better price at KidsFineJewelry.com which had a huge selection of these hooped earrings. Amazon did take these earrings back with no problem or questions at all which is what I love about the Amazon Experience.

However, it is very difficult to close the clasp because it is very thin and flimsy.. it feels that if I am not very careful, the loops will bend. Somewhat disappointed in this regard, but not surprised given the price. Also, someone else mentioned in their review that they were difficult to clasp.

I believe that the first time I wore it was the last time because somehow the clasp became loose and when I realised this it was too late because I lost one side of the earring. I looked for it but couldn't find it. Very disappointed that I didn't get to enjoy it.

I have another pair of sterling silver hoops that have this same type of latch. I've worn them for years, and they've never fallen out of my ears.

More for toddlers and very young children.

When my mom opened the gift, she said it reminded her of little girl earrings (NOT GOOD!).. but she wore them anyways. She has sensitive ears and says that it has not caused her any irritation and she likes that it has a very secure clasp. I suggest getting the thicker hoops so they don't look so childish. Also, the earrings were uneven. Where the clasp is, one needle was longer and bent down farther than the other. Very light in weight, hard to believe that its 100% gold. We'll see how long it lasts! Save your money and the embarrassment and go to a real jeweler. (3 stars cuz my mom's sensitive ears are safe in these)

Probably because they resemble owl eggs.At this price I don't expect diamonds and rubies, but I do expect the earring to stay securely on the ear.

17243,"** Before I even start of, I want to say that I did not buy these earrings and I am not reviewing how the product looks & feels.. **I never understand how gold is priced here in US.. Back in India we always pay for gold based on the actual weight of gold in the jewelery. I always find gold jewelery overpriced here..Take the example of these earrings. They weigh 4 grams and it is 14k gold.So the actual weight of gold is 4* (14/24) ~ 2.334 gm . The remaining 1.666 gms is usually made of metals like copper which are practically worthless.Price of gold today ~ 37$So, the price of gold in these earrings ~ 86.4$Taking into consideration the design and charges for making the earrings let us add another 50$. If it is a huge necklace with intricate designs may be cost of making will be high, but these are simple earrings. Still the total is under 150$. So, what I wanted to say is I think these are totally overpriced. I don't even understand how the actual price is shown as 808.00$ and after 558$ discount we still have to pay 250$.All in all, I liked the design of these earrings but I will not pay 250$ for them.

17332,"My husband bought the Duragold white gold chain for me at Christmas, to replace a chain that always got caught in my hair and then ultimately broke when I tried to un-entangle it! This 1.0mm chain is very dainty, more so than I thought it would be after viewing it online. I wasn't sure it would be sufficient for a three-stone pendant, but it's done just fine, without the pendant flipping around when I turn my head.At first, it didn't seem to get caught in my hair as much as the other one, but with my fine hair, I am constantly pulling it out of the chain. It usually breaks, so the hairs get stuck and wrapped around the chain. I tried burning it off, but that blackens the chain and I'm now trying to get those marks removed. These delicate rope chains with small openings are always going to get caught up in fine, long hair, but I think it would be better with a thicker chain.Most of the time I can get it clasped without a mirror. I do leave it on 24/7 (I take it off for a massage, dying my hair, stuff like that) and it has held up fine, so it's sturdier than I expected as well. Because it's dainty I was worried it would break with ongoing wear, but it doesn't seem like it will, and I've caught it with a comb a few times. The clasp doesn't end up in front any more than any other necklace, which could be another concern with a lightweight chain.I would like to see this chain offered in a 2.0mm size, as I would have preferred something with a little more thickness, but it really looks lovely with my pendant and is a great value. Beautiful white gold color as well. If you have fine, long hair, though, I'd look for a different style of chain so it's not always ripping your hair out!

I tried to put it on her myself and found it so small that even though I could see it clearly it was hard to get it to open and join it with the loop. I will get her a new chain but it will be hard because the loop on the heart is so small that it can only handle a very thin chain which also meens a small clasp.

17497,"LOOK AT UPDATE 1/17/2010 BELOW:LOOK AT UPDATE 1/17/2010 BELOW:NOTE: I only tried the SRT2 version, not the SRT3.HOW I FOUND IT (eBay):I had heart palpitations and high blood pressure, and thought it was caused by parasites (upon reading about them). So I looked on eBay and found a formula sold by [seller]. I looked for other things he sold, and found he sold the qlink. I was skeptical about all the claims, SO I LOOKED HERE ON AMAZON and read all the reviews. Lies by the sellers? Could be. Legitimate? Perhaps.PERSONAL FINDINGS:So I wanted to try it and see for myself. At first, it seemed to feel good for my heart wearing it, esp when sleeping, where the device stroked next to my heart. But I understand there's personal placebo effects. So I took it off to see what happens. I did feel a difference, but I conclude it's placebo. I tried it again and took it off again.... it's so hard to tell between placebo and not.WHY I THINK IT'S A SCAM:Unfortunately, such items can easily exploit the placebo effects, and claim that it works. How do we really know it's not placebo or not?For one thing, the device disobeys electronic conventions. There is no battery, the circuits are not connected, and there looks like a isolated resistor in the middle that does nothing. They claim it uses quantum technology, but if that's true, how would we know?Well, since it claimed that it stopped EMFs, I tried to do a test the best way I know how. I placed it next to a WiFi access point and tried to see if it made the laptop reception worse. It didn't at all.I understand that some qlinks come with an EMF instrument. I never got it, and I don't know if it works.Anyhow, since I didn't know what else to test, I wanted to return it after months of trying it on.Long story short, I tried to return it, but seller never refunded the qlink and the feedback period closed on me, so I couldn't leave bad feedback.See that's the problem with such devices.... you test it out to see if it really works, but it takes like a month, in addition, you have school/work, so your mind is on other things, then the feedback gets closed. I think that's why [seller] and others have such a high feedback. Some people get fooled, and because [seller] is so nice, they leave a nice feedback. But when others try to return it, the feedback time gets closed on them after they try to test it.CONCLUSION:I feel it doesn't work. Did I mess something? Perhaps, but more likely not. If you think I missed something, then please reply back and tell me. I'm very open but I don't want to be deceived and others to be deceived while the deceivers make millions.If you are unsure about this device, but after reading my review, still want to try it out, MAKE SURE YOU ORDER through ebay, and have a way to TEST it within like a week. If nothing happens, THEN RETURN IT and in 3 days or so report negative feedback, if they don't refund. BE STRICT or else you'll end up like me.UPDATE 1/17/2010:Recently, I took Electromagnetism in university physics, and found that current is ACTUALLY induced in a coil when the coil is rotated around in an magnetic field. This is FACT, and you can look it up. It's how electric generators produce electricity!So I decided to buy another qlink to give it a second chance. Eh, still didn't feel a difference, even after several months. But after going through the physics course, and after a bunch of negative ratings on my review, I've decided to write this update and change my ratings to 3 stars instead of 1 on all my reviews.In general, I don't like myself and others being deceived, and I HATE SCAMS and scammers getting rich, and so that's why I wrote the negative review to have buyers beware. (I gave a ONE star to balance out the POSSIBLY deceptive reviews).BUT if qlink ACTUALLY does help people, then qlink company should do a better job to PROVE to users that it works by allowing them to see things for themselves, rather than trying to convince us that it works. For example, I like the EMF finder device sold with the qlink on ebay. Also, qlink company SHOULD recommend ways to *prove* this device works... if feeling improvements doesn't reveal anything, like myself. Another way is for qlink company to find some stress test to perform and have the users feel the difference w/ and w/o the device. I know no best stress test to test.I am being honest, and if people don't value honesty in this world, then screw the world.-NVS

17590,"If you're looking for high quality that's durable, anti-tarnish and giftable--something worth passing on to loved ones as a family heirloom, perhaps-- keep looking. I would not give this as a gift, as I'm not real confident it will hold up for too very long, but for myself, it'll suffice--for now. At least one compartment arrived slightly but visibly warped, another, rather difficult to open. The necklace hooks are rather skimpish and more suitable for smaller pieces--not much good for '06 styles which are more generous in size. I'm not disappointed because I didn't expect a whole lot for $45 so at least I won't be crushed if anything happens to this on my trips, which is what I'll reserve this for--although, it doesn't hold quite as much as I expected, certainly not adequate room for my earrings.

The setting of the ring will cover up the next row of rings, so you have to offset each ring you put in a row ! Cuts the ring storage space in half. Most right hand rings are NOT solitaire settings and cluster gemstone rings are a particular nightmare to store in this....and the chain storage is basically worthless. You have to wind chains around each other so they won't hang down & you can close the case. If this is a 3 star product... It is just barely...

Not easy....Otherwise the front will fall open and well, that just won't work....I had a few extra pieces of jewelry that I don't wear that often that I needed to have a place to store.

17631,"...now I like it well enough.When I received this necklace a few weeks ago, I didn't know whether or not to be disappointed in the cubes. They are black, but look rather flat. By this I mean the color is matte; I have yet to determine what material from which they are made. Maybe some sort of plastic blend? The corners on some of the cubes are chipped. Ultimately, I decided the cubes looked well enough.The round beads are medium-dark gray glass and are translucent. They appear to have a pewter center.Small spacer beads are in between each round and square bead; they are shiny, and there is one of each of a light gray, a black, and an metallic navy color. The beads are strung on three thin wires.I wore this a few times, and it actually looks flattering with black, green and red casual clothes. I don't think I would wear this with anything excessively pretty or with a more expensive dress. I have received a couple of compliments on it...and I can say, I've never seen anyone wearing a necklace similar to this one.Approximate sizes -The cube is almost 1/2 inch on one side; the length is about 21"" from one end to the other.

Even though the letters circumscribing the pentagram are a latin transliteration of the hebrew word for Yahweh (YHWH) - It should be ""TeTRAgrammaton"" and not ""TeTRAIgrammaton"".

You could tell it was not cheaply made. However, I have had it now for a month, and I am now very upset by it. It has not turned my skin green, but it surely has changed colors itself. It has gotten all dark and dirty-looking in color. And the chain has oxidized too; it is like a dirty bronze color. If I could upload a picture of what it looks like now, I would. I have cleaned it thoroughly in liquid tarnish cleaner twice in the past month, which only seemed to help about 70% each time, but it has quickly gotten all tarnished again. I am really bummed out. I loved this when it first arrived; now I am a bit embarrassed to wear it. Even though we Buddhists are supposed to accept that everything will grow old, sick and die, and that we should probably apply this acceptance to inanimate objects as well, I'm still bummed out.

17677,"The photo of the piece is not very accurate. The true color of the inner part of the Ankh is dull gold while the outer lines are silver. The blue crystal is also not as bright, and is actually a sort of dark blue.Wasn't very happy when I received the package, as I was expecting a purely silver piece. The overall make of the item isn't bad, though I wish they would lay off the brightness/contrast when cleaning up their item photos.
",3
17680,"Overall, the ring is really nice. It looks great. Had no problems with delivery. Still waiting for the return to be credited to my credit card. And they did not credit me but for only half the shipping costs. Their reasoning was because I picked the wrong size, they are responsible for only half....It was their fault with the size.I'm not happy that the ring sizes do not match with what I received. A jeweler sized my finger and I ordered that size. It was two sizes too big. Because of this Amazon said that could not refund the full shipping cost since it was my mistake. (This occurred after I already received the new size, which is still too big.) I'm a 10.5, should have went for the 9 or 9.5, but I didn't want to go through the hassle. BTW, this will be my wedding band.
",3
17704,"I thought this ring was beautiful, so my husband bought it for me. It came in a gold box without any instructions. I pulled the tag off and the little piece of twine and ended up with a three day mess. We read directions and watched video. Finally, my husband's uncle, Bobby Attaway, put it back together. I am having it sodered asap. I don't need jewelry puzzles to keep me occupied. I am a youth minister's wife, I have a six year old, and I teach middle school. I have enough puzzles a day. My jewelry should be attractive and simple. I do love my ring.
",3
17710,"Loved it when it arrived. Very pretty, size fit perfectly. But the first time I took it off and plunked it down on the ring stand it popped apart. Never to be reassembled. I've had friends and family all try to put it back together. Very sad.
",3
17716,"I love this ring, but bought it without realizing it's a puzzle. I had to get my boyfriend (who loves puzzles) to put it together for me, then he used a hot glue gun to keep it together, temporarily. I suppose it's not the company's fault, I just wish I'd read the reviews of it before I purchased it, instead of after. Just be aware that this ring comes apart and will do so every time you take it off.
",3
17717,"This was a gift and is a lovely ring. Without thinking, I cut the thread holding it together, but managed to get another on there before it came apart. That thread lasted about two months, and now it is apart in my jewelry box, waiting for me to try the solution another reviewer posted. I hope it works!
",3
17734,"Now we see why the maker is called Silver Insanity. We bought the ring and it came today - it was beautiful. I took the rope binding the ring off and it came apart nearly instantly. We have been working on putting it back together for 3 hours. There is no answer key with the ring, and apparently no key on the web. The maker will not take it back if it has been separated. So if anyone knows how to put the dang thing back together, please email dunnhorn@yahoo.com

17765,"This necklace is MUCH smaller than it looks. I don't have a particularly thick neck, but it fastens around mine like a choker, making the last two beads stand straight up.If you are a petite woman with a thin, delicate neck, I think this necklace would look beautiful on you. If you are average or plus sized, stay away.
",3
17784,"I bought these earings recently at what seemed to be a great price for them. When I redceived them, I realised why they were so inexpensive. They are &quot;extremely&quot; small. The clarity is fine in the stone, but that can be generally expected in a semi-precious stone. Honestly these earings are better for a small girl who recently pierced her ears. They are just too small for adults. Noone would ever know you had them on.
",3
17787,"The most redeeming quality of these earrings is the 14K gold setting that appeared to be quite strong. Even at the sale price of $29.99 less 30%, the value just wasn't there. The stones were much smaller than one might expect. My stones did not have the color and clarity the picture would suggest. They aren't visible enough to accent the purple outfit I was planning to wear with them. I'm afraid they must go back.
",3
17788,"The earring were really pretty, well made, and nicely packaged, and they came quite quickly. I will be returning them, however because they are too tiny to even see on your ears. Perhaps they would work for someone with multiple earrings or a baby.

17912,"I bought this ring for my girlfriend and she likes it a lot but she realized that the pearl is fake! It failed the tooth scratch test and it looks like shiny paint or some shiny thin layer is being scratched off the surface. If it is real its been sprayed with something to make it shinnier.

17913,"The dragonfly pin was just as expected, and the delivery was prompt.However, please note the following:1. The pin is packaged in a flimsy paper box with ""Made in China"" on it. So you will need to re-package it as a gift.2. The flimsy paper box was mailed in a standard business envelope (8.5 x 11), so it was completely squashed. I really expected the pin to be broken, but it wasn't.3. Overall, the product was just like the picture, but it would have been nice if they took more care in packaging. I read several other reviews (after receiving the pin) about the company that stated similar experiences.

17940,"There are no measurements in the description and I thought this was going to be a longer necklace. It's more like a choker than the long one I was hoping it would be. But still very pretty. Please add the measurements Amazon.
",3
17942,"The advertisement is deceiving. One line states between 6-7mm, and another states 5.5-7mm. The stones are definately a 5.5. or smaller. That is no problem as long as you are expecting that. I was hoping for some larger pearls and did not get them. The color and brillance are pretty though as long as you have a magnifying glass!
",3
17946,"Amazon sent an ad for longer drop-earrings, which would have been too ostentatious for my neighbor's twelve-year-old daughter, so I looked around and found these in a more appropriate length.I was a little disappointed when I began reading the reviews; some buyers were satisfied, some not. Since peridot is Amy's birthstone and the picture so appealing, I decided to take a chance.When they arrived, there were some things I liked about them, some things not, but I'm still giving them to her because I figure she's young and they will serve adequately as ""starter"" earrings. Like most of us, she'll probably lose or break one before too long anyway. So what the heck! Meanwhile, she'll get some enjoyment from them.The peridot chips are a nice size and, actually, quite lovely--a popular shade of green that's uniform throughout the stones--but the pearls leave much to be desired. As other reviewers noted, the pearls have flaws and are NOT round as the picture depicts. I think I ""hit"" and ""missed"" on this product because, though flawed, at least both pearls are flawed in the same way, giving them a uniform appearance.If you're not seeking perfection in these earrings and consider them to be a ""fresh and fun way to wear pearls,"" then I can recommend them. I would definitely not recommend them for a discerning woman, but for pre-teen or teen girls who are seeking their first adult jewelry, it's a good way to start.I think Amy will see the beauty in the colors and style, thus delighting in this gift, so I'm not returning them. I'll know for sure in August when her birthday rolls around.Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008author of: The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley

17950,"I bought these for my sister for her birthday with the accompanying bracelet. Both are very nice looking pieces of costume type jewelry. Not lavish but cute. The earrings are not put together well. Within an hour of putting them on, she lost the pearl out of one earring. It just fell off. We found it eventually and put it back on but now she's too scared to wear them again.
",3
17952,"If you're looking for perfection in these earrings, then these arent for you. From a distant, these looked good enough and satisfied me enough to keep; nice green color with pearls, can't really go wrong.Unlike the picture where it shows SMOOTH oblong pearls, mine had lines horizontally around each pearl, so because the lines were on BOTH earrings, they were uniform in imperfection. Also, from a distant, it's not noticeable. The size is just right, not small that it goes unnoticed, but not big and gaudy either. Nice weight, won't weigh down your lobes.However, I also purchased these in the amethyst, but the amethyst were terrible. The purple colored looked bleach in spots and the pearls on those were so bug-like and fake with terrible lines right down it, that it looked like plastic. I ended up returning those.So I can definitely see that these can be a hit or miss.I liked these though: affordable, nice color combination, nice size and unique.
",3
17953,"If you don't expect round pearls and don't care that your pearls have these icky looking threads running around the middle of it, then these will do if you want pearl and peridot earrings. I like the color and really debated whether to return them or not because of the crappy pearl, but hey hopefully no one will be fascinated by the lovely color contrast and want to get a closer look. I'm never buying another pearl jewelry from Amazon because of these pearl earrings though.
",3
17959,"The product arrived quickly and was packaged well. Pleased with the over all order process. The chain is a very bright silver, doesn't match the pewter pendant. The chain is also much to small and feminine for a male to wear this necklace. I Had to go out and buy a new chain in order for my boyfriend to be able to wear the pendant. The pendant is very nice though, seems good quality.
",3
17960,"I love the look of this Mjolnir pendant and wore it everyday for over a year. However I had the pendant on a metal chain and over time the chain ate away at the pewter loop on the back of the pendent until it eventually broke off. So now I'm in the market for a new pendant. If you've got to have this particular one I would recommend using a cord necklace instead of a metal chain.
",3
17964,"I got these to use in diamond earring jackets. The price is very good. I looked at trying to get these separately and found buying them that way was cost prohibitive. So I found these. I need real gold for my sensitive ears, and the 10K gold does the job without the extra expensive and fragile nature of 14K. But some of the stones are so pale that they all look alike. Even with that happening, it is probably a good deal to buy these for the other colors, which look great in my earring jackets. But some, like the aquamarine, was impossible to distinquish from some of the other pale stones that were also almost colorless. I gave it three stars because that is about the percentage of earrings that I would be using. The others will be be set aside to use if I lose my diamonds and feel like a pale imitation.
",3
17965,"Apatite is supposed to be a pretty blue/green color as in this picture. When I received the earrings, I was disappointed with the color. The color is actually a pale blue. They could be mistaken for aquamarines or blue topaz. I like the design of the earrings enough that I'm keeping them even though the color is not what it should be.
",3
17985,"This is a very pretty ring but my hands are rather small. It looked like costume jewelry on my hands so I returned the ring.
",3
18004,"They're not bad (at least not for the sale price). The stones are fairly sizeable and, as for color, they sort of disappear in my brunette hair. Some people might find that disappointing, but I think it's kinda neat, and they've become a favorite pair.Would've been four star but I dropped a star due to the leverback latches being pretty lousy. On one of the earrings, it's out of alignment and won't snap firmly over the hook. It either ends up beside it, or a few millimeters open. I don't think I'm going to lose the earring because of it, and it certainly doesn't show, but it demonstrates a lack of quality.
",3
18005,"I was a little dissapointed about the colour of the stone,it's much lighter than the picture,but they look nice and are wearable
",3
18007,"I received the earrings promptly. They look just as the picture shows them. The stone itself is a decent size and the clasp is actually quite pretty, but slightly weak. Just don't sleep in them. I find that the stone blends in with my hair too easy, so I only wear them with my hair up.The reason I give them 3 stars is because the gold turns my ear black which means shoddy material. I expect that not to happen at that price.
",3
18008,"These earrings were a disappointment, especially considering how much they cost. It's too bad too because the stones are actually quite nice: good size, nice color, well cut. But they are set in such cheap findings, they make the earrings appear chintzy. I would pass on these.

18017,"I purchased this 10k ring in lieu of the 14k with plans to have the stone re-mounted in a more solid ring setting by my jeweler. The setting is actually nice (wish I had purchased the 14k.)The stone is the problem - it is not cut properly. One end of the stone is angled down into the ring which ruins the nice rectangular/oblong look of the ring.Quality control must have had the day off when this ring was made.I also have the matching earrings & necklace which I love (I placed the pendant on a heavier chain)

18042,"I searched for short sterling silver chains for my daughters (ages 7 & 9) and was pleased to find these. They are sturdy, priced affordingly and just the right length, but the spring ring clasps on both chains (I bought two) are faulty. They open fine but don't close unless you push them closed, so I must assist my girls every time they wish to wear their necklaces. Too bad, because it was difficult to find chains appropriately sized for young girls.
",3
18043,"I am disappointed in the clasp on this chain. The chain is lovely but the clasp doesn't close properly. I should have taken a review I read to heart. I ordered two but will definitely find better ones locally. Since it is a child's chain the clasp should be strong.

18070,"the hooks are reasonably sturdy, the beads are gorgeous, but the stick section is pitifully weak--sterling is way too soft a metal to depend on such a thin wire. The earrings came out of the bag bent in several places, and will likely get bent just by normal wear. I""m keeping them, because I ordered them to get my order over the $75.00 free shipping limit. Otherwise, back they'd go.

I *thought* this guy was gold-plated, but it made me a little itchy, so maybe it's not?? However, it is adorable without being cartoonish and I really like the simplicity and the weight of it. It's also considered good luck to have a elephant with its trunk raised! If you don't have metal sensitivity then go ahead and get it -- it's a great price for something that is hard to find.

Both are 3/4 of an inch high with the height of the ring on top and they are 1 inch high. Because they overlap you'll need spacer beads or something else between charms if you want more then one on the same chain (one for each of your kids for instance.) I went to Hobby Lobby and picked up some glass beads to space them out. Worked out well.Good choice if you want to honor your kids but don't want to spend $300 or more on the Kidz charms.

I recieved the ring which is beautiful but it is 1 full size TOO BIG! I used the amazon ring sizing guide which is a link directly on the page for this product. I contacted the vendor and they stated the ring sizer for AMAZON is wrong. Im in the process of having to return the ring to get the correct size, however upon reading the return policy and wrong size ring policy it ready about paying a fee plus shipping to get the correct size. Im not sure if Im going to have to pay a ""fee"" yet as I havent gone through the process but if I do have to thats just wrong! Apparently the vendor has told amazon repeatedly that their sizer is incorrect but yey it remains on the page for the product.So do yourself a favor and DO NOT USE AMAZONS RING SIZER!!If I do have to pay a fee I think it should be AMAZONS responsibility to pay this and not the mis informed customer.I will post back once I get more info from the vendor.Also you can not have this resized yourself as it is a 2 piece ring.

18834,"it was a nice ring, and i was psyched on the idea of a steel ring, but i feel like the undersides of the bands should have been smoothed out more and maybe it would have rolled a little easier on my finger. but the color was unexpected and nice.

18844,"First off, it's a light blue or light turquoise stone, not a bright blue stone like in the picture so I was kind of disappointed. Pretty, but not what you see in the image. Secondly, there is very little color contrast between the gold-toned side pieces and the rest of the ring in silver. Being that the ring is much smaller than what you see in the picture, the gold really doesn't show up much. So in essence, it looks like a silver ring, not two-tone.That being said, it's a nice ring. Well-made and pretty and true to size. I have been wearing it fairly often.

18849,"Got this ring today. The color is NOT the deep blue shown. More of a very light blue and the cut on the stone does not show it to its best advantage. You see a large flat area at the center of the stone so there is very little ""sparkle"" and ""fire"". The setting is nice but the lack of a deep blue colored, well cut stone keeps this ring from being a 5.
",3
18863,"I REALLY LIKED THE PICTURE,THE HANDS WERE PRNOUNCED AND HEART STOOD OUT-SAID 1/2"" WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD SIZE,QUITE DISSAPOINTED WHEN i GOT IT,IT IS VERY SMALL,MORE LIKE FOR A 10YR. OLD,HANDS ARE BARELY NOTICEABLE AND RING SEEMS LACKING FROM WHAT I EXPECTED,SORRY.
",3
18876,"i purchased this bracelet because i liked the two tone colors and thought it would look nice with some of my clothes for work. i like the bracelet alot and it has alot of shine and is very pretty but i find that the clasp isnt as sturdy as it should be and it falls off easily. Other than that i really like it.
",3
18879,"This is a beautiful ring, but wearing it is another matter. It should have been smooth on the back side, instead it is the same all the way around and is very uncomfortable to wear. I tried to wear it, but gave up and now it sits in the drawer. Too bad!
",3
18883,"Best sort of gift for someone who loves things -- and not the typical hat & mittens set or earrings!
",3
18892,"I was surprised to see the size of these earrings, they are so light you have to touch your ears on occasion to make sure they're still on. They have a habit of not hanging correctly. The design is nice but it's almost too small to see.
",3
18893,"I was not as pleased with these earrings as I was with the matching pendant because they were so very small. Still they are very pretty earrings and my wife was pleased with them.....
",3
18914,"This was shipped quickly, so that was good. I feel like it's a bit expensive for the quality. It is very pretty, however, it's obvious it's just pretty paper attached to the box. The ballerina is pretty, although, mine did not twirl correctly when I got it so I'm returning it. I'm going to attempt to physically shop for my next jewelry box.
",3
18916,"I was somewhat disappointed with the jewelry box. The music box itself was terrible. You couldnt tell what song it was playing, just noise. I had to replace the music box itself with an old music box that was in my jewlery box when I was a little girl. The Fairy Jewelry Box was a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday and I didnt have time to send it back.
",3
18930,"My grand daughter loved this at first sight. It seems to be very durable. She is only 16 months old and has no trouble opening and playing it for hours.
",3
18939,"Beautiful box design. I was so excited to get this for my little girl. However when I spun the music handle it didn't work correctly. The music does not sound accurate and the ballerina barely moves. Disappointing!
",3
18953,"My daughter loved it but it soon fell apart. She was only 2 when I bought this for her and after about 3 months the doll fell off & the box began to peel. If you do buy this make sure your child is not too young and will be more gentle with it.
",3
18955,"This is a cute jewelry box for a little girl. The quality isn't top notch (I think the inside of the one I bought is coming out a little and I've only opened the box once)but it's good enough my little flower girl. I really didn't want a shiny jewelry box but the fairy ballerina was the decision maker for me.
",3
18967,"The cross and necklace is more fragile than expected, but for the money it is a good value. My daughter was pleased with the gift.
",3
18984,"I have been very happy with Silver Insanity's jewelry in previous purchases but I wasn't impressed with this pendant and it is not worth the price I paid for it, with shipping was over $60. The cage opens side to side, not top to bottom and it gives it an oblong oval appearance. The stars and moon crescents are only on the front and the silver cage is very thin. The overall size is nice at 18mm. I do not recommend buying this.
",3
18991,"This sweater guard has beautiful clips, but one clip is already beginning to weaken and fall off when I use it. It's also way over-priced. The free magnetic bracelet is a joke (so ugly). Also the chain is way too long for this to be used as a sweater guard. What I am planning to do is to shorten the chin and replace the clips which are only glued to the outer attractive clips so that I am able to continue using it. It's a beautiful piece, but disappointing for the amount of money I spent for it.
",3
18993,"very nice, chain is a bit long, would like it shorter very preetu, nice accessory for dressing up & going out
",3
19021,"We really like the shape, size, and style of this ring, and how shiny it was--at first. I've been wearing it for less than a month, and it already has numerous notable scratches all over it. We were not expecting it to be so easily damaged at this level of gold count.

19025,"It was a lot smaller than I expected.

19045,"It was a lot smaller than I expected.
",3
19048,"I ordered the pendant with trepidation since I like to be able to ""see"" what I buy. The picture convinced me to purchase it however. It was boxed very well; shipped immediately BUT the pendant was almost colorless. It was MUCH paler than shown and the chain on which it is pictured is not the one I received though it was acceptable. I am pleased but more clarification would have been appreciated.
",3
19052,"I am very happy with product. great product for the price.It was quickly delivered, the package was great
",3
19056,"The necklace was nice but for the money I think it should have been delivered in a nicer package. I received it in a little plastic bag. This was for a present and I had to go out and get a nice box for the necklace. I also excepted it to be sparkly but it was dull.
",3
19078,"Like it. Arrived in good shape. I more of the type to throw my earrings in a bowl. But the product is a good product.
",3
19110,"I really like this product. But I was unimpressed when I opened the box to find the stand broken off from the holder. The item is currently being fixed by a friend, So I have not gotten to use it yet. However, I do recommend the item.
",3
19129,"These earrings are really cute, but I thought that they'd be bigger in size.. When I got them, I was really disappointed. They are really small.. :/ But they're still cute.. Not much of an attention grabber.
",3
19141,"I didn't realize at the time of purchase that the size of this necklace is so small. I ended up saving it for a present to a small child. It is pretty, just not what I had wanted.Ordering and shipping was fine.
",3
19161,"This is my own fault but I didn't realize the female symbol is upside down so it doesn't make much sense when I wear it. Not sure if people will even understand what it's supposed to be or they might think it's an ankh which is obviously not what I was going for.It's not as 3d looking in real life either. When you are wearing it and view it from straight on you can only see the light pink which is more opaque than the image made me think it would be.Other than that the quality is what you would expect for cheap jewelry. Not a piece I would suggest wearing for more than a day straight for fear of skin irritation. I don't hate it but I don't love it like I was hoping I would.
",3
19162,"Smaller than I thought it would be but my little grand daughter loved it so all is well!
",3
19178,"I got it cause it looked cool. When it is loose it does not sit right.
",3
19185,"I have had this earring holder for over a year now, but it will soon be heading off to the church rummage sale.I thought it looked ideal, until I realized that whenever an earring fell or was knocked off it's space on the one of the racks, that it was almost impossible to pick up again from the floor of the holder. The rows are very close together, and you basically need a tweezer to retrieve any fallen earrings -- my average-sized fingers can't even come close.
",3
19189,"I have this sitting on top of the 7 drawer acrylic unit. Together they look amazing and the display of my jewelry is wonderful. However, as someone else noted, it is NOT easy to attach the earrings to holders. I have to use hemostats to hold them into place and if I drop part or all of it I then have to fish it out, thankfully the hemostats are long. There is one other very disappointing problem...the door is hinged by tiny screws on either end. After a month of very little use, the door is now falling off because the one side is split where the screw was driven into it. I should have returned it instantly but I was so excited about getting it and loading my earrings into it that I thought I could live with the problem.
",3
19200,"For the price, it's a pretty good gift along with some earrings. Hard to fish out earrings if they fall below the racks.
",3
19217,"It was a nice necklace. Well made. It was a bit too short for me. It is very shiny. I did return the necklace because it was a bit too small. I had my refund in 3 weeks. Nice company. I would buy from them again.
",3
19231,"It is very cute box, but it came broken, one of the little drawers didn,t come out, so I had to replace it. It was for a gift, good thing I check before give...
",3
19250,"It's a pretty tiny globe. I mean its nice if you, like me, specifically wanted a globe necklace, but its pretty tiny and a bit too pricey. It ended up being almost [...] bucks. Too much. Really expensive shipping too, especially for such a small. I bought a DVD at the same time, and paid double in shipping for this little necklace. Maybe try a different one?
",3
19269,"This is a neat holder except that you can't put smaller hoops on it because they won't ""wrap"" around the plastic.
",3
19284,"The earrings are very nice however I was looking for smaller earrings for the top of my ear. The picture was very small and no size of any of the earrings was given so I was left to guess as to the size. It turns out they are all waaay too big for what I was looking for and I feel stuck with them because it will cost me more money to return them.
",3
19295,"Though these earrings look fantastic when in, they feel sort of cheap and flimsy and are difficult to put on and take off without bending.
",3
19303,"It will serve the purpose. Not as nice as I thought it would be.
",3
19311,"These compartments are fantastic for jewerly storage. My only issue is the price. For those of you looking for a bargain don t buy here. I found the exact items at Bed Bath and Beyond, priced from 6.99-9.99. Needless to say I was really pissed off. I did not return because I had unpacked and already placed my jewerly away. However, I purchased four other compartments and I paid 9.99/ea. at BBB.
",3
19322,"As far as costume jewlery goes, this is a fun piece. I always take my rings off when washing hands or putting lotions on to avoid destroying any metals (see previous review). I like the interchangeable bands. Fits true to size.
",3
19339,"This ring is very true to the Georgia Bulldog logo.However, if you are looking for a more attractive, artistic ring that would be great for fans of bulldogs in general (including bulldog mascot fans of any kind), I recommend checking out the ring selection at [...]He has animal rings of several kinds - all available in sterling silver.
",3
19353,"I bought this for my husband as a present. He wears it often and does like it, but if you open the hinges too far they pop all the way open (hyper-extend) and are very difficult to pop back.

19371,"Am only collecting these for the butterfly theme I am going for . Love the color though . yada yada
",3
19376,"Its a nice necklace, it was really knotted up on arival as the other reviewer stated, so I wasn't surprised. The stones hang a little off-center, but doubled it looks ok. Stones are beautiful though.
",3
19382,"THE RING IN THE PICTURE IS THE RING THAT I ORDERED BUT IT IS NOT THE RING I RECEIVED. THE ONE IN THE PICTURE HAS A TURQUOISE BEAR ON IT WITH A SILVER HEARTLINE THROUGH IT. THE ONE I RECEIVED HAS AN INSET BEAR WTIH BLACK BACKGROUND AND A BEAR PAW ON IT.
",3
19388,"I bought this for my niece for Christmas and I felt bad cause it hardly opened big enough for her wrist - I thought it would break. It ended up fitting fine, but it is just an ok product.
",3
19391,"The ring actually looks nice, but the picture is a little misleading. The whole back of the ring is hollow. Overall, the ring weighs about as much as a ring that you would get in a quarter machine. I can't see how the price can be anywhere over 200 dollars. I'm considering returning this.
",3
19396,"its ok, the the skulls and crossbones are smallllll and the bracelet is so petit, pretty but too delicate for a bracelet
",3
19408,"I'd like to say first of all that I have bought from Dan's Jewelers multiple times and I am a huge fan of their work and craftsmanship. And really, I have no problem with the craftsmanship here. The pendant is well-made, cool looking, and the cord is reliable. My only grief with this particular item is that it's so damn small and it absolutely looks terrible being so little. There's a lot of detail in this necklace and I think that the pendant should be much larger to show that detail.
",3
19410,"These look nice, however I had to send them back the first time because they were scratched. When I received the second pair, one of the clasps was damaged. I was able to fix it so it was usable since at that point I needed a nice pair of earrings for my wedding rehearsal dinner and did not have time to send them back AGAIN! The company did offer to replace them again. I will definitely look elsewhere next time.
",3
19419,"These earrings are decent. I was not overly impressed with them, but I have worn them a few times and am fairly satisfied with their appearance from a reasonable distance. The silver looks handworked, which I like, and the red glass is pretty, but altogether I was still not overcome with pleasure when I emptied the fabric bag containing them.
",3
19425,"This is an okay pendant. The stone is rather small. It might help to look at pendant size measurements if given, before buying. Yet I must say that it is a classy shape and I often end up wearing this over T-shirts for a casual look.

19430,"The ring actually looks nice, but the picture is a little misleading. The whole back of the ring is hollow. Overall, the ring weighs about as much as a ring that you would get in a quarter machine. I can't see how the price can be anywhere over 200 dollars. I'm considering returning this.
",3
19449,"After recieving the product 3 and a half weeks later, I found the 1/2 inch pendant was ridiculously tiny for the price. Like ""tiny"" for a charm bracelet ""tiny"". However, I contacted the seller who immediately exchanged my purchase for a larger version at no additional charge. The pendant I recieved was the 3/4 inch and it is proportionate to what a pendant size in relation to a chain should look like. I'm much happier with the 3/4 inch pendant and it looks good with my 3.0 mm 24 inch chain! In other words, unless you are giving the 1/2 inch size to a baby, small child, or as a charm for a bracelet, don't bother ordering this. Shipping takes a very long time but customer service was top notch and the end product was worth the wait.

19476,"I love this ring and have been wearing one for almost a decade, this is the thrid one i've purchased, all drom different vendors. So when my last one broke i was pretty thrilled to find another one so easily. But i have to say that the dealer hasn't been very responsive. Just two days after getting the ring the liquid started to drip out, and now it's completely dry. I've emailed Carolyn but she never responded about replacing this defective product.

19638,"I found this ring to be a little disappointing in person. The quality is good, and the weight is OK, but not as heavy as a solid S/S ring due to the spinner! I noticed right away that the area behind the Greek Key design is not black (as depicted in the picture,) but rather a light matte gray. It is funny, but I took a quick shot of it with my ""Photo Booth"" camera built into my MacBook Pro, to include as an attachment, but alas it too looks darker in this shot than it does in person. Shipping was quick, customer service is pretty responsive. Overall, a happy purchase, I'll keep it and am wearing it as I type this review.

",3
19671,"The color of the stones is really pretty but the earrings aren't very well made. The posts that hold the stone are different sizes on each earring, one sits down farther on the stone than the other. You can really notice it, but for the price I'm not going to replace them. I just hope my friend doesn't notice since they're a gift for her.

",3
19692,"I bought this for my then 5 month old daughter when she lost her existing earrings. The earrings are of good quality. It was easy to put the earrings in her ear. It is also the correct size for her small face. It does not overextend at the back, so it does not poke her even when she lies down. The only downside is that the thread is tiny, so she may not be able to wear any other earring if the hole in her ear closes to the tiny dimensions of this thread. I would have bought the bigger size if the product information and photographs were clearer. Hence the 3 stars.

However, it took some time to bend open the small rings just to make them fit onto my regular-sized men's fingers. Only a child or small lady could have gotten the ring on otherwise. Looks good, but the glitter came off a little bit in some places as I struggled to make the ring fit.

19732,"I ordered these earrings for my sister for her birthday. I had read another review that said the posts were on the top of the earring, but I double checked the images and they clearly show the posts being in the center of the stone. This is important because if the post is at the top of the stone the earrings sit too low on your ear and they look weird. Sure enough, when I asked my sister about the location of the posts (she lives in another state, so I haven't seen them personally) she said that they were on the top of the setting. Needless to say, I'm upset. Obviously, the images are supposed to be an accurate depiction of what you are buying!!! I feel deceived. That being said, she did say that stones are very clear and pretty and that she doesn't mind the posts being on top as she has long ear lobes (she could have been saying that so she didn't hurt my feelings). Anyway, be forewarned the posts are on the top of the setting, not in the center.

19801,"I purchased these as a gift for my boyfriends mom. I am really disappointed in the packaging. They came in a small box with some filler and the earrings themselves are in a very cheap little bag. I was expecting something I could just wrap up. Now I need to search out something to make it a presentable gift. The earrings themselves are nice enough, seem a little on the cheap side for the posts. I guess you get what you pay for, $40 worth anyway. The color of the stones is very nice. I wouldn't recommend this item to a friend. I am keeping them because they do match a necklace I got her for Christmas last year.
",3
19804,"I have no complaints about the quality of the setting, gold is very high right now so the fact that you can get these for less than 50 bucks is pretty impressive, and the setting is very nice and solid. The color of the stones in mine though, well...they were very very light purple. It wasn't my cup of tea, I was hoping for a darker purple, a more saturated color, but if you like pastel purple, then you'll love these. The cut and clairty was good, and the size was nice, I just wish they had been a little darker since I'm very fair skinned- being too light just means they disappear on me. My teenage daughter loves them though, and she's worn them on a few special occasions. I'd certainly rec. these earrings for anyone looking for a nice gift, especially for a teenager or young woman. They're comfortable to wear and look clean and sophisticated- great for casual wear or when you want just a little bit of color.

19815,"I purchased these earrings since I needed a pair of smoky-quartz earrings. When I received them I was disappointed with the size. I think these types of products should be shown in their true size rather than magnifying them to look larger than they actually are. These earring are okay, but if I had seen these in a store I would not have bought them.

19843,"These are not as pictured. I objected to the color (a shade of blue that I am not familiar with) because they will not match with any of my traditional blue topaz jewelry, nor will they match the blue topaz I have already purchased for gifts. Hard to tell what kind of stone these earrings are based on the color. However, perfect size for studs with a nice setting. Sadly, for my purposes, these can't be ""keepers.""

(This is a rhetorical question: All babies pretty much still come from the same place).Who can remember back to the day they first heard the name ""Paris Hilton""? It could not have been more than two years ago.I remember well the headlines about the various R-rated escapades of Paris Hilton. At first, I thought: The AP writers really ought to check their stylebooks, because they are anthropomorphizing the Hilton hotel in Paris, France. Then, I finally saw a picture of said Paris Hilton and found out that it was not at all the hotel, but the teenaged miscreant Tochter of the owners of the aforementioned hotel chain.Yet, two years later, more skeptical people are still asking the question: ""What has Paris Hilton actually *done*, besides being born into a rich family and behaving in the fashion of an irresponsible tramp?""Well, now we have found out what she has done: She has lent her name to a line of tacky products that are just as gaudy and bereft of taste as the Celine Dion licensed merchandise.Paris Hilton is living proof that being born rich does not necessarily mean that taste rides on the coattails of wealth.

Still likenecklace and I know how to get rid of tarnish. But must admit I was a little disappointed that necklace tarnished.
",3
19994,"I can work w/this. Iv order several chains from Amazon last year, only to be disappointed almost everytime. At lease I can work w/ this.
",3
20011,"I bought this for a gift, but its so small I'm kind of embarrased to give it. When its closed, its only the size of my hand. Looks ok otherwise.
",3
20012,"This works rather well for my needs, though there are a few ways in which it seems cheaply made. The tassels seem to come apart (and the stuffing comes out of them) very easily, and happened not only on mine but on the one I gave as a gift. If you intend to give one as a gift, make sure that you sew some reinforcing stitches on the end of the tassels to keep them closed. I also had to move the ""button"" to which the ring-holder loops, so that the ring holder would be pulled snug and not loose as a wet noodle.Otherwise, the fact that this is silky and has multiple compartments makes it suitable for holding jewelry.
",3
20046,"the item was not as luxurious as I expected. The ring roll is almost flat. The strings must go around too many times.
",3
20053,"The jewelry roll is very pretty. My problem is that this was the best out of what was offered. My ideal would have clear pockets so you don't have to look through each pocket to see what's in it. I do think that the Ring holder is a unique feature. However, I feel it is just an over-priced item that could probably be bought at any flea market or chinatown.
",3
20184,"These are nice, small earrings, but they don't look quite as nice as shown. The stones I got had more green in them and they lacked the black marks. As a result, I would probably think they were enamel and not real turquoise if I saw them on someone (though I have no reason to think that they are actually fake). Also, the stone is only on one side.Like I said, they're still nice earrings. The person I gave them to still loved them and I don't regret buying them.
",3
20216,"I loved this ring when I first saw it. I should have listened when i read other reviews. The gaps between the stones are large and noticeable. The ring size is not true; I wear a size 7 so that was what I ordered when i should have gone up to a size 8. If you have small hands this is not the ring for you, trust me. Get yourself a band that is 2 or 3mm no biggger. I have already started looking for a better fitting wedding band. As my title stated this is a pretty ring but it does have it's flaws.
",3
20220,"I bought this as my wedding ring. While at first it was beautiful, after wearing it for a month or so, the actual ring was no longer straight around. It had actually bent slightly. So when placing it on a table, it didn't lay flat. Which is weird because I just type all day. Plus, it was hard to see any sparkle in the ""stones"" because of the backing on them. I'm going to purchase another ring for a replacement.
",3
20225,"This ring is very beautiful and I have received compliments about it. However, it does look different than it appears on the site. Only the person who wears it often will begin to recognize some things about. The first interesting thing is that the band is quite thick. This is neither a positive or a negative, just interesting. The second thing I noticed is that there are little gaps between the stones. For the price I paid, I cannot complain, but I do sometimes rotate my ring so that the section with the least gaps is on top. The best thing is that it has not tarnished.
",3
20346,"it has great style but it gets caught on stuff and then it will bend out of shape. it is pretty easy to bend back but it won't last long.
",3
20350,"Its a pretty ring, it looks excatly like the picture. It is really easy to bend. I let my friend see it and she accidently bent the ring. I was able to bend it back into shape. thats the only problem with it.
",3
20351,"The Swiss Blue stones are pretty, clear and sparkly. But lighter blue than pictured. I would consider them a little darker than Sky Blue Topaz, but not quite Swiss Blue Topaz. A shade lighter than Swiss Blue is the best description. The setting is nice, just not sure if I'm going to return it. I bought it as a gift for my step daughter to wear to a wedding she is a bridesmaid in. Her gown is Caribbean Blue. Swiss Blue is a perfect match for that color. If the color of the stone were a ""true"" Swiss Blue, I would definitely keep it. I'm just so disappointed it is not the color blue pictured. Great price though for the quality of the item.
",3
20386,"The product came quickly. The humidor is pretty solidly made. the accessories that comes attached does not fully fit with the fittings and comes off very easily. However, the accessories themselves are descent and does its job.
",3
20394,"This is a great, trendy looking ring. The only drawback is that is fits very snug and is quite uncomfortable. I suggest ordering the next size up for comfort & correct fit. Otherwise, when you remove it at the end of the day, you'll have the imprint of the ring on your finger for several hours.I do get great compliments on this ring as it is very stylish and eye catching. I just wish it were a little more comfortable.
",3
20407,"I bought this item partially based on the 5 star review. I would say that there is no way that a person would mistake this ring as being real, near or far. It looks like inexpensive costume jewellery. Also the edges are really really sharp and when I do wear it catches on things and cuts me with the corners.
",3
20409,"This bracelet seemed a little long for me and was actually a little more than 7"" - I need a 7"" bracelet tops. It was very pretty and the width of the link was great. I was sorry to send it back but the company was very good about giving me a credit. If you like a 7 1/4"" bracelet, you may like this one.
",3
20411,"I bought this charm bracelet and found that the shells are very small, much smaller than I imagined from the photo. I wear it with another charm bracelet and it is fine.
",3
20419,"It was beautiful and difficult to discern from the real thing. After some time, the cz emerald accumulated scratches and lost its lustre. If there was a way to restore it by buffing out the scratches and making it reflective again, that would be wonderful. As it is, it's an alright buy--it is silver and only $40, but I would've liked to see the stone hold out a bit longer for that price.
",3
20432,"It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture. But within a couple of days I could start to see that it was getting scratched even when I was being consciously extra careful.

",3
20482,"It does not feel like Swaroski crystal to the touch, more like plastic. I even went back to the description of the product to make sure I did not make a mistake while ordering.

20515,"While I'm sure that this bracelet is lovely, I would like to let you know that if you have a Piercing Pagoda in your local mall, they sell Italian silver 925 stamped charm bracelets (7-8inches) for less than being charged here. Even with tax the ultimate price of the bracelet is cheaper than purchasing it online and paying shipping. My 7 inch bracelet is well made, hasn't lost any of its shine, and I only payed 19 dollars.I cannot imagine that the quality differs drastically from this product to the one I purchased. It is stamped with ""Italy"" like the above bracelet, as well as ""925"" and you also don't have to wait for it to arrive in the mail.
",3
20536,"Received these as a gift off my wish list...I do love the style of these earrings, but the quality is a little lacking, which is to be expected for this price. The backing on one of the earrings is a bit loose so it has me worried that I might lose one earring. Other than a slightly loose clasp, very cute earrings and overall I'm pleased.
",3
20550,"Good finish. After I received them i realized that they would probably look better in a smaller size, for my taste.
",3
20592,"This was probably worth the discounted price I paid...the previous reviews were absolutely correct; it is suited for a child or small person, although it touts an 18"" chain. The chain is very cheaply made and that 18"" is a stretch at the outside link of the adjustment, which has no ""tail"" link to use for fingertip feel. Likewise, the hardware on the other side is so conservative of materials that it is difficult to even hold the very small ring open long enough to reach the back of the neck when trying to put it on without assistance. The butterfly is nice, but just that...nice. If I had it to do over again, knowing now...I wouldn't have ordered it. But there's nothing faulty enough to warrant sending it back, either. Again, for a child it is a lovely size and gift.
",3
20593,"I got this originally for my wife, but my daughter loves it so much, and it is about a nice size for a child or teenager..good value for what you get. thx
",3
20598,"I got the sterling silver butterfly dangle earrings and pendant for $25 (they were 50% off). This was my first purchase of jewelery from Amazon, so I really didn't know what to expect. The earrings and pendant came packaged in separate cardboard jewelery boxes and each were in little plastic bags. Considering the price, the quality of the earring and pendant weren't too bad. I liked the earrings better than the pendant. I'm always looking for dangle earrings that aren't too big, so I was pleased with the tiny size of the earrings. However, for most adults, I think that the earrings would be a bit too small and dainty. These earrings would be perfect for girls or teens. If you are an adult and are looking for earrings that are tiny and cute to wear with a casual outfit then these would work as well.The pendant wasn't as cute as the earrings. The pendant came with a small silver necklace. The bottom part of the pendant is to pointy and the wings don't look that much like a butterfly. I would have liked something shaped like the earrings. If you don't mind the shape (the picture looks just like the real thing), the pendant would probably work well for girls or teens. Like the earrings, the quality is not too bad for something that was less than $15.Overall, I was pleased with my first jewelry purchase. If you are looking for something cute and inexpensive I would recommend these (especially for girls or teens).
",3
20618,"Although lovely, these earrings are very small. The stones are a bit darker and less sparkly than the photo. The earrings are too small to make the impact that you would expect from the photo. It is very difficult to see the beautiful craftsmanship. Wish they were larger. Perfect for a teen or pre teen.
",3
20622,"For the money It's ok,really small. Should have purchased a bigger one.The blue bage it came in was beautiful !!!!
",3
20635,"Some silver was chipped off the top edge of the lid when it arrived. It does not appear to be the best quality. But it is very pretty and I like the interior compartments.
",3
20659,"I received the Peace Toe Ring and it is nice for the price. I would recommend this because the price is so right you don't have to worry about losing it. This is my first experience with this company and I was very happy with them.
",3
20678,"I received this locket as a gift from my fiance and although it's pretty and casual, I have two issues with it. First, the clasp keeps catching my hair. And second, it got easily tarnished. If you want to buy this locket, make sure to buy some jewelry cleaner to keep it shiny.
",3
20685,"When I saw this ring online, I was looking for something in particular and thought this would work with a set I was creating. Even though it didn't work out for what I wanted, I ended up keeping it because it was so pretty. It's very realistic and withstands everyday wear.The craftsmanship could be a little better (hence 3 stars) only because there's no polished finish in the middle where the two bands cross over each other. But I think that adds to its ""custom"" uniqueness.I'd recommend this ring, especially now during graduation season.
",3
20689,"I wasn't extremely impressed when I received this product, but then again it was inexpensive. The band with the cz looks good but the other silver band had rough edges and I just didnt like it. I would recommend it for a teenager or youth. I will say it was very cute for the price. Great design.
",3
20693,"I love silver, and CZ but I thought they'd be a bit shinier! Wear it everyday though so it must not be too bad eh?
",3
20697,"This ring starts out looking good, but you can't fake quality. This is inexpensive and looks it, quickly. I am still looking for a wedding band replacement.
",3
20703,"I wear this ring a lot because it isn't too flashy to overwhelm my wedding ring or look funny with my casual clothing style but it definitely isn't expensive looking. The CZs have very little sparkle to them at all. You would never confuse it with a real ring. Nice costume piece for everyday, though.
",3
20705,"the ring is beautiful but one of the stones fell out the second day i had it. i still wear it occasionally, but have to turn it a certain way so it doesnt show. ok for the price, but stones could be set better.
",3
20707,"For the price this ring is okay. I was not blown away at how pretty it is like I have been with some of the others that I paid the same amount for! From a distance, it is BEAUTIFUL, just don't let no one see it up close!!
",3
20712,"This is a pretty ring. The only thing I didn't like about it was how wide the band was. I like how the front of the ring looks real.
",3
20751,"Item was smaller than i thought it would be, but i did not measure the size on my own from your description, that was my fault. it is a nice ring though
",3
20786,"I got this for my husband because the style was perfect. However, I was soon disapointed because the ring is easily scratched which is a SURPRISE because its Titanium and I thought is would be durable. Also, I find this seller to be very defensive about customers' satisfaction. too bad.
",3
20796,"I've been wearing it for a while - hope it doesn't change colors on me but so far so good!

",3
20878,"This is a spin ring with a pentacle in it. This means that the ring is composed of two bands - the inner band fits your finger and the outer band with the design can move/spin freely around the inner band. It spins very well.It has two other glyphs on it (not shown) aside from the pentacle. I have no idea if they are supposed to mean anything, but they are less complex than the pentacle and are not spaced evenly. I was expecting more pentacles or just the one, so in my opinion, this detracts from the ring.Although the ring is solid and is functionally sound, I have two major issues. First, the celtic band is cut shoddily so in some cases it's practically undefined. Second, the 'dark' areas are actually very light so only provide low contrast, which doesn't make the designs stand out.I give this product a 3 because there technically isn't anything *wrong* with it, but I don't feel it's as nice as it's presented on this website.
",3
20883,"I also purchased this ring and had the exact same result. Dark areas are very light - almost look yellowish in some areas. Celtic designs are poorly defined between glyphs. Fit and feels nice in spite of other flaws.
",3
20894,"I've been looking for small silver or white gold studs to make it less obvious that I have seven total ear piercings, and these seemed like the perfect solution! However, be warned that when they say ""tiny"" they mean ""tiny."" The ball is so itty-bitty that I can literally pull the stud-side all the way through my ear with no pain whatsoever. So far they haven't just fallen out, though, which is great.So, these are perfect if you're looking to make piercings practically disappear from view, but be warned that they might disappear from your ears, too.
",3
20901,"These fit the description--they are very tiny; much more tiny than I imagined. I'm returning these just because they're too small for my second piercing, but I can't complain much because they're exactly what they say they are! These would probably work better as a nose stud, not an earring. I've been very pleased with my other orders from Sabrina Silver, though, and would definitely recommend them to anyone.
",3
20908,"These were so tiny that they went right through! I just got my nose pierced and wanted something for days when I needed to be more discreet. I can't wear these. I am so sad. Love Sabrina Silver. Won't rate them really low because they have wonderful jewelry..but these did not work for me.
",3
20912,"I really didn't realize how tiny these are. Actually have had them pull through my hole twice. I think I'll buy the 2mm next time. Came in the mail quickly; good service :-)
",3
20927,"I will say that you get a little less than you pay for with these earrings. They look like a pair of walmart bargain bin earrings.... not worth the 38.00 with shipping that I paid. I am still going to use them as a gift only because I dont have time to replace them.
",3
20928,"I received the garnet earrings in the same style as a Christmas gift and by the end of January I had to take them to a repair shop to have the broken backs repaired. The earrings look great but you must be very gentle in putting them on.

",3
20996,"When I received the package I opened the case and my stomach dropped. What I saw was a tiny, highly polished, shiny little charm. Almost too shiny to see the emblem. I bought it for my girlfriend and could see the disappointment in her eyes. Save up your money and get a bigger one. They have nicer pewter ones at religious stores if you can find one in your area. The large, silver ones like this cost an arm and a leg.

21004,"This product is good. I enjoy it, its pretty and got here really fast, was exactly what i had wanted. But my only problem with it is that after i've worn it in the shower a few days the silver started coming off and not its just kinda an ugly grey color around some of the edges.

A few days later, the back fell off of one, we repaired it, then a day later the other one fell out completely. Be careful with these, they fall out easy.
",3
21050,"These earrings are pretty. I like the way they look, but the longer posts poke me constantly. When the earring turns in the piercing, the stud looks more like an anvil than a lightning bolt. That started an interesting conversation. All in all exactly what I was looking for though.
",3
21077,"I love the look of the pendant and got many compliments when I wore it, but the chain gets wrapped up in my hair and ends up pulling out a big tangle. If your hair is long, beware! I will have to try to replace the chain with something that doesn't latch on.
",3
21079,"I thought this pendant would be bigger and heavier, but it's so light it moves around on it's chain throughout the day. It's pretty, but not as nice as I expected. I don't think I'll be buying jewelry I can't try on beforehand anymore.
",3
21091,"The photo made this pendent look larger and more artistic than it is. I guess I was expecting too much for this price.

21121,"I found the sterling silver chain that came with the pendant to be quite nice and of good quality.I was not as impressed with the pendant itself though, and felt that it did not compliment the quality of the chain.
",3
21122,"I like this pendant. I don't think it is quite as pretty or interesting looking in reality as in the photo on the Amazon site. I'm not sure why that is. It's fine, just a bit generic and not all that eye catching.
",3
21131,"It is a beautiful design and as big as it looks. However it is paper thin. I am keeping it, but not a thick rounded pendant as it looks online.

21134,"I expected a heavier piece. I don't think it is comparable to the cost. Service was excellent. xxx xxxx xxx
",3
21139,"Got for the wife, it looks great and she likes it....but she informed me,the style of chain that it came with gets caught on her hair. When she takes it off some hair comes with it,not good. So she just puts on a different chain when she wants to wear it. I say if the person your buying it for has short hair buy it, but if they have shoulder length hair or longer plan on buying a replacement chain and consider that when looking at the price.
",3
21147,"The pendant is pretty and has fairly nice craftsmanship. But I could not give this as a gift because the snake chain is a poor quality - stiff, with several lumpy areas - and needs to be replaced.I don't think the pendant is worth the price if it needs a new chain, so it will be returned.

21164,"This set is cute, but the beads are flat like a nickel, not round like a ball. I was expecting beads shaped like a ball so I was a little disappointed when I saw they were flat.

21173,"Discolouration kicks in very quickly, and you're left with a yellowish barbell. I never really noticed anything ""glow in the dark"" about it. It's nothing special, so don't waste your time, unless you're really tired of your solid colour barbell.

21180,"This boat is quite small and light weight and only has detail on one side. I am a bit disappointed in it since it looks like it should be more 3D in the picture. It will be OK on my charm bracelet though.
",3
21181,"I gave this to my fiance as a sort of engagement band. He loves it, the only problem is, the center band spins and kind of betrays the purpose of the Claddagh (positioning vs. marital status). Plus, if your man is a rough and tumble kind of guy, this might not be the ring you want. The band started to come apart after a while and dirt and gunk gets built up in it so it doesn't spin right. If you are purchasing it as a gift for a not so rough guy, it would be great, or if it was just meant to be worn every now and then. Don't count on it to be your engagement ring though, it's not so good for that.
",3
21184,"If this ring was a little larger I would probably wear it more often. Its almost as if the size is the outer most ring. I love the design. I've actually thought about buying more as gifts for friends, but remembering to order larger sizes.
",3
21185,"I bought this ring as a Valentine's gift but couldn't give it since the hands holding the heart symbol would reverse whenever the ring spins (there are 4 of them on this ring, alternating the facing direction). It's a cute ring so I just kept it for myself.

Shortly after giving the ring to my girlfriend, the ring started turning her finger green. I guess you get what you pay for, eh? Still pleased with the ring and the price. 3 stars.

21242,"She use it every day and it looks just like the day we received it.we consider that for this prize its a descent quality ring.we first bought it to test size
",3
21262,"I am not sure what to say. all the reveiws that i read said that it was a wonderful product! not so much! I am not so impressed. I wore the ring once and it turned my finger green. When i got it I was a little disapointed.. just looking at it I new it was not real. which sucks.I was not impressed at all. i dont think i would tell any one to buy it.g.poundstones wife.

21289,"I bought this anklet as a birthday present for a friend. It came in very good condition and looks great. It is very delicate. I just hope that the young lady (15) will also like it. Her birthday theme will be butterflies.I think it looks beautiful and very feminine.

21300,"This toe ring is exactly as pictured and fits beautifully on your toes with one draw back, I found that this particular toe ring is NOT sterling silver as listed. Most sterling silver is 925 grade but this toe ring is NOT.In fact after just one day of wearing, by night I found the toe ring had turned my skin a green-blue color, resembling a bruise. This only happens when the metal is not genuine sterling silver.Buyer beware!
",3
21340,"Overall, it's a beautiful little pendant. That being said, it is... little. Based off of the measurements, I had expected something a little more substantial. I will keep it as it is too late to return for something else.
",3
21355,"My dearly beloved twisted this bangle out of shape just trying to get it off her wrist. Returned and got something else
",3
21359,"Good value for the price. Smaller than what I thought it would be. The chain is incredibly frail and will most likely snag on something and break within the next three months.
",3
21360,"The wife loved it though I felt that the blue depicted in the picture is a lot more vivid than it actually is. Seemed much more pale in reality and I agree with earlier comments that the chain seems very frail and you wouldn't want to risk your diamonds on that.Came well packaged, in fact the box they used was WAY too big and ended up costing me an unnecessary amount when I had it shipped to Kuwait.
",3
21369,"I thought this pendant was adorable when I purchased it however when I received it, I was disappointed. The top heart does not sit flat on you, it flops to the side which makes it impossible to actually see the heart. The chain is a very poor quality and will probably break quickly. I just packaged it up and am returning it.
",3
21370,"This necklace is not unattractive, but not as cute as it appears in the photo. I thought it would be three dimensional, or that one side would be a brushed finish, but that is not the case. The necklace is flat and the silver is matte. Overall, I was disappointed in the purchase, but since I purchased this item on sale, it is still worth keeping.
",3
21420,"Being into the world of metal, this thing was quite neat looking on the site. Once it was opened and taken out of the box is another thing. I think I was hoping for just a plain polished stainless steel piece, what I got was a stainless steel piece with a chrome or silver plating. The plating makes the links of this thing hard to move. I find that it binds up alot especially in the center. I gave it 3 stars cause of the plating and overall look of it. I was hoping for a rugged looking chunk of chain and what I got was a quirky lil ornamental thing.Not amazons fault nor the fault of the seller, I should have looked a lil better at what I was buying. Overall, nice piece just not what I was expecting. I kept it though and do wear it.
",3
21432,"Just got this. Excellent service. Nothing to complain about seller. A couple of things though. The 2 square pieces that holds the 3 bands together slides. I don't know if it should be tighter or not but eventually they end up by the clasp. I don't really mind it that much. I bought the bracelet because it didn't look like and ID bracelet. If it starts to bother me, I'll tighten it up with a pair of pliers.The 2nd thing is I think it's a bit expensive at about $20. It's nice but I feel it should be around $15. If I get complements like the other reviewer, then it will be worth the $20.
",3
21433,"Does not have that nice jewelry feel to it, but it looks as pictured. Not bad, but not as nice as similarly priced bracelets I have purchased.
",3
21447,"This is a simple beaded bracelet. Nice stretch. Casual and young. Dont like tags on such bracelets. Have to be clipped off and afraid of cutting the bracelet.
",3
21451,"This tie clip is beautiful, but unfortunately, when you slide it onto your tie, the blade points down, which is opposite of what you would expect...unfortunately. I am tempted to break the tie clip part off of the sword and have it soldered on in the correct fashion, but that is not the point of buying a $50+ tie clip. Regardless, it looks nice, if you like your sword facing down...
",3
21462,"These earrings are very cute, however they are not super high quality. I feel like I will break them pulling the back off the earring.
",3
21463,"it's a pair of okay earrings. not very impressive. the sign is significant, but it doesn't look very very nice. just very normal.
",3
21467,"I purchaced 2 pairs of the same earings for my 2 daughters to give to them as gifts. I was disapointed that both earings game in ONE gift box. How hard would it had been to give me TWO gift boxes for TWO sets of earings?
",3
21473,"Thanks guys it was just what my girl wanted! Your service was FAST! The product was EXCELLENT!Thank you again, you just made another Happy Customer
",3
21479,"I really love these, and so do my boyfriend. They are really cute, don't irritate my ears, and add class to all of my outfits. The problem is, they come off. You have to make sure the backs are on tight. A few days ago, I woke up and one of them had come off. Since they are so small, they are hard to find. I still haven't found one.
",3
21482,"Beautiful silver Daisy but the earring latch turns so you see the back of the earring rather than front. Kinda sticks out... I attached the earring to a French Hook and it lays nicer but looks a little rigged.
",3
21483,"The pink isn't that bright it is more dull and not very exciting. I bought this ring a few months ago and think i have yet to wear it because of the dullness of it's color.
",3
21484,"When I saw these earrings, I thought they looked so shiny and cute. Unfortunately though, when I got them, the silver was tarnished and they didn't really look like the picture.
",3
21485,"I found this not as good as the picture. I thought the blue in the picture was breath taking but the ring it's self is dull.
",3
21486,"These earrings are so pretty, but they are just a tad too long to sit on my ear correctly. They sit against the rim of cartilage above my earlobe holes and sit crooked. Not sure if I just have small ears or if others have this problem. I wish they were a couple of mm smaller, then they'd be perfect.
",3
21488,"These are pretty little earrings, but i was disappointed that the stud part was in a different place on both of them, so they hang to different lengths. Doesn't stop me from wearing them in my second pierce from time to time.
",3
21489,"Very cute belly ring but is uncomfortable for me when the top of the lock pinches my skin.
",3
21516,"This cuff looks almost exactly like it does online. They are attractive. The pair that we were shipped however did not match. One cuff had a darker gray and one had a lighter gray. The whites were the same. Not a huge deal as probably no one who sees you wearing the cuffs would notice, but it is annoying to get something brand new that isn't quite right.
",3
21520,"The color is a rich blue, but the size was very small. I was quite disappointed. If you want a bolder piece, this is not for you.
",3
21525,"Love the design and couldn't afford the ""Large"" pendant, Sure, the dimensions are given, but it sure feels very small (better yet, TINY) once I received it. (The pendant is even small in comparison to the loop in the back of the ""mother's head"" for the necklace.) Other than that, the design is beautiful and well executed. (Maybe a bit expensive, and the MSRP is certainly inflated to make the actual price look like a bargain!)
",3
21527,"I am very pleased w/ the quality of the cross, but the chain was a little small.
",3
21530,"The ring is very dainty. It does have some sparkle. The band is very thin, which I liked about it because I have very petite hands. The only problem is that I've had the ring for about a month and a diamond has already fallen out.

21545,"These earrings are OK but I was dissapointed that they only came in a little blue velvet bag instead of a box.

21567,"well,I received this ring and love it. However, it is not exactly like the one I thought it should be ~~~~However, it is fine I think~
",3
21569,"This product was absolutely beautiful! It does wear out fast! In about a year's time, the silver coating wore off & was turning my daughter's finger green.
",3
21573,"I loved this ring when I received it but shortly after I lost a stone in it. It is also a bit uncomfortable to wear.
",3
21586,"This is a great necklace and comes in nice packaging, perfect for gifts. The downfall is that the necklace chain came to me in knots that I haven't been able to completely undo.
",3
21591,"Take the title literally. Yes there nice, and decent quality but not what i expected from the picture. The tips of the ""starfish"" don't bend to the side like a starfish looks like, or as pictured. So they look like regular-old star earrings.
",3
21594,"The pendant is almost as small as the earrings they set as purchase togeter, it says 1 inch lenght, but it's I guess around 10 centimeters(yes I like the MKS system more), soon I'll upload a video, as well, the box where the pendant comes, it's too large in comparison to the pendant, it makes it look even smaller that it already is.
",3
21621,"These belly button ring is cute but it is very very large so it sticks out pretty far from my stomach. I thought the two balls would rest against my kin, but they literally stick out like an inch.
",3
21625,"I bought this ring as a promise ring for mii girlfriend. When I showed it to her online she went crazy for it and really really wanted it. When i presented it to her she blew her mind. This is a very pretty ring but the cut of the diamonds are scratchy and hard. For example if she was wearing the ring and rubbed on my arm it would feel like a claw running down my arm. Its still a very nice and beautiful ring but its a little too rough. I would still redommend it just wear it on a necklace or something jus dont hit or rub people with it on.
",3
21638,"I was looking for another vendor beside Macy's on Amazon to buy this piece. I ended up getting it at KJ at my local mall. This gothic cross design has a mirror backdrop with a brushed stainless steel matte finish on the second level of the cross. The very top cross has some diamonds place within the design. On the back of the cross, it has an large S in old English font, which works out well for me since S is in my name.I looked at the other designs and this Gothic cross design was the best. It is really heavy and people will come up to you and ask can I feel it. The mirror stainless finish makes it shine. The diamonds are also bright in the sun and store department lights.The warranty on this piece is lifetime, all you have to do is have it looked at by a jeweler who is licensed to sell Russell Simmons Stainless jewerly.One word of advice on this piece. It is mirror finished Stainless, so it will and shows scratches. If you use an stainless shine cloth with a cleaner you can null and shine past those scratches.
",3
21641,"I got about what I expected for the price. There was not a better price on the internet for earrings in this size. The color was decent, but the clarity was just ok. Definitely some spots if you look hard enough.
",3
21652,"I'm giving 3 stars because I like the chain I received enough to keep. The seller loses 2 stars for bad customer service and inaccurate product description. I have received no communication from the seller - no order confirmation/shipping email and no response to my email. The chain I received was just under 4MM, not the 5MM described. I emailed the seller several days ago to ask if I received the wrong item - no response.
",3
21653,"The chain that arrived was lovely, but it was not the type that was ordered. And, I'm not taking the time to return it. Just won't order from here again.
",3
21663,"The earrings are quite cheap looking, emeralds are completely dull, unlike the internet photo. However, shipping was fast and accurate.
",3
21664,"Got these as a Christmas gift for my wife. Great price for the size, but if your lady would rather quality over quantity then these are not for you. Inclusions were very noticable without magnification. My wife is about the size so that wasn't a problem.
",3
21672,"I read the previous reviews and was told that the earrings might have a slight coloring to them. When I received them they were quite yellow. Size was ok. Decided to keep them and use in my third hole in ear. ill order other earring with better color and clarity
",3
21698,"I love this ring, but I have one complaint.. I didnt have it on for 2 hours and it turned my finger black! But for the price I cant really complain.
",3
21699,"Got this ring as a gift, the stone looks much darker than the picture(almost black) and the setting looks a bit costume jewelryish.
",3
21700,"This was a very pretty ring, the only this was after only a few weeks it began to tarnish.
",3
21718,"Can't really say much of the item from a girl's point of view. I bought this for my girlfriend, not sure if she'd like it. All i can say is that the ring pretty much catches attention. Love the blue stone!
",3
21743,"I've never had to do a review like this from Amazon before - weird.Anyway, the Celtic Blue Sapphire Ring was disappointing in that the stone was not entirely raised from the setting, making it look flat when you look at it from above. Too expensive for its quality (and I doubt it's a real sapphire). Also, size 7, my usual size, was too big.
",3
21747,"3.5 stars, but definitely not 4 stars. I have never been a person into celtic designs but really like this piece. I wear this ring twice a week. I agree with one reviewer that it can look like costume jewelry, but we get what we pay for since it is a lab grown stone. The name ""genuine blue sapphire ring"" is very deceiving and I was almost tempted to give 2 stars for this reason alone. Real sapphire can cost up to hundreds and thousands of dollars so I am still happy with this find.
",3
21776,"I purchased this ring because I have one in Garnet that I like very much. This is advertised as being Genuine Sapphire. It is not which is not really that big of a deal because it's just as pretty. What makes this a 3 for me is that it's also advertised as being Sterling Silver. It is not. After about 3 days of wearing it, the ""silver"" was badly tarnished and wouldn't come clean even when I polished it. Then the next day I noticed that the inside and edges of the band were turning black which also wouldn't come off. Then the very next day the silver came off completely on the inside and outside of the band part. Now I know a lot of people think that if something isn't real silver or real gold it will turn your skin green. That is not the case. I work at a Jeweler and it's things that you are eating or medicine you are taking that makes the reaction with you skin and turns you green. Even 24k gold can turn you green or brown if your eating or taking a medicine that reacts to it. I never had that problem with this ring. It never turned me green. But when I tested it it isn't real silver. I don't mind and I still think it's very pretty ring. I just dont like to be misled. And even if it wasn't real, it shouldn't have flaked off so easily. Overall I like this ring very much but I doubt I will buy anything from ""Silver Insanity"" again
",3
21777,"This is a nice ring, but the explanation is very deceptive. This is a lab-grown stone, not a ""genuine blue sapphire"" as the title claims. Also, the stone is not dark blue as the picture shows, but more of a light-medium blue. If you don't mind this stone being lab-grown this is a very nice ring.
",3
21778,"I am disappointed by the stone in this ring. It's very dull and looks black most of the time, even in sunlight. It might be that the cut is keeping all the stone deep in the silver, not allowing much light into the stone.
",3
21779,"I've had the ring for about 2 months now. It is beautiful, the blue sapphire is very pretty & I get lots of compliments on it. The only downside is that it began to tarnish within 2 weeks of being shipped to me.
",3
21786,"I had gotten the wrong size for this ring at a size 11 and I never returned it to get a smaller size to my mistake. But I like the ring.
",3
21853,"I have a problem where I can only use a certain kind of metal for my belly ring like a certain kind of steel or where my piercing is gets all red, and this did not do that at all it was fine, no redness it did not irriate my belly at all, but if I had my pants up too high or when I was sitting, it pressed into my skin and was very uncomfortable, and after about a day of having it in I had to take it out because it began to pain. So it is good for like a one day thing, but you can't leave it in to long.
",3
21871,"If you are not familiar with carat size, you are going to be disappointed. These earrings are much smaller than shown in the picture. They are suitable for a baby rather than an adult.However, they do sparkle.UpdateI've had these for 4 months and they are nice, tiny earrings.Nonetheless, I lost (but found it later) one of the earrings in my house because one of the earrings has a loose friction-back closure. I should have checked them more carefully when they arrived and returned them. My earring had some problems so be aware.
",3
21885,"I bought these for my husband and they are really tiny. I think they would look great with a ladies french cuff shirt, but they just seem very wimpy for a man. They did ship as promised - in a nice box and on time.
",3
21890,"I thought it was too small. People have to get in your face before they can see all the beautiful detail. That is my only complaint about it. It is very pretty, but just too small. I think it would of been nicer if it were bigger, but I still like it & still will wear it.
",3
21895,"I really like the look of this. It is a bit heavy but attractive. My only problem is that it has tarnished pretty bad in the few months that I have had it.
",3
21898,"The picture is a little misleading and this is a pretty heavy necklace. Be prepare to replace the thin, small chain it comes on, unless you have the neck of a 12 year old.
",3
21899,"Was just curious as to whether I was the only person to realise that this pendant was a pentaCLE,not a pentaGRAM, as it's listed on the title?That just truly bugs me for some odd reason,ppl not not knowing the proper title/term for product theyre trying to sell
",3
21921,"the materia is good but the stones fall out after very little use I wore this navel ring for about a month then i noticed that one of the side stones are gorn,after that they kept falling out one by one until there are no more left, so now i'm wonder how long would it take before the big stone in the middle falls out.but i guess i won't know cause i'm using one from body candy right now, to see how that holds up
",3
21929,"The bracelet was nice and worth the price. However, it is a bit small. Luckily, the friend who I purchased it for is quite petite. Had I bought it for myself I would have had to return it. I'm 5'8 and weigh 135 lbs so if you are my size you may consider not buying.
",3
21941,"When these earrings arrived, I was a little disappointed. Mine were barely pushing 6.5mm, and were much smaller than I was expecting. The color and luster was beautiful, perhaps even more shiny than the picture and the backs seemed sturdy enough. If that was the only issue, I gladly would have kept the earrings, however as I was scanning the ""appraisal certificate"" I noticed some typos (which you can clearly see if you look at the picture of the certificate!). Example: ""...sat water pearls..."" rather than SALT water pearls. I find it hard to believe any reputable company would have typos on a certificate, and because of this, I question their quality/authenticity. If you are looking for pretty black pearl earrings, these get the job done, but I decided to get my $100 back and put it towards a pair I KNEW was good quality. I guess that is the risk you run ordering jewelry online!
",3
21945,"I was somewhat disappointed by the quality of this item. Perhaps I expected too much since I freely admit to being a novice jewelry purchaser.
",3
21952,"First I paid $26 for them, then when they are shipped to me with a brochure, the same set of earrings are $16, would have been nice to only pay that for them since I get an ear infection because the sterling silver is not the grade they claim it to be. So in other words, I now have a pair of earring I overpaid for and can't wear.
",3
21953,"These are really cute earrings, they claim to be made with 925 sterling silver material (usually 925 sterling silver doesn't cause irritations to my skin). However, I am allergic to the earrings metal, I get infection on both earlobs after one day of wearing. It is a shame I really like the look of these. =(
",3
21986,"A bit noisy when turned on, but it does the job and leaves your gemstones sparkling clean.
",3
21992,"I've ordered this in 16"" length, but I ended up with an 18"" long necklace. (Measured with a measuring tape.) I didn't get charged more for it, but I had something in mind when I ordered the 16"", and now it won't work. I don't know if this is a one time error or what.A regular snake chain with lobster clasp and 7 beads/balls, it isn't bad for $12. It would've been better if the chain has diamond-cutting as well, like the seller's other snake chain necklaces.The biggest bead is about 8mm in diameter, and all beads have diamond cutting, so it gives more sparkle. The beads slide/move around the chain, but you caN'T use the chain without the beads because the holes in it aren't big enough to go thru the locks. The good thing about that is you won't lose the beads. But then, you can't use it as a regular chain for a one-pendant-look either.It's not bad for everyday wear. It is noticeable but not over the top. You can wear it alone or layer with other chains. If you have detachable charms from your bracelet/s (you know, the kind that comes with a round clasp), you can put it in between the beads for a different look.
",3
22009,"Rapid receipt. Well packaged to prevent damage in transit. Disappointed that back of jewelry chest is plywood. Description on Amazon.com was misleading, claiming chest made entirely of rosewood. Therefore, item is overpriced.

22071,"It's a good buy, if you need a basic chain. It's one grade above average and the only thing that was great was the delivery time.
",3
22088,"You get what you pay for. It looks nice but the clasp is super cheaply done the part it hooks on is barely big enough to fit it in. I would pay a little more for a nicer one.
",3
22102,"I like the chain, except the 18"" was more like a 16"", you may want to buy a longer chain if you don't want the necklace close to your throat. The necklace is very thin and dainty it is probably best not to hang a heavy pendant on it. The necklace is not made for everyday wear and I'm worried it is going to break it so thin. I like the chain and will keep it for church or other special events.
",3
22103,"The necklace is nice but its a lot smaller than i expected. The clasp is also really tiny and sticks sometimes, so I replaced it.
",3
22136,"The clasp has too small an opening to make it practical to use, too bad because otherwise it is a great chain.
",3
22138,"Some of the Necklesses I ordered for my wife came with no chains. I ordered two 22 1mm inch chains. I didn't realize how small and delicate 1mm is. My bad..........I should have ordered a 3 of 4 mm. I'll know better next time. The chains that do come with certain items are too small and flimsey. They are very delicate and break easily
",3
22214,"Links of the necklace are more small than I thought. The chain is more fine, will be easily broken, and not sturdy enough for some of my pendants for which I bought the chain. The chain is beautiful and dainty, just more dainty than I expected.
",3
22222,"The chain arrived very promptly, but within a few weeks had discolored to a unappealing dark grey. Disappointing, but you get what you pay for.
",3
22231,"Is much thinner than expected, but, still very nice. Hopefully it can withstand having a pendant hung from it. Will be used to hang a Saint Christopher medallion.
",3
22361,"Not as high-quality as I expected, but it will do what we need (hang around a neck). Good deal for the price.
",3
22368,"Good chain to hang a small pendant from. Picture shows a nicer clasp than what you actually get. It's just a plain little spring ring cheapie clasp.
",3
22369,"nothing super special. wish I had purchased one that was longer, felt it was too small, but for the most part it was okay
",3
22398,"It is almost to shiny and white to appear too be real sterling silver. I'm somewhat disappointed. Also no chains available in 15,, 16, & 17 inch lengths.
",3
22526,"The clasp is not like the one in the photo, which is the whole reason I chose this chain. I am not happy. The chain however is very nice.
",3
22527,"You get what you pay for...in this instance. I think 1mm is too thick for most small/elegant style pendants. The color is also really light. It's not a nice silver shimmer, it almost looks white. The whiteness and the thickness of this necklace doesn't go well together. Not worth it in my opinion. Someone said it looks like a doggie necklace. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point.
",3
22540,"The chain looks nice, but when you open the clasp, it doesn't close immediately. You have to force it closed. I was a little disappointed by this, and will be requesting an exchange. Otherwise, it shines nicely and chain seems sturdy.
",3
22574,"This chain is dainty and small. Its a nice chain. I always liked the box chain since it doesnt catch on clothing or hair. I purchased this for my 8 year old but the length was too short for her. So I ended up returning it.
",3
22589,"I was astonished to find a sterling silver chain for such a low price. Maybe it was just the chain I ordered, but the clasp broke after less than two months of gentle use. It looks good, lays well and you can't beat the price, but now the next box chain I buy will be at cost plus the price of this one. Not fixable.UPDATE 2/15/2011: The second chain we ordered from this company also broke with no force. It's a nice chain, but we're moving on to a new brand.
",3
22606,"The chain is nice, but the clasp is cheap and doesn't open or close well. Nearly lost the necklace the first time I wore it because the clasp didn't close all the way.

",3
22701,"The ring actually looks nice, but the picture is a little misleading. The whole back of the ring is hollow. Overall, the ring weighs about as much as a ring that you would get in a quarter machine. I can't see how the price can be anywhere over 200 dollars. I'm considering returning this.
",3
22705,"these are really nice earrings. the only thing that bothered me was since the item picture was so close, i thought they would be a bit bigger. other than that they are really cute. so, if u like larger studs to be seen from afar, go for a 7mm or 8mm.

22715,"Everything was just perfect on time and what I expected Will shop againThanks

22737,"The pendant is lovely and looks like the picture, but I had two problems with it. The first is that when I wore the pendent, it completely lost its translucent quality. It looked like a dark purple rectangle and the dragon was hardly visible. The second problem is that every time I leaned forward, even slightly, the pendant would flip around to the other side. Within the space of an hour the pendant spent as much time with its back to the world as it did with the carved side facing front. That may not bother everyone, but it drove me crazy, so I reluctantly returned the pendant. The chain was handsome but did not feel substantial enough for this pendant. But, you can always use a different chain.
",3
22739,"It is nice and my DIL likes it. It really should have a larger gauge necklace for the weight of the pendant.
",3
22755,"The ring looks good and is definitely worth the money. The ring is not that comfortable but you get used to it. It is slightly thinner than 6mm but hardly noticeable. It looks great though! You wont find anything better for the price. A good buy.
",3
22769,"The ring actually looks nice, but the picture is a little misleading. The whole back of the ring is hollow. Overall, the ring weighs about as much as a ring that you would get in a quarter machine. I can't see how the price can be anywhere over 200 dollars. I'm considering returning this.

22801,"Pugster Christian Charm Bracelet ( Cross Teacher Dangle Religious Beaded )I didn't get these on sale. Not worth full price. Cute, but oxidizes very quickly, and should not be worn by anybody who has nickel allergy.
",3
22811,"I like these earrings, but they tend to itch, so there may be some nickel in them. Otherwise I like them.
",3
22835,"Was on sale for $50, and that's about all I would consider it to be worth. Nice chain, though.
",3
22837,"I believe the title says it all.Basically, the necklace is quite nice, and my girlfriend was very pleased to recieve it. The stones are not exactly big, so make sure you understand how much .15 cttw is. But they are big enough to be seen at least.The chain itself however, lacks. It was too weak to last 2 weeks. So if you do buy this, make sure that she wears it only sparingly, or buy a heavier chain.
",3
22838,"I think the pendant was great for the price, but the chain was frail.
",3
22893,"This is a beautiful anklet, but it is not strong enough to be worn around the ankle. I broke mine after a month or two. anklets need to be sturdy.
",3
22894,"I bought this ring as an upgrade to my basic Tungsten Carbide band. I wanted a dressier look since I no longer work in an environment that beats up softer metals.The ring is very nice looking and the size fits well. However I expected a ""Comfort Fit"" ring to have buffed out, smooth edges to the Florentine cuts and edges. I gave up wearing the ring after a week of daily wear when the inside of my middle and little fingers became so raw that wearing the ring became too painful to endure.I will keep the ring to pull out if I want a dress ring, but otherwise it will reside in my dresser drawer. I will wear my plain old ""Comfort Fit"" Tungsten Carbide band for daily wear.
",3
22926,"Very nice quality, good value, but colour is brown; not gray, nor black, as photographed. Slightly larger than seed pearls.
",3
22927,"The price was amazing, and it looks good quality too! the only reason for the 3 stars was because within a couple hours of wearing it the clasp broke, but the company is very nice and offered to fix it asap.
",3
22935,"my mistake, I really assumed by the photo that this was going to be a LOT bigger...I didnt think to check the small print. I gave it away.
",3
22944,"Product arrived quickly and nicely boxed. Quality of the pearls is quite good. Only issue is that the connection between one strand and the clasp came apart the first time my wife wore this item. I was able to fix it myself, but the entire clasp and connections seem to be lower quality than I expected. We will probably have a local jeweler install a better clasp.
",3
22946,"This ring was a little too small for my ring finger. It would have been better as a pinky ring.
",3
22950,"I purchased these in error thinking they were a smaller size, but I wore them a few times and after a few compliments don't have a problem with the size. I had always worn the 1 5/8"" and now I have both. Enjoy!
",3
23015,"The ring is beautiful in itself! But I found it a little on the small side! The service was great though, I got the ring in no time at all!
",3
23020,"I was very happy when I saw this, it was beautiful and I did not feel it was flimsy at all. I wore it about 5-6 times in 2months and then put it away. When I looked at it a month later, it had lost its shine and looked very dull. I also think it is turning darker. But it still looks good on my foot.
",3
23034,"Yeah it's a little ornate and foofy but I still like it. It's well-made, light, and the colors are brilliant.
",3
23035,"This necklace is worth the 4.99 I paid. The large ""crystal"" has slight defects that draw attention to the fact it is essentially plastic. The rest of the necklace is attractive and I may just remove the pendant part.
",3
23039,"This necklace was for a friend and I was surprised that it was somewhat larger than expected. Also, I ordered it before Valentine's Day and it arrived well after as opposed to many of the other items I ordered.
",3
23043,"This is a really pretty bracelet, the stones are very light in color, not quite as nice as pictured, but still pretty and I would keep it except the bangle has a catch system which simply will not stay closed so I have to send it back.
",3
23047,"the materials used were of moderate quality, decent enough for the price. I was somewhat disappointed to see how over-sized it was. Not one of the better products that I purchased.
",3
23059,"The cross is modeled right after the famous cross that Buffy wore in season 1, and 2.The product it self isn't meant to be an official symbolic object of the lord, hence, on the back of the cross we have a ""FOX 2005 TM"" trademark. However, any buffy fan will be very glad to own this. This 2 inch, silver, cross is very gender neutralized, as in, a male or female could easily wear it without worrying if it's ""famine"" or ""masculine,"" however, the 18 inch necklace itself is very famine looking. I myself am a 6'0 male, and the necklace was to short to wear with comfort, so I ended up using a different chain.The velvet box is very tasteful, and does have the buffy logo right on top. It's just like any other box a normal ring, ear rings, etc, would come in. The inside is no different.
",3
23069,"I got this yesterday, and I was sadly a little disapointed. It is pretty small, which I was prepared for, but its also quite flat. Since there is no pictures where its shown from the side, I was hoping for it to be more 3D, with horns maybe pointing a little out, and not just to the sides. Also the ring which it's attatched to the silicone necklace is very big compared to the rest of the pendant, so it looks a bit odd.But, it's ok. Giving it 3 weak stars
",3
23070,"Although my husband was very happy with this gift, I thought it looked a little fake. It's very shiny.
",3
23071,"I ordered this O-ring clasp on purpose, but didn't receive this item. What I got instead was a much heavier lobster claw clasp - the exact clasp I was trying to avoid because of it's weight. While the chain itself is beautiful - I'm not happy. Apparently, I can return the chain and be credited for it's cost, minus all shipping and handling charges of course!! Round trip shipping and handling cost 50% of the item charges...guess they were counting on that!! UPDATE - Customer Service has been extremely helpful!! Not only did they arrange for my return...but made certain I received the correct necklace ASAP. I am very happy with both the beautiful chain, but their Customer Service as well!! :-)

",3
23078,"The one I got had more facets to it than pictured here. I like the more facets. Appears to be facetted by hand. It's natural chrystal. I'm trying to remember what I heard on Coast to Coast AM talk radio about crystals...how to test it for being positive? Need to change it some to get it to work for me. Wonder if it's too big after reading the other reviews. Smaller would be better for what I would like to use it for.
",3
23091,"Makes for a nice little gift. Size is a bit small, which means that it requires very small pictures to fit in the inside.
",3
23093,"I use this locket to carry an aspirin, for medical reasons. Unfortunately, I sweat a lot and the moisture gets into the locket, melts the aspirin, and the locket corrodes. Not good! So I've resorted to removing the chain and carrying the locket in my pocket. That seems to work ok. So I would not advise it for carrying any kind of pill if you wear it around your neck.
",3
23104,"The earrings are unique but very ""flimsy"". I haven't worn them yet and truly hope they will stand up to normal wear. I will keep them for several reasons...1) Harry Mason guarantees them 2) I like the style 3) I need the Rose Gold 4) they are unique. Besides the extremely light weight of the solid 14 Kt. Gold, I think the price was a bit high. I would not have purchased them if I had to pay the additional $7.95 that Harry Mason charges for s/h...thanks Amazon for that perk.
",3
23106,"I loved the earrings when I received them. I still like the design. BUT....one fell off. Yes, the ""impossible to fall off"" earring did just that. NEVER say ""NEVER."" Sadly, I have another single earring to add to my collection of single earrings.
",3
23116,"I like the bracelet, but it's too wide for me and keeps coming undone. Plus the heart is so heavy it kept banging on everything and was inconvenient...in the end I took it off and wear it as a pendant. So generally nice, but probably better suited for someone else.
",3
23128,"I had just ordered the bracelet two days before and I just received it yesterday! I thought I was going to receive it until the 22. Anyway, I recently had the original juicy bracelet but somehow my sister lost it -__-. It's nothing compared to the original one. this one feels much lighter of course because it's cheap gold but It's decent enough to wear. I actually really like it and it came in its cute box also. Ill try not to wear it too much as ive seen in previous reviews that the color wears off.
",3
23156,"Not bad. Item arrived in a timely matter and is of the heigth and weight I expected. Looks very similar to the picture and the price was right for what it is.
",3
23166,"When I recieved my ring I was in love with it. But not even a week later I slipped my ring on and it broke! I know it was not because of it being to small because I ordered it a size bigger than what I wear. Now I am the proud owner of a broken moonstone ring. My friend is going to super glue it back together for me, but it wont be the same. I am very sad that my ring broke.
",3
23170,"This is a super cute ring. I have gotten many compliments. IT IS FRAGILE. I saw the reviews that this is a fragile piece, but I still wanted it. I wore it for about a week or so before I cracked it. I hit my hand on something as I was walking by and it cracked through. The ring is still in tact for now, but It is a shame as it's a beautiful piece. If you buy this be VERY careful with it.
",3
23171,"Is there any way that I can get a moonstone ring from gem avenue? I love moonstone but I like it real! Thanks you, I love how it looks but it won't be as beautiful if it's faux material
",3
23183,"In the picture the ring appears mostly white, and well half mine is whitish and the other half is translucent., so i was a little upset at that, but it's a $5 ring so you get what you pay for. doesn't feel like plastic to me, feels more like glass and has a neat glow. biggest downside is it's massive thickness. i bought both this ring and the onyx band and the onyx is much thinner and comfortable and you could forget your wearing it. I feel the moonstone is there the entire time i have it on.
",3
23184,"I purchased this ring as a pinky ring. It was beautiful and well made but all it took was one hit against a door handle and it cracked. So While I do really like this purchase I would not recommend for every day use. Maybe it could be party wear :)
",3
23186,"It is very interesting looking and exactly as promised though. The pictures do not do it justice. I'd recommend being careful with it though as it doesn't look like it will last long if you don't exercise caution with it.
",3
23190,"had to send it back, but if they had it in my size i would love it
",3
23194,"Please be aware the charms are very tiny. They are pretty but smaller than I realized
",3
23197,"bought these fr my sister and she said they're too small (not really a 4g). She was in the shower and one fell out! otherwise i like the color
",3
23204,"Necklace is ok for the price. If I had seen in person would not have ordered.

23247,"This pair of earrings are sweet but plain. The stone is thin. What you see is what you get.

23251,"Recently, I purchased this chain from JewelryWeb for a rather large and unusual pendant, based on the photo shown on Amazon. Without seeing the item in person, it was difficult to determine the suitability of the chain for this piece of jewelry, but I thought it might work, it was the length/thickness that I needed, and the sale price was an excellent buy. The item was received from the supplier quickly, but upon receipt, I realized that this chain would not suit the pendant (although the chain in itself was fine). I contacted Amazon and JewelryWeb the following day and returned the item to the supplier shortly thereafter. Not only was the supplier very efficient in processing my refund, it also provided excellent customer service through the refund process. I would definitely purchase another item from JewelryWeb and highly recommend their customer service.
",3
23253,"It's smaller than I thought it would be and the leaves don't look as delicate as pictured. I bought the ring as a size 7 and ended up having to adjust it to a size 6 just to make it look like the picture. It's still a nice ring, but I got what I paid for.
",3
23261,"It would be a good ring but it dosen't fit. also, I don't like the fact that it is adjustable. I thought that it was a fixed ring.
",3
23273,"but shiny. The stars are not solid, rather being sort of clam-like. Each star folds together and inserts into the next, leaving a visible gap which makes the bracelet look cheap. It is also very light. One side of the stars is puffy and the other side is flatter, and both sides were easily scratched during normal wear. So much for my 5-year anniversary gift.

23278,"HARD TO FIND A GOOD PRICED NON-EXPENSIVE OWL NECKLACE. THIS FIT THE TICKET. PACKAGED WITH ITS OWN BOX, EASY SHIPPING THROUGH MAIL.

23302,"These are cute. The chips are a not that big, good for a casual day.I thought the were going to be bigger and better quality chips.

23356,"Item was ok - I did not like the way it looked on my finger once I received it. I gave it to my mom and she loved it - she wears it all the time.
",3
23360,"This ring was ok, but the outer parts of the ring bend very easily and the stone itself rattles after a week of owning it. This ring is exactly what you are paying for, it really wasn't exactly what i expected but i should have known better. I wouldn't suggest it for anyone.
",3
23387,"I don't want to bash this product because I love it at the same time but the truth is that it doesn't take much for the chain to tarnish. The charm is still in good shape but after 3 times of wearing it I now have to buy a new chain or buy tarnish remover. Other than that it's very pretty.
",3
23389,"This is a cute bracelet in sterling, but the links were essentially formed over a mold...so the underside is hollow. In the picture it seems to be a substantial bracelet with a little weight to it. And the product weight is listed in lbs which is clearly incorrect, but I was a little disappointed when it arrived. If it was purchased for me, I would have returned it. On the other hand, my son's 15 y/o girlfriend (for whom it was intended) was thrilled.
",3
23392,"Based on the picture I would've assumed this to be a little more heavy/high quality. The chain is tiny. 17"". I purchased this as a gift for my husband who travels a lot, but he definitely won't be actually wearing this.
",3
23414,"Was larger than expected, however, being a fan of Rocky i feel it is worth the money
",3
23426,"Take out a ruler, because if you think it's thin, you're right. It was a nice bracelet all in all. I was slightly disappointed to see miniscule scuff marks on it -- it wasn't as ""clean"" as some silver jewelry is. Then again, it was only $17. For anyone buying this for a man, I would suggest the next one up. The thicker one.
",3
23452,"I was hoping for a nicer charm. The back is concave, and I think that it looks very cheap. Probably not worth what I paid.
",3
23479,"I added these to my wish list and received them as a birthday gift. they look better in the picture.
",3
23486,"At first I was diappointed- I expected them to look like pictured- They don't- But ofter putting on a blouse- They do pick up some color- But not as pictured. I will keep them-The quailty is good for the price & the packaging & time of arrival was great- I will buy more items & recommend seller-

23527,"pretty but small these were very hard to get on and or off maybe a teenager would be able to wear these i couldn't
",3
23549,"Lovely design. I have to wear this a some more to determine the quality becuase the color seemed unreal. I had to polish it on the first day.
",3
23551,"I thought the band would be a little thicker. I could see where the end of the weaves were soldered together.
",3
23556,"Product is smaller than expected, approx. 3/4 inch instead of inch mentioned. Otherwise, very nice. Don't expect to actually see the diamonds if you're eyes aren't perfect.
",3
23563,"I really didnt read the product information very well on this ring. I wasnt really happy when I got it. The sunflowers are so small you canbarely see them on the ring. It looks like you just have a band on.Would not recommend.
",3
23581,"Very pretty/shiny earrings but way too small for my ears and my ears are pretty small. These earrings are for a child plain and simple, easy to put in if these things fit your ears, everyone who had trouble putting these on barely made the cut! Would be easy to put on a child since they are sized for one. Other than not fitting, I love them!! Would wear them everyday if they fit me, I'm giving them to a friends 5 yr old daughter :)
",3
23600,"its pretty and only 7 dollars but some of the stars are mishapen
",3
23644,"I have to say, the four laser links purchased were really nice and arrived promptly. However, the laser links are wearing off and fading within weeks.
",3
23646,"It's a nice ring, but looks more than a little weathered with obvious imperfections with some of the elephants. This could be part of the 'antique' look, though.
",3
23670,"Beautiful ring, but my band broke two weeks after I got it. Be careful with it and it's a nice ring.
",3
23685,"These are great earrings, but very small!! Because they are so small, it is difficult for anyone to notice what they actually are. They also took forever to get to my house.
",3
23690,"The stones in this bracelet are much lighter than in the picture. I would describe them as pale amethyst. The faceting, which I believe is called checkerboard, really catches the light. 7 1/4"" in length, 5mm wide.
",3
23700,"Nice looking but it was smaller in scale than I expected. It is lightweight. I was surprised that it was made in China.
",3
23701,"the product arrived in perfect condition. shipping is ridiculously slow. will not order again from this seller.
",3
23704,"These earrings are lovely, medium size and weight; they give a gentle tug to the ear, but are not so heavy as to be uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the design has two problems. First, the earwires are a very narrow gauge. One of mine broke off after a week of careful wear. I will have to visit a jewelry repair shop and pay to have them modified to accomodate heavier earwires, which will increase the price of the earrings. Second, the lotus flower dangles at the bottom tend to hang up on one another and become stuck, as a result of parts of the weave being uneven or too close together. Perhaps you will get a pair that does not hang up; I did not. In any case, the earwires are much too thin and too short to have the strength to support the earring. If you buy these, you might look into replacing the wires.
",3
23748,"I love the color but for some reason the backs aren't tight. I've gotten lots of complements on the color, I just wish the backs were tighter. It was my Valentine's Day gift that I got to choose myself.
",3
23754,"The earrings arrived in a few days and I gave them as a gift. The receiver liked them very much
",3
23766,"I did not expect only a pendant...but a chain as there is one in the picture. Then the pendant has a hole in it and is not lined up well. Actually i should have gone to the local walmart and bought one...would have been cheaper and included a chain... My fault for expecting more than was being offered
",3
23779,"This ring is exactly like one that I already own which I paid $8.00 on sale at a local department store. The seller charges $6.95 for shipping which they paid less than $2.00 for. I gave 3 stars because I like the ring but save yourself some money and buy it at your local store. You can buy almost 3 rings for the price they charged.
",3
23781,"Love their designs and they have always been a good seller. SilverSpeck.... PLEASE use czs in your products instead of these disgusting little diamond chips that no one seems to like. Either they are to small and no one can notice them or there is barely any to notice. Little czs would be waaayyy more attractive. TRUST me on this one :)
",3
23782,"I bought these as a gift for my friend but am exchanging them for some others. I wasn't particularly blown away by them as I was for the other ones I bought. The stones are nice, but the workmanship isn't too great (for ex., the stones arent centered on the disks and again, the silver looks coated or something). Overall, they're just OK. SilverSpeck has nicer selections to choose from.
",3
23799,"this necklace was given to me by my family for the holidays. it is very pretty, but for the price paid, it was not a great value as the amethyst in the center was rather small, and the moonstones do not glisten as much as the picture depicts. it is quite pretty, but much more understated. at about $25 is the most i would pay for it.
",3
23802,"The earings are not too bad but they are smaller than what I thought they would be. They are suitable for casual, maybe work. Nothing to jump up about but then again they are still cute.
",3
23814,"On line the earrings look as though they had small beads circling the stones and it looked well defined. With the actual earrings the details were less than crisp and precise. The stones look smaller on the earrings and the actual earrings are slightly over sized for my taste.
",3
23824,"more for a child/ teenager/young girl than adult- i returned it for that reason. the return service was very effective.
",3
23829,"This bracelet is too long to wear around my wrist and I do not have small wrists.
",3
23834,"Adequate quality for what it is. Didn't have it long before our home was burglarized, though. They took everything! (Knuckleheads, what are they going to do with this pin?)
",3
23835,"Bought this as a gift. The picture shown is not exactly what I got. The bird with the green head, on the left, has a blue body. The middle bird has a red head and green body. The bird on the right has a blue head with an orange body. It was cheap, and I'm sure the person who I bought this for will still like it (she's a bird lover). It is a small pin, but I like that quality.
",3
23839,"The ring is nice, but in the picture, the band appears to be black, which is not true. Of course, in dim lighting, the band appears to be somewhat black, but in direct lighting, the band is a light gray. Overall, though, the product is high-quality metal.
",3
23841,"This item looks like it would be a heavyweight metal, when, in fact it is not. It almost has a 'plastic' feel to it. Other than that, the ring looks like the picture.
",3
23842,"I like this piece but it really is very very slim , small , and maybe not worth th e price . It does look nice but it is not a braclet that is all that noticeable. I am going to keep it , but have to ""pair it "" with other braclets for any effect ............
",3
23896,"The ring seems to run a little small as I cannot wear it on my ring finger. The yellow is not as warm as most citrines - it just looks fake. I will be giving to one of my daughters as I cannot wear it.

24036,"These earrings are simply gorgeous. They are weighty (as you'd expect with so many pearls), and hence the problem - they did well with the earrings and skimped on the hooks.the earrings are big, but not too big - they make a big impact. I put them on and tossed my hair, and one of the earrings flew off. The bend of the fish hook wires is awful. The gauge of the wire is too flimsy for the weight of the earring, and without a way to fasten these so they don't fly off, you won't have these earrings LONG (they're guaranteed to be lost.)What a shame the makers did such a wonderful job with the earrings and got cheap with the hooks.I'm still keeping them, though. I'm going to replace the cheap wires with sterling leverbacks (you can find replacement leverbacks in s/s for around $2.50 a pair shipped if you google it.)I got the earrings on sale, for less than fifteen bucks, so to me, it's worth the extra 2.50 to upgrade the earrings to the hangers they deserve.I'd recommend them highly - but I'd also recommend you get a pair of needle-nosed pliars and a new set of leverbacks if you want to keep the earrings!
",3
24051,"From the reviews, I expected this item to be quite nice but it was really ordinary and not something that I would wear. I kept it to give as a gift to a young niece. She'll enjoy it.The seller did ship it very quickly. No complaints there.
",3
24054,"I purchased this link along with 4 others. This one is very nice as are the others that match what I actually ordered. The company, however, sent one incorrect link and was completely unwilling to admit the error or to rectify the error. I was only able to get a refund after filing a claim with Amazon. I do not recommend purchasing anything from Pugster, but if you do buy with extreme caution.
",3
24091,"While I have been shopping for a very decent pair of diamond earrings, I was a little disappointed at what I received. Even though they were nice, for being 1/2 carat, they were very, very, small. I feel the price would had been somewhat reasonable if the diamonds actually looked like they were 1/2 carat.
",3
24101,"I used part of a gift card to purchase this ring. The card was a gift for my 75th birthday. It is an attractive ring, but not worth the price. It looks as if it could be purchased at a flea market for 10.00 tops. The advertising picture was better than the item. (First time this has ever happened, right???) Just sorry I used my gift money, but unfortunately, ""you learn by doing."".

24103,"This is a pair of really nice earrings. I searched a lot of stores and finally get one from Amazon.com for my anniversary. Although I have to wait over 4 weeks to get it, both my wife and I like it so much. It come with a pretty box and a certificate from International Gemological Institute. The whole thing is perfect except one problem.The only problem is that the back of one earring has some brown dirty rust-like things which is unacceptable. Another one has a very shining silver back. I have to return and get a replacement.

24107,"Overall... these were pretty good diamonds for the price. However, a big issues was that the cut was listed as ""Very Good"" but the IGI rating just listed it as good. I immediately contacted Amazon support and got quick feedback. They suggested ordering another one and returning this one. I did - with the same result.One of the big problems here is that you cannot speak to a jewelry rep. You get a general customer service rep immediately but they have to pass you info over to the jewelry department which can take a couple business days to respond - and only via email. This is pretty bad for a company trying to exceed customer service standards! Dont get me wront - their reqular reps tried to help but were limited in what they could do and the information they could get. Especially Jeremy - this guy was dedicated! But again, he was limited in what he could do because of the jewelry department.On my final email to customer service I noticed they took off the cut description on the website.Again... good diamonds and size for the price. I was a little upset that the price was factored on a Very Good cut even thought the diamond wasnt exactly that. My return was processed with no issues.

24120,"As can be the case with many jewelry items, the display sometimes far outshines the actual item, once received. The necklace is nice but somewhat lackluster and tends to fade into the background a little too easily.

The black looking one in the picture turned out to be a bright magenta, and the silvery ones looked just like plain white pearls. That was kind of disappointing, but it might've been only me that it happened to. Otherwise, I'm pretty satisfied.
",3
24184,"they just weren't as vibrant of colors as pictured. Maybe I got a bad set? The differences between the yellow, pink, and white were minimal. I kept them for a couple days to look at them and hope that maybe they'd grow on me, but they didn't. I'm submitting them for return, with the hope I'll find something here to take their place. On the other hand besides my disappointment with the color, they were good quality earrings.

",3
24632,"I want to start out by saying that the price can't be beat. I checked a local jeweler and he didn't have any diamonds this size for less than $850 a pair. However, stones put in white gold settings should have better color than this because of the contrast. The yellowish tint of the diamonds is pretty obvious. I would recommend that you buy a smaller, better-color, stone rather than these.

24729,"After our dog ate my mothers day bracelet, my husband offered to replace it. I decided to go simpler and choose this braclet.Now keep in mind that most of the jewelry pictures is no where near as large as it is pictures. This bracelet is delicate and rather light. The toggle clasp is not the best, as it fell off of my wrist several times. I had to take it to the jeweler to have a lobster claw clasp put on in it's place.I can't complain- it is a pretty, simple bracelet. But the clasp is just terrible.
",3
24731,"I bought this item for my girlfriend. It's been one of her favorites gifts she's gotten. Some bad notes about it is that it tends to fall off the wrist because the clamp is not totally secure. After a couple of weeks, the rope broke from the heart. Now it has to be fixed and safely secure it.Overall, the bracelet is a wonderful gift for its beauty but very fragile. Can break or fall off. Beware....2 months later.....she didn't know it, but it came loose and now....lost.But still would purchase it but send it to be fixed.
",3
24737,"I ordered this for my wife for her birthday as she loves heart jewelry. I thought it would be a double win since she also tends to have trouble fastening bracelets by herself (as we all do). However, when she but the bracelet on and began moving around, the toggle slipped out of the heart. Thinking it was a fluke, she put it back on and the same thing happened within a few seconds. The heart is a little too big and the toggle easily slips out with very little movement. We have another gold heart of a similar size that my wife plans on taking to a jeweler and have soldered onto the bracelet's gold heart in such a way that will make the opening smaller and keep the toggle in place.
",3
24744,"This is a very pretty bracelet. It was a little smaller then I believed it was and it was a gift for a friend who is not exactly small. I would purchase it for myself, but I would've liked a width measurement. Overall a good bracelet for a good price.

24792,"Solid 14k Yellow Pink Enamel Childrens Butterfly Earrings - JewelryWebThese earrings are very pretty, but one of the earrings was bent when we received them. My daughter was able to still wear the earrings, because we were able to bend it back to be straight enough to screw in the safety screw backs.. but over time the butterfly wing would bend forward and need to be pushed back. Eventually the pretty pink enamel on the wing broke off.. so now the earring had one pink side and one gold side... ultimately the wing snapped off and the earrings needed to be replaced. The good news is that these earrings never irritated my daughters ears because they are real gold as advertised.

But for her; she was not happy cause it just didn't look good on her Sterling Silver bracelet. I sent it back and ordered 2 others (Heart & Cross). She very happy now.If you aren't as picky as she, the Elephant is very lovely and I myself would have kept it if it had been for me. It's small & dainty just right for a girl who likes elephants or is a 'BAMA' fan. Has a good split ring on it to hook to bracelet which also is a plus..As for me I would rate it a four but since it was for my daughter I asked her to rate it, Sorry, she gave it a 3; Just ok.

24804,"I waited a long time for this little ring, and when it finally came I wanted to jump through the roof over it, but I just could not get up the steam to do so! This ring was not a complete disappointment but it was far from something I would proudly wear around if I was trying to pass it off as the real deal. For one, the sizing was off. I know I ordered my correct size but it was still a little too big. Secoundly, the dimound size was believeable, yet it looked a bit cloudy to me. The craftmanship was beautiful, but for some reason though it said .925 stearling silver it was a rusty color. Maybe that was part of the antique look, but I thought it was strange. Not a bad ring overall, but if you are looking for something to really pass off it's best to just buy it at a store so you can really see how it looks.

24885,"It seems like I waited and waited for this bead, but I really did not have to wait too long. I ordered it on the 1st and it arrived on the 6th. I was anticipating getting a nice large bead with a dark brown backgrownd with a Spiral blue line and a Spiral black line on it. That is what the picture looks like and what their description suggests. Instead the bead looks as follows: it is large, larger than most Pandora beads being 14 mm in diameter and 10 mm wide including the silver around the hole. Instead of being dark brown, it is a brown/gold color and intead of being dull, it is quite shiny. It does have a blue Spiral line off to one side as shown and it is light blue. It also has reddish purple line around it where the black line appears to be. In additon there are 3 pencil thin black lines going around the bead in the direction of the blue line. These lines are black. It is quite light when weighed in the palm of the hand. Some beads have substance to them in terms of weight, this one does not. Almost makes me think it is spun glass. So, if you are good at pictures in your head, you now have an idea of what the bead is really like. It is not necessarily a bad bead, but it is certainly not as pictured. I may send it back. It depends. I have ordered two more beads from them that are to be similar to this and it depends on how they look and how this one looks with them. I hope you have an easier time deciding with the description I have given you.

24907,"The quality is alright considering the price of the bracelet. The bracelet itself is a stretchy bracelet, the stretchy comes from a clear elastic like material the beads are threaded onto. The beads themselves were a little spotty and needed some polishing before I felt good about giving it as a gift. The dragonfly charms are cute, not the highest quality but cute anyway. The bracelet is made in China.I paid for priority shipping and it did arrive quickly, but not by any priority carrier. The package ( a plain envelope, the bracelet inside wrapped with a tiny single piece of bubble wrap) arrived by REGULAR USPS mail and the stamp on the envelope says 60 cents was the cost. Since the packaging was not anything fancy (barely adequate in my opinion) I am wondering what the very expensive priority shipping cost was for, other to make sure they send it out in a reasonable time frame. I had intended to order other products from this company but after paying a VERY overpriced S & H fee I will not buy from them again.

I called American Pearl and they said to send back the necklace and upon receipt they would immediately ship out the correct piece. I sent it back and according to FedEx tracking, it was delivered to their offices on Friday, May 5th. I called on Tuesday, May 9th because I hadn't yet received the necklace - only to be told that they would be shipping it out on Wednesday, May 10th - for delivery on Friday, May 12th!

Don't expect too much from this toolbox, as it is not rugged, but it sure beats carrying around a bucket or box w/o wheels.The new one I ordered from Amazon is the same box & handles. The color is reversed. Yellow for the base and black for the cover (as pictured). The old one, the colors were vice-sersa. The wheels are now some sucky wheel that does not fit well. It makes the tool box wobbly when rolling it around. I had to change it out with lawn mower wheels bought separately from Home Depot.Suggestion to manufacturer: change back to the original wheels on the older box.

It is not a true 8"" bracelet for two reasons: first, it only measures about 7.5 inches and second the lovely mesh is thick so it takes-up some length just because of the style.

25605,"I admit it I knew better. Just because all the multi-millionaires playing baseball wear these certainly doesn't prove they have any medicinal value. However if you want to wear one to look cool this is a pretty good price. For us bigger folks this one comes larger than most.

25614,"The product seems to be fine... I do notice a slight decrease in soreness while wearing this product. The only complaint I have as of right now is that the necklace is a bit stiff and wont lie flat around my neck. Tends to try and keep its oval shape. This may wear off in time. Great delivery time also.

I'm an international buyer so it's a bit expensive to return this item, however, I donated the 22"" one to a local charity sale. Since I can't wear this necklace myself I'm not sure if it works well, so this 3-star rating is given to the seller, for shipping a wrong item.

I bought mine knowing that it most likely wasn't going to work, but I figured that if it did, it would be nice. It is simple looking, and can be tucked under any shirt. I wear mine everyday, and I have noticed no change. I would recommend this for someone who wants to try something new.

25735,"I bought these earrings in the summer and loved them at first. When they arrived I must say I was littel disappointed in the quality of the earring. You have to be very carefully putting them on as they are fragile. If you can deal with that then they are okay. One good thing is they were delivered to me 2-3 days earlier than I had anticipated.

25883,"I'm kinda disgusted that this cost me $40. It doesn't even look like the one in the picture, its a uniform fake gold color, looks kinda like metal, and sounds like it, but is as light as cheap plastic.However, it is a decent replica (except for the back which is some weird Aztec symbol). I will wear it in public, but I seriously question the chain's durability. For as much as it cost though I will wear it a lot, those who love the movie will recognize it quickly I would think, but those who aren't that into it will most likely give me odd looks as I'm not the type to have anything to do with skulls. And I must admit, if you don't recognize what it represents it is a rather gruesome image. Honestly, not worth the money unless you are a huge fan of the movies.

25884,"I ordered this thing just for fun, but I gave it to a friend for a graduation gift because it wasn't what I was looking for.Pros: Looks okay, price was fair.Cons: DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE, smaller than the real prop, feels kinda cheap.If your looking for something to make a costume than this will do. But any self respecting pirate would try and find a better one. After all everyone knows the fake ones won't turn you into a skeleton at nigh, duh.

",3
25927,"The jewelry box is very cute and it's made to last more than a lot of other cheaply made boxes I've seen.However, the jewelry box is definitely more of a peachy-pink color (like the traditional ballet pink) and not a light pinkish/purplish color that's depicted. Also- there is hardly any room to actually hold the child's jewelry. Most of the space is taken up to compensate the little ballerina that spins around. There are two INCREDIBLY small drawers on each side that I just don't understand.I ended up returning it due to these reasons.But if you like the color (which my daughter likes blue and purple, so it didn't work for us) and don't have much jewelry, then it would be cute!
",3
25944,"Got this for my wife who had one as a child but it was destroyed and I thought it would be nice to get her one. She ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT but I take issue with the size.It can sit in the palm of my hand. It's about the size of those boxes used to store 3x5 recipe cards maybe a wee bit bigger but that's it and it's made of pressed cardboard so it's fragile and will warp/fall apart if it gets wet.My mother has one from when she was a kid and it's the size of a small/medium cookie tray. Guess they just don't make them like they used to.
",3
25947,"I purchased the ballerina jewelry box for my granddaughters, and they were entranced and delighted to see the little ballerina spin to the tune of the music. It is constructed of heavy paperboard, and will probably not hold up as well as if it were constructed of wood. This ""toy"" is not one that is meant to be played with in the traditional sense of the word play, but is to be enjoyed for the lovely artwork and the sweet music it plays.
",3
25949,"I SO want to give a four or five star review for this little ballerina box. It's gorgeous! The cunning little drawers! The sweet, soft ballerina paintings! It plays Swan Lake! But, oops, it DID play Swan Lake. The wind up mechanism broke after only a few days, and now the ballerina does not twirl and the pretty box is silent. My little girl still likes it, and maybe this is just the way of ballerina boxes, but I wish it were more durable.
",3
25950,"I purchased this for my six year old daughter for Christmas. I looked around a lot before making this my choice. I wanted a wooden jewelry box with more than one compartment, with music and a ballerina. This one is lovely to look at but I have to say, the drawers are a bit odd. The main compartment, the one hinged on top is fine, typical for a jewelry box. The drawer at the bottom is fine too but it seems odd that the entire front of the box has no compartments until you reach the bottom. I supposed it is to allow for a seamless picture of the ballerinas on the face but it makes for an awkward...really boxy looking....box. The little drawers on the side and back are long, narrow and deep. You have to really dig in with your finger to retrieve the items stored in there and my daughter has already gotten frustrated and turned the box upside down to get the items out. It has led to some tangled chains. There does not appear to be an artistic thought to the placement of the drawers. They seem to be just stuck in to the sides almost like pins in a voodoo doll. All closed up the box is very pretty but the only compartment my daughter really likes to use is the top one. If I had had the chance to handle this and really look at it in a store, I probably would not have bought it. The illustrations are lovely but the design is rather odd and not practical.

26089,"This multistone ring is pretty and I bought it to complete my set. I already have a multistone bracelet, earrings and necklace. It looks fine alone, but when you compare it to other pieces of multistone jewelry, the stones are not as colorful as they appear in the picture. Maybe I just got one that wasn't as colorful because it was on sale. I'm not really sure if these are available as ""seconds"" or not. All I know is that the green and yellow stones are especially hard to see and the other stones shown are much lighter than they appear in this picture. I guess you really do get what you pay for!
",3
26092,"I ordered a size 7 and this isn't a 7, it's some larger size, but otherwise is an attractive ring. It just can't be worn by the person intended unless we pay more $$$ to have it resized. We've ordered at least a half dozen various, other size 7 rings on amazon and other si tes, so I'd have to guess the sizing method for this specific ring isn't the most accurate.It's ended up in the ""pass it on to someone else"" gift pile. As I said, it's a nice ring; if you really like it and want to take your chances, go for it, but realize, there's a chance you won't get the size you're anticipating.
",3
26097,"I was looking at this ring for quite awhile. When it went on sale, I finally bought it. When it arrived and I took it out of the box, I was very excited - it is beautiful and stones are bright and colorful. But when I tried it on, I was somewhat disappointed. It looks chunky, not feminine at all, although it was right size. I tried it on with the matching bracelet (from Kohls) and matching earrings (from amazon). The flower on the ring is so much bigger than the flowers on the bracelet and earrings. It does not look like a set (I was confident it would). In addition, it is rough on the sides and uncomfortable to wear. I have not decided yet if I am going to keep or return it. Will look at it again tomorrow.
",3
26117,"I purchased this ring to go with my very pretty blue topaz earrings. The ring looks very nice, but the stone color is not like any of my blue topaz jewelry, more like a VERY light aquamarine, almost white! I am going to keep it anyway because it is a lovely ring and the price was right, but the picture is a misrepresentation, therefore only 3 stars.

26143,"These were okay but expected louder sounds. Would buy additional ones if there were more songs and they were a bit louder

26219,"I ordered this product to wear as a replacement for my old highly damaging metal labret horseshoe. When I opened the envelope I noticed that this body ring is much shorter than i am use to seeing for sale. Even with one bead exchanged out for a smaller ball this ring doesn't clear the top of my lower lip. I am not mad though. the bioplast already feels much nicer against my teeth and gums. the best part is that the ring is flexible and doesn't create much pressure on my lip. I am giving this a rating of 3 stars, the lost stars are for the shortness.

26247,"I loved this ring when I first saw it online and admired it for some time. Unfortunately, it was much smaller than it looked online and I was really hoping for a larger, statement type ring. I ended up having to return the ring since it didn't really stand out as I had hoped. If you however, like a smaller, more petite look, the ring is definitely very pretty. The color of the stone was very nice, clear and vibrant. I just needed something to really stand out in size and sadly this wasn't it.

They were a bit smaller than I expected but was giving them to an emergency room nurse and figured the size would be appropriate. The only dissapointment was when I asked them the next time I saw them they said the back broke off the first time they wore them. Guess you get what you pay for.

26406,"I was shocked at the quality of the beading in this necklace upon receipt. The color is gorgeous and pops against any solid shirt. Unfortunately, the first time I wore it, the chain connecting the necklace to the clasp broke. I did not bother to return it, which I will admit is my own fault. Overall, it's a great looking piece!

26410,"I purchased this to wear for a wedding, but the silver outshined the stones, which seems to disappear. I returned this item.

26424,"Placed order but wasn't able to review or track it afterwards. Seller's Amazon name (Old Glory) not the same as emailed notification name (Red Rocket Merchandising Corporation). Items (2 rings) arrived quickly in a plastic envelope. Items not exactly as pictured and not comparable to my existing ring. Competitive pricing compared to retail stores but I guess ""you get what you pay for"".
",3
26426,"this ring is just as advertised. however if you are a big & tall person like me, you should order this as a pinky ring and no other finger. i ordered this in a size 13 for my ring finger but the ""om"" symbol is just too small for my big fingers. i will either size down the ring i have to a pinky ring or order a second ring to fit my pinky which ever is cheaper. this is a very nice ring for the money. the ""om"" symbol itself is about 1/2 inch top to bottom. make sure to order the right size.

26446,"I ordered this pearl necklace, bracelet, and earrings set for my young daughter, who was very pleased with it. However, I have just noticed an incoherence between the impressive sales pitch for the set and the Product Specification which in this context seemingly points to a lesser value. Product Sales Pitch: White 7-8mm AAA Cultured Pearl Strand Princess Necklace 18"", Bracelet LS1R2 & AAAA Earrings LS1B Platinum Overlay CAREFREE Sterling Silver Set (which for some unexplained reason makes no claim about rating of bracelet pearls). Product Specification: lacks any reference to quality categories (in pearls, AAA and AAAA, in metals, Platinum Overlay, and makes no distinction at all between pearl quality between each item in the set.) I think it behooves Amazon.com to explain why these incoherence.
",3
26458,"The picture looks like a relatively classy earring. Not fancy enough for a ball or anything, but sleek and shiny to wear casually out to dinner or everyday swank. However, in person, these are about 1/4 inch in diameter, which makes all of the knotted look disappear if you are not way up close to these earrings. It's a blur of sterling silver, which is perfect, if that's what you want. Price-wise, I was expecting a bargain, but instead I feel like I got what I paid for.
",3
26480,"I gave 3 stars because I do not know what grade of pearls these are.The description starts by saying the pearls are Grade B. But it ends by saying they are Grade A. The seller, American Pearl, needs to clarify - in every case where these pearls are offered for sale on Amazon.com - what the actual Grade is.Thanks.

26516,"very nice ring on the outside, but the inside of the ring does not reflect the same craftsmanship on the outside. No one will see the inner surface of the ring when it on someone`s finger but it does deflate the overall satisfactions of the product. The price of the ring is very favorable and if it was made from a more expensive metal and had this quality of work put it, i will truly be disappointed but at this price, I have little room to complain. you get what you pay for and i do enjoy it.

26536,"I ordered this to wear on a necklace with other ""bootie type charms"" I have representing my 4 children. When I received it I realized that it was too small next to the others I have.It is very cute and would work wonderfully on a charm bracelet or on its own as a delicate necklace charm.
",3
26558,"This isn't a bad necklace for its price. However, I think it should mention in the description that this is a close-fitting necklace. It would probably be more accurate to call it a choker. If you're like me, you prefer a necklace that isn't quite so clingy.

26562,"Got mine by yesterday, the peach pair looks mismatched because one of the studs is much faint than the other one; it looks more like cream other than peach.

I've had good luck with this company, so I will order from them again; I'll just avoid anthing with candy pink shades.
",3
26602,"OK earings for the price but the ones I received were an odd shade of green. Be careful if you are expecting a pink pair of earings. Photo implies they are pink but there was only a small amount of pink in the set I recieved and the combination of those colors made the earrings look a little cheap.

26638,"Received it quickly but the ring had a few flaws. I could tell where it was pieced together.
",3
26737,"These earrings are nice, but the pearl is huge and super white. They are not as elegant as I was hoping.
",3
26741,"The best part of these earrings is that they are stamped 925 and are Sterling Silver. The pearl looks synthetic if you look close, but usually folks don't get that close so they work for almost any type of outfit. I think the price is little high, but I wanted that particular style earring and went for it. Packaging and shipping time were no problems for me. It arrived quickly and well packaged. I got these shipped free with the rest of my order; I wouldn't have paid extra to have them shipped.
",3
26795,"While I am happy with the quality of the pearl pendant, the chain is terrible! When I opened the box it was packed in, the sterling silver chain was filthy. It was so badly tarnished that I was not even sure it was silver. The chain was almost black in some sections and a brownish pink in others. I had to use silver cleaner to make it presentable. In addition, the clasp opening is so narrow that the ring at the end of the chain almost won't fit. It is a struggle to close the clasp. I bought this as a gift for my daughter and with Christmas being so close, I will give it to her as is, but I will most likely be buying an new chain.
",3
26836,"I thought it was big.the close up of the image makes it big.its ok though. nice design. its just not that thick.
",3
26859,"The bracelet is nice, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I was trying to replace a stolen Venetian Link Bracelet and the links are a little bigger than I had thought. Not a big deal, I'll get used to it, trying to replace something can be hard. The length was a little weird too, I never thought I'd need the 8 inch since I don't feel like I have big wrists. I was wrong. Oops. It's a little tight, but I can deal with that.The issue I had was that when I initiated a return I got NO response. That made me MAD. I would have exchanged it for the larger one, but I never got contacted and frankly I'm a bit of a bum and missed my deadlines with Amazon to fix it. All that did is leave me annoyed and bitter that I didn't follow up. All in all, it's a pretty bracelet, but the lack of service means I won't buy from them again.
",3
26870,"I received a very pretty red brocade jewelry roll. I like having the large open pocket as well as the zip pockets, so this roll can handle several sizes of necklaces. The snap holding the ring bar is good, but the zippers are a bit sticky and have to be handled gently.

26871,"This is an overall good product, however the way the picture is situated you can't tell that the design doesn't go all the way around. It also stays shiny for a while but then has be cleaned.

26874,"I got this for my husband because the style was perfect. However, I was soon disapointed because the ring is easily scratched which is a SURPRISE because its Titanium and I thought is would be durable. Also, I find this seller to be very defensive about customers' satisfaction. too bad.

26880,"A beautiful ring, I got it in August and by November it's become slightly tarnished. :(

26888,"The size and shape are beautiful, but after one day the side stones look dark with no shine. Not impressed.
",3
26889,"It's a very nice ring with a nice big stone but it doesn't have much sparkle to it. You have to get in just the right light for it to sparkle otherwise it's a fairly flat looking stone. I was a little disappointed in it and was hoping it looked a little more real.
",3
26904,"Very beautiful ring but just too big for my taste and hand. Would've kept it otherwise.
",3
26908,"The stone in this ring is far bigger than we anticipated and my wife doesn't like it because it is so big, it makes quite a flash, and since it is a CZ ring, she feels like it is trying to make a statement that we have more $ than we do.It is very pretty though, if you like big square stones.
",3
26921,"Before I ordered this charm. I should have got my measuring tape out. The charm is nice but it is very small. I planned to wear it on a chain. You can barely see it on a chain. I would like it a lot more if it were bigger or if I had a charm bracelet. Maybe now I need to get a charm braclet.

26923,"I purchased a Palladium ring elsewhere as my wedding band. I wanted something to wear when working with my hands, when damage to the ring is likely. I bought this, and a 5mm Stainless band. The stainless band is nicer for a few reasons. First, the silver color is beautiful but doesn't look like white gold/platinum/palladium, while the stainless looks very close. Second, the stainless is much more scratch resistant, this will scratch in the first five minutes you wear it. Third, the dome on this ring is very high which was uncomfortable for me. Fourth is that the silver is likely to react with some people's skin. I like the SS ring I also bought from Sabrina much better. If you want silver, this is it, but it wasn't what I expected.

I was looking for a two tone yellow gold and white gold style in this very ring but couldn't find one - so this one does nicely.

279,"I actually ordered these for a Halloween costume, but they're really pretty. They're a little more delicate than I thought from looking at the picture, but with normal wear I don't see that being a problem. Overall I was really impressed. The only thing I didn't like were the french ear wires... they made my ears itchy, so they're probably a low grade stainless wire. Not a problem if you don't plan on wearing them all the time.

284,"My grand daughter, as well as my daughter were delighted with this necklace. Beings as she now has so many Star of Davids to choose from, to wear, this is something different, and as Sarah say, special. The workmanship is very fine, and the only recommendation would be a better quality necklace part. The pendant is superb.
",4
286,"Nice necklace - looks great on my guy. And so inexpensive! Shipping is a little high for the size/weight, though.
",4
287,"Puns aside, these earrings are a great value, just the right size and the orange hue is beautiful. Count me a very satisfied customer.
",4
289,"I really love these earrings and wear them quite a bit to spice up work clothes.
",4
290,"I really like these earrings. The only thing to note is that the orange bead looks really fake (like plastic).
",4
293,"These earrings are long, the beads are larger than the picture makes them look, but that is actually a good thing in my opinion. They are more in proportion to my larger frame that way. I didn't think they looked too plastic, and I doubt anyone is going to get all up in my face and judge me for wearing plastic-looking earrings. I think that this pair is very becoming, the color draws attention to the face without making the face seem wider. Very stylish, especially for people with long dark hair, as they do not get lost by virtue of being so colorful. (Sorry for horrible last sentence, too sleepy to edit. Sawee!)
",4
301,"These are great earrings! I was looking for black dangle earrings, and the onyx & beads give them style. They can be worn with casual or dress. They are solid and substantial, but not too heavy.
",4
303,"My wife really liked this toe ring. She loves the way it looks classy and edgy at the same time. Trust me, it really is. People have complimented her on how good it looks from a distance, and then when they get close, they see that it is a skull and crossbones and they love how ""dangerous"" it makes her seem, all without losing any of her class!
",4
318,"I have been delighted with all of the lovely silver chains I have purchased from Gem Ave. Out of 6-8 ordered, only this chain arrived with 2 or 3 chinks. I called the company and the chain was replaced within 3 days without any hassles. The new chain was strong with a secure Italian lobster clasp. It had a lovely shine, without being ""glaring"" and artificial looking. It came in a small, wrappable gift box and will make a wonderful present paired with the silver pendant I have in mind. If it was possible to give a four and a half star rating on this product, I would have done it!
",4
320,"The necklace is a very pretty piece. It is great for pendants. Also, I really appreciate the quick shipping - I was able to wear the chain/necklace right away!! Thank you.
",4
326,"it has very little give in the arch. It cannot be bent like the picture, and would likely snap with that much pinch (or that forceful of a tug on your pendant). Otherwise, it looks nice.
",4
356,"I got 2 and stacked them with a plain band in between and it looks great! The design of the ring is so different and unique and so pretty!!
",4
357,"Cute, sparkly, right up my alley. Nice and inexpensive so I buy about 5 at a time. Cannot have enough! Good product and Serenity Crystal are thorough and fast shippers. (When one of the colors I ordered was out of stock they called immediately to see if I would like a replacement color. Love that customer service)
",4
368,"I absolutely loved this ring. The stone was gorgeous and even though the band itself was on the thin side, it was well done. My only reason for not giving it a 5 was that it was a little too big for my taste. It looks a lot bigger than 2ct. to me. I returned it for something a little smaller. If I was comfortable wearing something this size, It would have been perfect. I wish there were real photo posts for ever ring so we could see how it looks on someone's hand.
",4
377,"I ADORE IT! I HAVE A SIZE 5 RING FINGER AND IT LOOKS GREAT ON. THIS RING CAN FOOL YOU THAT IT COULD BE REAL. THE METAL HAS NOT TARNISHED OR TURNED MY FINGER COLORS AND SO I FEEL IT WAS A GOOD BUY.
",4
392,"For the price this is a wonderful ring. Very pretty. The band seems a bit thin, though, which gives it a cheaper look. Overall, an excellent bargain.
",4
395,"The ring is beautiful and is worn now for about a month. the metal is still shiny but I need to clean the stone. It's well worth every penny and then some.
",4
400,"I had bought this item for a friend. It was shipped to her and she said it was beautiful and she loved it. I never personally got to see it myself, but she was pleased, and that was the main thing I was concerned about. The delivery was prompt and the item was in good shape when it arrived.
",4
401,"Some will love this pendant and some will not. I like it okay. The design, while being interesting and unique and the sort of pose that is quite appealing, is not fulfilled in the quality of work. The mountain lion, for example, is not carved as well as it might be. So while this piece is interesting and appealing, it is not stunning.
",4
416,"Been looking for plumeria charms !!!!! This item is great & designlooks beautiful !!!
",4
428,"These are lovely dainty sparkling earrings. Great for day or evening wear.Just wish the packaging said Swarovski Crystal. It would be more impressive whem giving as a gift.
",4
429,"I ordered this as a gift for a very nice friend, it arrived on time and my friend loved it. I would suggest you to make it possible to have this item gift-wrapped or should come with a gift note. Still, they made a quick shipping and that's what matters. :)
",4
433,"I was a little disappointed that it was a bit scratched when I got it, but beautiful and exact to description/picture.
",4
438,"Such a cute little heart bracelet; I like it a lot. The color is beautiful and unusual.
",4
445,"The set was agreeable in appearance I felt they were exactly what I had been looking for. They came precisly as advertised I was happy for some weeks. But, just like the fire opal set I bought at the same time as these, something in my skin did not approve and I suffered itchy ears and red, scab like skin, underneath the place holder on the back. I can assume the place holders were of the same make as the stud itself, but something about the opal set and this set made my ears painful. I'll just save them and have them cleaned to give them as a gift to some one with less sensitive ears than mine.
",4
448,"I ordered this charm to give as a gift. Unfortunately, the charm was a smaller then anticipated and smaller than the photo so I felt a little cheezy and got an additional gift. Otherwise the product is as described. I had o problems with the seller and would order from the seller again. Delivery was quick and well packaged.
",4
455,"This ankle bracelet is not as dainty as the last one I had but it is going to hold up much better I beleive. It is cute and sparkly. Good value for the money!
",4
456,"This ankle bracelet is beautiful and was exactly as described.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because the ring that attaches to the clasp is not as thick as the rest of the anklet. I would hate to have this fall off!
",4
457,"got this for my friend for her birthday and she loved it! it looks good on fair skin rather than tan.
",4
466,"I bought this to bling up my ankle for summer short season. It is very sparkley & does not go unnoticed. The sterling pieces between the Swarovski crystals are tubes and it is all held together by heavy clear 'fishing line' type craft cord, and seems sturdy so far. The Swarovski crystals are clear but have the aurora borealis finish, so they flash a rainbow of bright colors. Very pretty anklet!
",4
473,"Loved this anklet as soon as I unpacked it! It fits perfect around my ankle and the crystals catch the light beautifully! It is a little awkward to sleep in since the stones are a little sharp (the only reason it didn't get 5 stars) but it's definitely an eye catcher!
",4
474,"I love this anklet, I was hoping it was flexible enough to use as a bracelet as well but its not. But thats ok, it will look great this summer!! :)
",4
475,"The anklet really is very beautiful and priced very well. My only complaint is that the Swarovski crystals, which are NOT as sharp as the ones I incorporate into my hand made jewelry, dig into my ankle. (I only wear jewelry that I do not have to take off, so the anklet is there all the time.)That said, I think in the summertime, this anklet is going to be gorgeous on my bare ankle. Now, though, while I am wearing thick socks and boots, the anklet gets pressed into several parts of my ankle, and at the end of the day, my ankle is bruised.
",4
497,"Beautiful ring. Petite looking on your finger because the 1.50 carats is hidden somewhat by the bevel setting. Good clarity and sparkle. Size runs a little big.
",4
499,"These earrings are nice for $5, but I wouldn't pay $20 for them. The longest dangle is 30mm in length, the middle one is 25mm, and the shortest is 20mm. The stones are 5mm. Unfortunately, the pair I received had the longest dangle in the front and the shortest in the back. They don't look good that way, so, with needle nose pliers and magnifying glasses, I managed to change them, so the shortest one is in the front and the longest one in the back. Since silver is soft it was very difficult to do without bending the earwire.
",4
504,"Granted, These are cultured pearls instead of their most expensive cousin ""sea pearls"". Still, This set looks Beautiful and if it WERE sea pearls, you could skip it and buy 2 honda cars for the same price. No kidding, if you dont believe me, look it up!I am fine with the fact that I will never be able to get REAL sea pearls but, these are SOooo pretty...they are like the silver vs platinum! ya know. So rate them so, i can buy them! lol! thanks!
",4
522,"I was not sure how the ring would look. The picture was ok, but could have given more detail. I found the ring pretty and I have recieved great reviews for the ring. Others thought it was a real Turquoise ring. I did not correct them. I plan on purchasing more rings as long as my size is available.
",4
527,"This bracelet was gift for my girlfriend who likes strawberries, she liked it very much (she's pretty blunt), the only thing is that it was a tad big for her skinny wrist, so she wears it as an anklet, but it is a good product for a good price.

532,"Once an athletic youth, non necklace wairing type, had no need for a seemingly useless necklace. Now over 50 type 1 diabetic, hypoglycemic unawareness is increasingly more prevalent. Today, this necklace quality and price is of greater value than ever. I received item as described, good quality for a reasonable price.
",4
540,"Bought along withDETAILED PATTERN Design Silver Tone Pewter FINGER Ring SPIKE. I received this finger ring today, and although it's pretty with a solid feel, it has two small problems (that were not problems with the other finger armor I bought).First, some of the black coloring used to fill in the crosses has been smeared onto the middle section. In my case, however, this isn't any huge problem, because the way the base piece overlaps, it's pretty hidden, and it's a line at the bottom of the base, so even if my finger is curled, you are more likely to see it as part of the design.Second, one of the hinges has already broken. Again, in my case, this isn't a big problem. It is one hinge on one side on one section, and since the other side is tight enough, it has not hurt my ability to wear it at all. This breaking is partly my fault, since it's pewter and I bent it too quickly, but if only the hinges were made of a stronger metal, while the rest of the ring still pewter, I can't help but think it's durability would be greatly improved. In fact, I'm thinking of looking through the crafts store to see if there aren't some types of jewelry fastenings that I can replace the weaker pewter pieces with.Overall, this piece is still gorgeous, and for the price, it's a good deal. Despite the minor flaws, I'll still wear it out, and I know I'll have more than a few friends who will love it.
",4
553,"Good value compared with other medical id's. Only suggestion for improvement would be bolder engraving of text indicating the medical issue. Existing text is readable but could be better at little cost impact.
",4
554,"The chain and medallion are stainless steel, strong and rustproof. You can get one listing whatever your condition is on the back, discretely. The chain is just long enough to fit over your head, removing the need for a lock - always the weak spot of any chain. My only criticism is that the red plastic Cadceus alerting paramedics of your needs fell off soon after I bought it.
",4
565,"Maybe this is standard for jewelry- but the ring is slightly different from the photo. Not quite as chiseled, and with some noticeable minor differences in the hands, heart, crown and in between. That being said, I love the one I got.
",4
574,"Bracelets were better than I pictured them. Good size and very good price.
",4
592,"Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this ring and this seller (Peora). The gemstone, Amethyst, is simply beautiful. It sparkles as brightly as shown in the picture. I'm really satisfied with the gemstone.However, the conventional wisdom of ""you get what you pay for"" rings true!! The only thing that I'm not happy with is the silver/metal of the ring. It's not exactly superior quality, or the 925 silver or pure silver or stainless steel that I'm used to wearing. The silver is thin and light and at a close distance, looks like plastic with the silver color sprayed painted on it.But since it's inexpensive and if you dont mind the silver being light, and plastic-ie, then this is a really great buy!
",4
604,"The ring looks great. My husband loves the quality. Our only issue was that the ring only came in one size.
",4
605,"Liked very much the unique design. The only thing is that the part that goes through the ear is very long. I plan on cutting off part of the length and smoothing the edge. But other than that, I really like them!
",4
616,"i love my bracelet, I wear it everyday. I like the old world look about it. The only drawback is the fact that pewter is a soft metal,& bends easily. I have to be careful not to push it too tight on my wrist. Love my wolf bracelet.
",4
623,"One of my friends has the same ring. I thought it looks really fantastic and I bought one for my self. I normally wear size 5 however the ring is really small, so I suggest to buy one size bigger. I sent the ring back for an exchange to get size 6, and I received the new one back really fast. It was impressive! The ring looks extremely shiny when you first get it but then it gets a little bit darker and looks nice.
",4
628,"Nice looking ring, runs about 1/2 size small. The ring looks nice, but isn't as well made as I was hoping, the mesh breaks and starts poking out after a few wears.
",4
633,"Beautiful. Looks great.The only problem is it's a bit ""long"". So, the cuffs will be a bit looser than you may expect.Still, I really love it :-)
",4
637,"I'm an anti-Twilight, but a big fan of mother of pearl. I was specifically looking for a small-sized MOP and I found it doing a search under jewelry. I didn't know that it was an EA celeb creation to appease Twitards. I like the asymmetrical band setting, but EA should tell fans it ISN'T a cabochon, but a FLAT MOP (the photo is a bit deceptive).

644,"Exceptional 3.25 carats total weight Round Shape Peridot Gemstone Pendant Necklace in Sterling SilverThis is a very dainty necklace. The quality is good and the coloris very consistent and pretty. Great gift for August Birthstone.

645,"I have always yearned for a pink diamond, but the price was to much for me. This one is pretty. Done well, can't wait to wear it.
",4
653,"Product was nice, just thought it was smaller. I was getting them for my 4 yr old daughter and when received realized that they were too big for her little ears - so I got them!
",4
658,"Small petite earrings, I found them in my gold box one day for $10 so I ordered a bunch for Xmas presents. I was impressed when they showed, they are petite, very cute, and the stones are beautiful. Not sure how they will wear yet, but initial reaction is ""wow"", nice bang for the buck.
",4
659,"I wish I had seen reviews before I bought these in October 08. VERY nice quality earrings, exactly as pictured, but much smaller and daintier than I thought. Very well suited for younger, pre-teen girls, or a woman with very short hair to show them off. My longer hair just hides them. But pretty earrings regardless, and nicely boxed with fast delivery.
",4
661,"I purchased these for a young lady (about 12)and they are adorable. I am sure she will love them
",4
669,"I like the iridescence of the earrings, but they are a little larger than I generally wear.
",4
670,"I purchase a LOT of jewelry and have done so for the past decade or more. Quite honestly, I think this pendant and chain are on the lightweight side. Had hoped the combo would arrive a little more substantial. If I had any assurance of finding something similar but more substantial, this would be returned in a heartbeat. Still pondering returning and what else I could do for my expecting step-daughter.
",4
684,"The perfect gift for a new mother! Item was exactly as pictured and described, and was packaged nicely in a gift box. The agate mother & child was a beautiful blue color with good contrast and nice detail. The sterling silver rope trim around the cameo was also a beautiful touch. Highly recommended!
",4
687,"It's a bit smaller than I expected. Also, it looks on Amazon like it has a glossy front, but it does not. The engraved image sits on top of the backing. It still looks nice, and my wife is very happy.
",4
690,"The rings arrived early and were in great shape. They are beautiful and it was easy for my fiance too!
",4
691,"Just as advertized and arrived before the expected shipping date. A pretty piece with dazzling gemstones in sterling. It is a beautiful necklace and I would buy from this seller again. Thank you!
",4
695,"The chain was kind of cheap, but the cameo was nice. A little lighter than I would have imagined... I bought it as a gift for a friend. She loves it.
",4
697,"These earrings are smaller than I expected, although they are actually the exact size of their image on my computer monitor. They are also not quite as pretty as the picture. There must have been some very good lighting for the display pic. I will wear them and enjoy them though.
",4
729,"Let me start off by saying ... I am a cow fanatic. Not in a sick way for you strange ppl out there.This charm is very tiny, about 1 cm in length and considering the size it's relatively detailed. Note the picture is a bit bigger than the actual item.
",4
733,"just the right size, well done, very clever, a conversation charm for any bracelet, granddaughter will enjoy it, I'm sure......
",4
768,"The nickel-free, sterling fiagaro chain was indeed in superb craftmanship. Light as a feather yet beautiful as a diamond. italian Fiagaro shows enough beauty when wored. It looks unique and expensive but to get these in store would cost from $39 - 113.00 depending the size length. It would been better if they had them here. Overall, beautiful and priceless!
",4
776,"I purchased this charm for my wife for Christmas. We have been married for 47 years and it brought tears to her eyes. She added it to her charm bracelet immediately.
",4
780,"I purchased these for my two year old granddaughter. They were the perfect size for her. The screw backs were great.
",4
796,"These are sweet little earrings, I bought them mainly because our daughter is 2 and likes to take the backs of her earrings off. In short, we have ended up with lots of lost earrings! These little guys stay on though. They have screw on backs that don't budge. It passed the toddler test and she has had them on for months with no issues. Cute little earrings for my princess!
",4
798,"These are pretty cute, but the backs screw on which is a little tough for little girls fingers to use.
",4
801,"These are cute and a little different from the run of the mill earrings you find for kids.
",4
802,"These are pretty, but they came loose not on a card, also, the backs aren't the nice round screw on backs that are on the other kid earrings, they looked like reg earbacks, they do screw on, but they dont protect baby from pointed earring.

804,"Pretty simple, nice belly ring but the stone is loose. Not great quality, but for the price it's fine.
",4
826,"I am collecting charms that have meaning for me. My mother was a terrific seamstress so this charm is a nice memory of her. I would have liked more detail on the charm.

837,"I purchased this for my neice and I'm sure she will love it. It is nice quality. A little smaller then I would have liked, but happy all the same.
",4
846,"my grand daughter who is 4 loved the story of the silver ballet slippers and is really into ballet, so she was thrilled to get this necklace. It is very small and dainty and would not work for a bigger kid. It looks a little bigger in the picture than it actually is.
",4
871,"I purchased this for my charm necklace. My son is a cancer so I wanted something to symbolize him. I gave it 4 stars only because the cuts on the stones were very uneven but I guess you get what you pay for. It is a very nice size.
",4
872,"I am always looking for ""special"" things for the grandkids. My granddaughter is born in July, i.e. Cancer and rubies. This charm is just perfect for her. Love it!
",4
893,"My niece asked me for a sapphire ring for her tenth birthday. It's not easy to find rings of good quality for children. This ring isn't a child's ring, per se, but it comes in size four which fits my niece's index finger and it will give her plenty of room to grow into it and even use it as a pinky ring when she's in college. The sapphire is small, but I think that's fine. It is proportional to the rest of the ring. The ring I received had a nice blue sapphire - clearly a sapphire and not muddy. The styling makes it wrap nicely around the finger and it won't snag sweaters like so many rings do. My niece and I both like the smoothness of the dolphin's body. It's a shiny metal that doesn't look like it will tarnish but it's too early to know. It cleans easily with a soft jewelry cloth and also responded well to very mild soap and water. This is an excellent buy.
",4
896,"The necklace is very pretty, and my younger sister loves it. The size is nice, and the package arrived on time.
",4
906,"I expected it to be a little heavier then it is -- but other than that I really like the ring.It sparkles on the hand and looks like the real thing
",4
914,"It is a very nice ring. The price was good and the ring is holding up well. I don't wear it every day but it is nice. I would recommend for anyone who loves rings like I do. q:-)
",4
918,"It is ok, nothing special, You get what you pay for. It is too small for my husband so I wanted to exchange it and made several calls and e-mails but never got a response so I just gave up. So I am hoping my husband can have it enlarged. So not real happy right now. Angela
",4
921,"I would have to say that this is the nicest ring for a guy that I have seen in a VERY long time. It's just beautiful. The only thing is..It gets dirty really quick and you have to watch what jewelry cleaner you use. The one we used on it turned it a gold looking color. Just be careful! You dont wanna ruin it!
",4
927,"I think the ring is beautiful, and so does the person I gave it too. Every precaution is being taken to avoid scratching, and after reading other reviews, we'll be taking that many more. I reccomend it, but be careful!
",4
932,"My husband gets compliments all the time. He beats his rings to death!! For the price I could careless lol!!
",4
938,"Ordered this ring for my fiance. We were both WOWed when we opened the box and saw how beautiful it was. We were both extremely surprised to see that the photo used on the website was no where near doing justice to this ring. It's a nice heavy weight, shines & we both love it! Just hope it's not as hard to keep clean or free-from-nicks-&-scratches as some other reviews here have stated.
",4
956,"Really awesome ring to give a gift. Shines brighly and the price is just awesome!
",4
964,"I wrote a review before and for some reason, I'm being asked to write another one. I really like the rings, both the men's and the women's!!!
",4
978,"Like the other reviews, i agree the material is soft, but it is a nice looking ring. I am very pleased with the order, but i wish the band width was the same all the way around the ring. It is about half the size in the back. I guess some people might really like this feature, but for me...not so much. You still can't go wrong on the price!!
",4
981,"I ordered these earrings, got them in excellent condition and were exactly what I wanted. I will definitely be considering ordering again. I was impressed with the prices as well.
",4
994,"*UPDATED REVIEW*When I initially reviewed this necklace, I was misunderstanding things a bit. The packaging of this necklace said the product was rhodium plated and I assumed I was paying for a piece of jewelry that potentially wasn't sterling silver. What I didn't know was that rhodium-plating is actually used on stuff like sterling silver, white gold and platinum because it adds brightness, shine and resistance to tarnish! Which is an added bonus, but it might be something to consider adding to the product description as a potential selling point so people who don't do their research don't make fools of themselves. :)This necklace is very beautiful and the person I got it for loved it!
",4
1011,"I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I was quite suprised. The pendant is the perfect size and very shiny. The chain is extremely delicate looking but actually quite sturdy. I have been wearing the necklace all the time (to bed, in the shower) and it is holding up nicely. I have already recieved a ton of compliments on it.The only negative - made in China.
",4
1043,"The silver charm is really sturdy, but the chain is a tad weak. And I bought this for my best friend shes kinda petite, so the chain did hang a little too low for our tastes, but just read the measurements on it to make sure youre happy with it.
",4
1045,"I got this for a friend, and I'm sure she'll love it. Although the chain is very, very dainty - The pendant hole is large enough where she could opt for a larger necklace if she chooses. So that's nice.It's very pretty necklace. Well worth the money!
",4
1053,"The wishbone charm itself is very nice and looks great on a different necklace. The necklace that came with the wishbone seems flimsy and not very attractive. Once the wishbone was put on a more substantial chain, I was very happy with the purchase.
",4
1056,"My granddaughter like it. She wore it to school and everyone thought it was really pretty and nice to get jewerly
",4
1057,"I wish the chain is longer and better quality . However it is good for the money we paid .Thank you so much
",4
1063,"Love the wishbone, thankfully I wanted to put it on a chain I already owned because it arrived with a broken chain!! Its larger than I had thought but still very nice.
",4
1065,"Got this as a birthday gift for a friend. The quality is very good and doesnt feel cheap, the wishbone has a nice feel. Would highly recommend this to anyone!
",4
1068,"Perfect as described and wrapped nicely. I thought it would be smaller or at least with more shape. It looks like I'm wearing a large upside down v. :/
",4
1070,"bought it for my best friend's b'day....i hope she at least like it..cause i absolutely love it..!and i thank amazon for such a great service..A recommended buy..! great value for price..
",4
1073,"For the low price, I wasn't expecting much from this necklace with wishbone pendant, but I was wrong. It's beautiful!! The necklace itself is dainty and lovely. The wishbone pendant is well constructed and the perfect size, not to big and gaudy! I also love the price of this item. I plan to buy a couple more to give as holiday gifts.
",4
1078,"The wishbone is pretty big, so pay attention to the size, but other than that it is very nice. The chain is very thin and tangles easily. I would recommend a colored cord instead of the chain for both practical and aesthetic reasons.
",4
1085,"I bought this as a gift for my niece and like it so much, I'm ordering one for myself .... Fun to wear and you can't beat the price - well made - makes a great gift for a teen girl or the young at heart!
",4
1090,"ordered this as a gift but had it sent to myself so i could check it out first adn it is beautiful. the wishbone is heavy and substanstial for a pendant, the chain leaves something to be desired-its thin and doesnt match the weight of the pendant. But i am very pleased with it and recommend it to anyone who is thinking about ordering it.
",4
1094,"This is a cute necklace but the wishbone is extremly lightweight. I thought it would be a little heavier than it is. I would like it so much more if it was a little heavier. It feels more like a little girl's necklace rather than an adults.
",4
1095,"For $15, it is a great deal. The pendant is shiny, but not fake looking. The chain is light and very feminine. The wishbone itself though, is pretty big and thick. I would not recommend this for a petite girl as the pendant might be a bit overwhelming. It does, however, make a hollow sound, and since it's pretty light, I assume it is hollow. Overall it's definitely a great everyday accessory, and at $15, definitely worth it!
",4
1096,"I liked this item online and gifted it to my wife. She really liked it and I was also quite pleased seeing it on her neck. The wishbone is little larger than a dime and very shinny. Its just the right size on neck.

1109,"Cute pendant. Chain is a little thin, but overall for 20 bucks, it will make my grandma very happy.
",4
1116,"Pendant is quality and as depicted in photos & description, 18&#34; chain is not - too frail for use with pendant.
",4
1117,"The necklace looks just like in the picture, I just wish they would packaged it properly (not in a velvet bag) that it doesn't tangle up like it did. It took me quiet a while to detangle it... I was so frustrated at one point that I almost sent it back. Because the chain is so delicate it takes a while to detangle.
",4
1122,"I wear this necklace pretty much every day. So many people have asked where I've purchased this, and I've received many compliments. Chain is a little delicate, but so far it's held up.
",4
1123,"Bought this as a Christmas gift; so recipient hasn't gotten yet; but am sure she will love. The chain is thin; but the pendant looks substantial and the perfect size.
",4
1130,"I love this wishbone pendant - just the right size, light but solid. The chain is very thin and is the right length for my decolletage. However, the chain has nickel in it as it causes a rash on my neck if I wear it for too many days in a row. If I didn't have a nickel allergy, I would wear it more often as it is perfect as an every day accessory.
",4
1135,"Bought this for my wife a while back. And she absolutely loves it. The finish on the pendant is really good. The chain doesnt seem to match it exactly, but my wife loves fine chains... so you see... all subjective.Overall a very good product for the price.
",4
1137,"I am pleased with this product especially for $15, it was just what I expected i love the wishbone:) The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the chain seems too thin and fragile but i may get another one for it. I have got compliments on it already so it's def worth the price:)

1141,"The necklace is very pretty and dainty, but the clasp is so tiny that it requires the skill of a surgeon to put it on. Otherwise, I love the necklace.

1145,"I love it . I wore it Thanksgiving and it is perfect. I also happened to have a set of wishbone earrings so this is great
",4
1163,"I bought four of these necklaces as gifts for my bridesmaids. The necklace quality was uniform for all four (there were slight differences between the stones, but as they are natural and not synthetic that is to be expected). The quality of all 4 necklaces was good, very pretty stones and settings and I really liked the box chain. The color is slightly more a green-blue than the royal blue in the picture, but still very pretty. Overall, great value for the price.

1182,"I have been eyeing the Sevillana ring for a few months ago, but I was scared to pull the trigger because of its very unique and bold design. When I saw this replica for sale for a fraction of the price, I thought it would be a good way to 'test drive' the jewelry before buying the real deal.I received the ring today, and I was impressed by the weight and look of the ring. You can barely tell it's a replica when its on my finger. However, there are 3 small differences that the buyer should be aware of:1. The inward facing parts of both the O and the band are hollow, unlike the real one which is a solid peice of silver. Of course, this is only noticable when the ring is off.2. There is no Tiffany stamp, but something illegible is stamped instead. It was probably supposed to be .925 but the numbers are all smeared together. I'm pretty confident it is real silver though only time will tell.2. The part where the band connects to the O is incorrect on both sides:- On the real thing, one side of the ring's band turns into a swirl that never conncets to the O (there is a gap between the two). On the replica, the swirly and the O are connected.- On the other side of the real ring, the ring's band is ""straight"" (no swirly) and fully connects to the O. On the replica, there is a swirly that is connected to the O just like it is on the other side.These differences are minor and barely noticable once the ring is on. However, the ring is lacking the detail that the original one has, which is shown by the shortcuts taken to manufacture this peice. Overall, the quality is great for the price and I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to shell out the full amount for the real thing.However, I was quite disappointed when I received it because its not the ring I actually wanted. The Tiffany Sevillana comes in two sizes: large (the original) for $325 and the small for $275. I was expecting the large but the one that is for sale here is actually the smaller version. Shame on me for not reading and verifing the dimensions listed in the description. Can't really be upset here because its my own fault, but be aware of which ring you're actually going to buy!Overall, I am impressed with Eve's quality and price (and super fast shipping!) and I will definitely be browsing more items to 'test drive'. :)5 stars for the experience as a whole, and this will make a nice present for my little sister.

1184,"beautiful, a little smaller than it looks, however it is a good quality. It made a great gift for my daughter.
",4
1188,"I got these for valentines day and I was a little disappointed at first when I first opened the box, but after wearing them out I changed my opinion of them. They definitely need some light to show the diamonds sparkle. They are very elegant and the length is perfect. The only down fall I think is the backs don't really fit the earrings. I had to use backs from a different pair. (but not a big deal).
",4
1199,"The color of the stones is a lot lighter than in the picture. However, it is still a very nice ring, so I am going to keep it anyway. At 40% off, it was inexpensive enough, and it goes with the equally pale stones in the matching earrings...
",4
1209,"Thanks, this product was just what I was looking for. My daughter really liked it
",4
1214,"Love this! I just wish I would have measured before I bought because it is a bit big! Would highly recommend this to anyone who is active and needs some reflief from the day to day aches and pains.
",4
1216,"I was skeptical at first but after wearing this since Christmas, I've noticed my neck and shoulder area is noticeably looser and I've been getting some colossal cracks in my neck. I work my upper body area in the gym and at home with various chest and shoulder exercises and I've found this helps take some of the post workout stiffness away. Would recommend to a friend.

1224,"I'v had this necklace for over a month now. I have had constant knee pain for 2 years . This product actually works. My knee pain is almost non existent. I also have a bad back. It has lessened that pain some what, but not totally . I would highly recommend this product.

1226,"PHITEN AQUA-TITANIUM NECKLACE bought one on a whim and it really works.no more neck pains in the a.m. and it looks pretty cool.just gotta remember to take it off before the shower it doesn't dry too quick!!

1230,"I ordered an Orange Phiten necklace for my kid. He loves these things, and it arrived right on time. The quality is just what was expected. The kid wears it every day.
",4
1238,"I purchased this for my husband. I found one in my town for 10.00 more, exact same product so this one is a steal! He liked it and has had no complaints, although the 18"" seems to be a bit smaller than that, maybe due to the thickness of the weave around the titanium wire. Good buy.
",4
1240,"I purchased this necklace in hopes that some of my daily aches and pains would lessen; I am still a skeptic by heart, and hoping that all my aforementioned A&P;'s would completely be eradicated by the wearing of this necklace seems,well,silly.It is comfortable to wear (although I do wish I had chose the next size longer for appearance sake.) and not at all heavy.All in all, I would recommend buying this piece to anyone who wants to give it a chance. If I am able to do cartwheels in a few months, I'll report back to let you know.
",4
1245,"It is comfortable and stylish but that is not why I bought it. I have neck problems and was looking for relief from low grade pain that often shows up. It seems to help although it is hard to tell with these things. Nothing scientific but I truly think it reduces and sometimes eliminates the mild pain I have had intermittently for a long time. There may even be a slight energy boost but that is minimal for me.
",4
1248,"So, my ankle has suffered for about 10 years or so. I have worn a goofy flat shoe that doesn't flex before. I got the necklace and double wrapped around my ankle. It started to feel strange(kinda warm) at first. My first thought was""oh great my brain thinks it is doing something"". After a while of not thinking or noticing it, i could walk upstairs without my ankle hurting. I am a sceptic, so i took it off for a few days. My ankle hurt again while walking upstairs. This is NOT a cure. When the weather changes like rain/cold, still hurts a bit. I got the cheapest one possible, but i am going to try the better one. While it does help, do NOT expect a miracle. It can help to reduce pain if double wrapped around wrist or ankle, but not a cure by any stretch. I like the product, but will have to get one of the braided ones to see more.
",4
1274,"I wear it mostly at night, or if I will be very active (skiing, etc.). Seems to work for me!

1285,"Nice necklace, looks great and fits very nice; it has a very good quality.I dont know if this helps at all with pain but it's still a great product.Very fast delivery.Highly recommended.
",4
1305,"I bought this titanium necklace just to try one more alternative treatment for my joint pains and was really pleasantly surprised. It seems to be actually helping. I take tons of supplements and use magnets as well as the Q-ray ring/bracelet but this is the first item that seemed to immediately help decrease the pain in my joints. I'll have to see how it fairs as time goes by but if constantly wearing a rather ugly necklace is the price to pay, so be it. I can't say it'll help everyone who tries it but it definitely seems to be relieving my joint pains. Yehhhhh.....something that REALLY works!!
",4
1307,"I am a chronic sufferer of back and neck pain. An accident several years ago left me with a fractured vertebrae and more pain than I know how to deal with. I watch a lot of baseball on TV and saw a lot of players wearing this and decided to give it a try. This product(along with a weekly workout regimen) has helped me deal with and exceed my own standards of pain tolerance. I don't know whether it's a mind-over-matter type of experience, but at this point, I don't really care. If you deal with aches and pains similar to these, I would definitely give this a try.
",4
1311,"I've been wearing it for 3 weeks now. I have sciatic due to a herniated disc. I was hoping this will relieve pain. I guess it's not that powerful to wear it on the neck to get rid of the pain in my low back. I also got the bracelet which really works for my wrist, elbo and shoulder. Well, it's probably the combination of the necklace and bracelet that make them feel pretty much pain free. They are painful because I am a Programmer and work on the computer all day.I would say this product works. I may be buying the waist belt that is not sold here.

1335,"I bought this ring with one in pink cubic to wear everyday. With two kids at home I don't wear my wedding or engagement rings because they leave scratches on the kids. I bought these two rings because they are my kids birthstones and I love them! They are comfortable enough to wear on my right hand and I dont even know I have them on. I agree with the reviewer who said that they were a little bit big but I just wear them on the next finger.

1371,"Loved the music box, and it was in fine condition - but the shipping wasn't good. It took a long while, and the box the music box came in was smashed and unusable. It was shipped in a puffy envelope, not a shipping box- horribly poor shipping in my opinion. But the item itself- discounting the shipping- was fine.They need to ship in the future in a box with good packing materials, not mail it in an envelope!
",4
1373,"I bought this music box for my 4 yr old daughter. She loves it !! It is perfect for her little hands to hold with out dropping. She loves that it lights up when she opens the lid. I am very happy with what I got for the price and I will more then likely buy more from the collection.

1394,"Purchased this small ballerina jewelry box for my granddaughter's 5th birthday. She was fascinated by the revolving ballerina and of course it came in her favorite color, pink! Recently the children in her class at school were asked to bring in something from home that made them happy and she chose the little jewelry box!!!
",4
1395,"I got this for my 3 year old Neice for Christmas. She was fascinated by it, and was still playing with it the next day. It was pretty durable as she slammed the lid and grabbed the Balerina a couple of times. I am not sure how it would hold up with a younger child. It was a great, affordable gift.
",4
1402,"I got this jewelry box as a gift for my 3-year-old niece. She absolutely loves it! It's not the highest construction, but it's solid enough for everyday use. She did flick at the ballerina, which made it stop turning for a moment. Winding the box again solved that problem. The winding mechanism is a little hard for 3-year-old fingers, but she was able to give it a small turn - enough to satisfy her attention span.
",4
1407,"I got this as a gift for a friend that collects music jewelry box. It is in fact bigger than the picture shows. I find it very cure, and my friend also like. It is adequate for a young girl's first jewelry box.

1430,"I'm not exactly sure how to review an engagement ring setting, but here goes. Its a fairly affordable platinum setting. I bought it as part of the engagement ring for my (now) fiancee. The setting is shiny and heavy just like it should be. Its a little bit on the heavy side, which is a side effect of choosing platinum rather than white gold, but it won't dull as much. My only complaint is that Amazon didn't offer rings in quarter sizes. However, rounding to the nearest half-size didn't make a big difference and the ring looks great on my fiancee's finger.
",4
1453,"Got 'em for Christmas. I was surprised that the bale did not ""dangle"", and the diamonds are of inconsistent size, (not visually balanced between the earrings), which I expected for the price. Very high quality regardless. Wish they had the option of yellow gold.

1458,"The Wolfwood Cross Punisher necklace is amazing. Once I got past the initial awe of having it right in my hands, I was dazzled by how well detailed it was. The designer kept everything, including the skull-shaped handle in the center of the cross, and little dots along the cross where the nails were. There were only two problems I had. 1: I'm not a Christian. Ever where I go people were asking me if I'd become a Christian, so I had to stop and explain the whole story behind me getting the necklace. My grandparents are Catholic, so they were thriled when they saw me wear it. (I didn't have the heart to tell them it was from an anime show) Problem 2: It snapped in half. I have to go and buy a new one because after almost a year of the cross going from neck to pocket and back, it broke one day. So be gentle, because even though it's a high powered machine gun with the weight of God's mercy, it's not the sturdiest thing around.
",4
1459,"I bought this having a much different image in mind. It's made with durable, heavy metal. The detail is beautiful, but the back side is dissapointing. There is no detail whatsoever on the backside, just a flat surface. It doesnt look anywhere near as cool when the cross flips over and all you see is the flat side.The chain it was on was very nice, and it looks very durable. If both sides had been detailed so beautiful, I would have given it a 5. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but it could of been better.
",4
1460,"I bought this just because I wanted something to remind me of the Trigun series besides the series themselves. I like the detail and the chain but I was expecting it to have the same amount of detail on the back of the cross. It's nothing more then a flat smooth piece on the back.
",4
1463,"I bought this necklace at an anime convention. Beautiful necklace. My only problem is when I let my brother wear it, it looked like he was wearing a chocker. The chain is too short!
",4
1493,"Received this the other day, used a promotional certificate so total cost was about $40 versus the $60 sale price, which was good deal. It is very dainty but pretty. The size is just right for the ankle at 9.5"" so there is extra room versus the 9"" anklets which can be tight on medium size anklets. The mix of white and yellow gold gives it a nice effect. Have not worn as this will be for the summer, but think this is a different style for your anklet and can be mixed with white and yellow gold accessories. Definitely recommended it for a different look.
",4
1494,"I purchased this as a gift for my niece, and was very pleased with the design and the quality. Very pretty and feminine, nice workmanship and a nice chain. The colors of the cz's might be a bit brighter than shown, but otherwise it's pretty much what you see. The only concern I had was with priority shipping. When I purchased the item, the seller's comments guaranteed delivery before Christmas. I didn't receive a shipment confirmation from the seller (Netoya), but what I did receive was warnings from Amazon that the item might not arrive before Christmas. I never received a reply from the seller after requesting assurance about shipping. Ultimately, the package arrived in plenty of time -- just as originally promised, and all was well. So, customer service might be iffy, but the product is nice.

1497,"The anklet is so darned cute, but I think it was overpriced. Otherwise I would have rated it a 5.If I had the option of handling the item, I would not have made the purchase at that price.

1529,"24"" 14K gold chain was a gift for my boyfriend. He likes it. The length was perfectly described. The only problem I had was the blue velvet pouch that it came with, it was awkward taking the chain out of the pouch (snagged a little), but other than that, great gold box buy.

1543,"I really like these earrings, they are beautiful and the length is perfect. Unfortunately I have to return them as one of the leverback hooks is twisted and the pearl does not hang correctly. Just got them yesterday and so disappointed as I was looking forward to wearing them. However the packaging is superb.

1548,"My wife was in need of a larger chain for one of her precious pendants. She noticed what my sister had one and told me she just loved her chain. As a husband who rarely notices some else's jewelry I search the internet for a cut diamond chain since I did not have time to go the retailers. I ordered it and the shipping time was only about four days, not seven to ten days as advertised.The wife was elated and it was exactly what she wanted. I turned out to be a great Valentine's Day. She still brags about it.

1559,"For the price, it would have been nice for it to have been 3-D. It's nice sized and very pretty, but feels a bit flimsy. This is a review, not a complaint. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this charm...I'd just have been happier to have gotten it at a lower price.

1593,"I may not be a jewelry expert, but I was desperate to find a 20"" chain to wear with a new opal pendant and could not find one, affordable or otherwise, locally. This chain is beautiful! I have big, clumsy fingers and so don't find the lobster clasp any easier to use than a ""normal"" clasp, but the chain is silky feeling and has a stunning shine to it. The price was fantastic as well! If it is available in other diameters, I will buy more. Thank you Amazon! Once again, you have exceeded my expectations!

It's small so a bit harder to use than a purely functional whistle, but since I was wearing a whistle full time it's much nicer to wear and does the trick.Has a nicer sound than some inexpensive whistles I've bought, just takes practice getting my lips set ""just so"" to get the best sound. Does exactly what is is designed to do.Still wearing, using and enjoying this whistle in 2011. I wear it as jewelry and use it almost every day on walks with the dogs.

I was very happy with the company, Cool Styles! Of course it's hard to buy jewelry without seeing it and trying it on. This band is a little thinner (thickness wise) than I thought it should be.

I like them.I bought them as a gift, so I haven't actually tried them on myself, and the only thing I might change about them is maybe lowering the location to more center of the heart on the back, so less of a chance of them flopping ( pointing downwards ) when fastened on the earlobe.

Well, you don't have to fret...you can still manage to be the 'hot mama' you once were BC (Before Children) with this belly button ring! It's awesomely easy to size and extremely comfortable! I was able to wear it all the way up to delivery, and would have kept it in if they could have somehow scrubbed it in for the C-section. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 is because at first after I cut it to the right size, it was a tad bit difficult to screw the little ball on...but that is basically because putting on ANY jewelry when you're pregnant is rather...trying to say the least...but trying to line up a little ball on a little flexible 'stick' while trying to screwing it on straight at the tip of your bulging (and kicking) belly is a feat even for pre-preggo's. Other than that, it's a definite 'must buy' if you wanna keep bringing sexy back while you're pregnant :o)

1837,"I just bought these for my moms for mother's day and they both Just loved them. They really were gorgeous.
",4
1854,"They did have the backings with them by the way :-) These were nice pretty earrings for the price, the only thing I didn't like was on the back of the earrings where the mother of pearl is, you could see a little glue.
",4
1858,"I had an allergic reaction to it. Some sterling silver causes me to have an allergic reaction depending on how and where it is manufactured.I love the bracelet and am going to try using clear nail polish on the inner surfaces that touch my skin, hopefully that will work.
",4
1867,"I bought these earrings for my daughter for her birthday. The Garnet is very pretty and shows up well. These were a great value for the money and my daughter wears them often.
",4
1868,"I was pleasantly surprised - my first on-line jewelry purchase. These are very pretty and elegantly packaged.
",4
1889,"I love this, but it is quite delicate, you must be careful with in when wearing it, perhaps it would have been better as a bracelet instead of an anklet. The service was great and it was shipped in a timely manner.
",4
1892,"Chain is very sturdy. Disappointed in ""chim bells"" on it. They jangle rather than chime. Not what I was looking for.
",4
1899,"Beautiful ring with a striking setting--the prongs make the ring look medieval.But, (there always is a ""but"", isn't there?)-- the prongs seem to catch on almost everything they touch. So you have to be very careful if you are goimg to wear this ring out and about. It is rather disconcerting to keep checking the ring every few minutes, just to make sure you have not displaced the stone by catching the prongs on some such materisl.I would not buy another ring with the same setting--although the setting is attractive.
",4
1903,"This is a beautiful necklace, and looks like it's made of good quality materials. I haven't had it long enough to testify to the longevity of the piece, but the chain is surprisingly sturdy, and the stone is securely set. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars is the size. The description is a bit misleading. This pendant is TINY. Really, really tiny. It is just over half an inch long, and unless you read the description at the bottom, the picture at the top next to the measurement is inaccurate, at least according to my ruler at home. But it is definitely worth getting, especially at such a great price. It would be a perfect gift, too! It is pretty and shiny and just a really nice looking little piece.
",4
1923,"I ordered theses earings and within a day they had called me to tell me that they weren't avaiable. The customer serveice rep i talked to was very nice and let me pick out different ones over the phone that were slightly more expensive. He wanted to charge me the difference, but did not after i pointed out that was no good. The earings i recieved are okay, but not great. They looked nicer in the picture. I'm rating this 4 stars instead of 3 since they were so nice on the phone. The product shipped write a way and i got it when it was promised.
",4
1924,"I was looking around to buy a heart shaped pendant in white gold, and after extensively and carefully reviewing all my choices, I opted to buy this one. I have to say that my now fianc&eacute;e was very pleased and was exactly what she was expecting. She wears it daily on an also white gold chain. I'll try to include a close up of this pendant taken when my girlfriend was wearing it.
",4
1930,"This bracelet is a good value...the gold is very thin though so I'm very careful not to twist it. The colors of the jade are very nice and go with all outfits, so I wear it every day.
",4
1965,"Looks better than the picture on line, size is good match to my normal size. Love this ring ,would buy others like this.
",4
1974,"Just got this last night and the color is true to the picture. Size felt a little big but not too bag. The stone is a little smaller than I expected, but not too small.
",4
1977,"The ring is beautiful--my colleagues complimented me on it right away. The setting is simple but sturdy and well-made, and the stone is large, very clear, and well-cut. The color is paler than on the picture, which is the only thing I can comment negatively on. In all other aspects, however, it is a very pretty ring that I would be glad to wear everyday.
",4
1984,"I buy this for my daughter. I was tired of her fingers turning black from 'cheap' rings. This was a great way to buy a nice ring for her and not have to worry if she lost it.
",4
1991,"Is there any way I can get the ring in a larger size than what you have offered? If so how can I order it in that size
",4
2000,"the ring is really very pretty but it doesn't have the weight of a real quality ring...but hey they are so inexpensive you can get several and have quite the collection of jewelery...and the choices are plenty on style, etc....i will be getting more!
",4
2003,"Purchased two, one for each twin daughter as a special 50th birthday gift. Would have preferred not made in China but didn't see that during purchase process
",4
2004,"Got for a Teen girl she seems happy with this, got the matching earings and necklace liked both of those also.
",4
2007,"I received this very lovely ring and was thrilled with the color and style. The only concern I had is that the ring seems slightly big for the size i usually wear. I would purchase more jewelry from amazon again after this experience.
",4
2015,"This is a beautiful ring, the stone is gorgeous. My one gripe is that, in person, the stone looks much larger than in the picture. I have very small hands and this looks a little silly on my fingers.
",4
2020,"I ordered the wrong size but that's not the seller's fault, obviously. Other than having to wear the ring on my index finger, I'm enjoying it. The stone looks bigger on my hand than I'd anticipated but I'm getting used to being ""ostentatious"".
",4
2028,"I received this ring today and am pleased with the purchase except for the color. The blue is paler than the picture. Nice solitare with a simple band for an excellent price.
",4
2030,"I agree with the reviewer who said this ring is pale. It is not as deep a blue as you would see at a jewlery store or even Walmart (I went there yesterday to compare). However, I like it. It is still a pretty blue and large, although not large enough to look tacky or anything. The mount is strong and sturdy, and holds the stone well. All in all I am glad I purchased this and will continue to wear it with my favorite blue sweater!
",4
2041,"The studs on the back of the locks are very long. They need to be cut down a bit to be comfortable. My GF had to do that she never takes them out.
",4
2044,"Nice earrings and I've gotten compliments. I'm a 20-something male, by the way.But be warned: quality is not that great and they are definitely overpriced.
",4
2049,"I guess I didn't realize how small they were when I ordered them, they're studs. My girlfriend loves them though. So... I don't think the size matters.
",4
2057,"Beautiful earrings, you can wear them with everything, they are just gorgeous! Pearls and brilliants combine perfectly well and illuminates the whole face. The only but is that, after a while, they are a little uncomfortable. And it is not a problem of weight, because they are very light. Perhaps it is the closure system. Anyway, they are fantastic!
",4
2063,"Its a nice bracelet but unfortunately, the safety-clasps does not work too well. I am certain that if i dont have it changed, it will come off without me knowing.
",4
2072,"These earrings were a little flat for my taste, but at the price, they are worth the money and silver is always versatile.
",4
2079,"I purchased this necklace as a gift for my girlfriend for Christmas. I was skeptical as I've never ordered jewelry on-line, but I must say that I was very pleasantly surprized. It was well worth the money and even cheaper and of higher quality than anything I saw at the mall or other chain jewelers. The pearls were a little on the small size but again for the price you just couldn't beat it.
",4
2090,"This is a classic. Very simple in design, the setting does not appear extremely attractive from above (the wearer's perspective), but is very nice from afar. This would make a great 'first dance' gift or a special birthday present to a special daughter.I received a white pearl with excellent luster and smooth surface -- no blemishes at all. The chain could be a bit more resilient, but for the price, this was a great deal (1/2 price deal!).
",4
2091,"The pearl itself was excellent, as was the rest of the hardware around it. Bu t the chain was a little too, uh, petite. I gave it to my mom as part of the birthday gift and I have no DOUBT that she won't be able to wear it anywhere NEAR her granddaughter. Plus the fine chain and tiny lobster clasp make for easy knots and difficulty putting on the chain. It is pretty, but I expected something a little different.
",4
2103,"I bought this along with several rolo chains, mainly out of curiousity for the style of the links. This is a slightly heavier chain at 1/8"" so not the typical chain for a pendent, though it certainly would be nice with the right one. The links remind me of soda pop tops linked together. That's not to imply it's cheap looking, in fact it's very nice; just a bit different. It's a good style to wear alone, or with several chains of varying lengths together. Overall I liked it. The 4 stars are for personal taste only. I prefer the spiga and rolo chains a bit more.
",4
2115,"The bracelet was stiff at first but wearing has loosened the links. The stones are uniform in color, pale purple.....go very well with lavender colored clothes. Sweet. It arrived VERY quickly!
",4
2121,"I actually bought this planning on only using the chain. I broke one of my necklaces and needed a rather thin chain, and this was cheaper than just getting the chain alone. I figured for this price, no way the pearl was going to be any good. I was wrong. It's no mikimoto, but the one I received was a good looking pearl. Well worth the money.
",4
2124,"I purchased this recently after reading the previous review by the other customer. I agree that the chain is fine for the pendant...but if you like me purchased the item mainly for the pearl (as I have other chains that I can -and have- tried it on) then there is no problem. I have saved the chain to use with other smaller pendants that I have and used the pendant with a slightly thicker chain. It is slightly bigger than I visualised (a miscalculation on my part) but still looks ideal with the pair of earrings I wanted to match it with. Overall a good buy..pearl acceptable quality. No problems so far.
",4
2130,"I really like the way this ring came out - it's very true to the picture. If i had to say one negative thing about it, it would have to be that getting the ring on is a bit of a challenge! It's not quite a smooth procedure, and every time I go to put it over my finger, I feel like I'm going to grind the finish off. However, it's still holding up and it looks really good. This is a nice every day ring that goes with anything.
",4
2133,"I like these type of wedding bad rings. This particular one is well worth the money. It looks nice and teh gold color is very bright. I am not sure how long the plating will last.
",4
2139,"The 14K gold necklace is a bit thin, but matches well with the pendant. It is a great price for such pendant and with diamond accent. You shouldn't go with anything smaller than 6.0-6.5mm; this is the ""starter"" size (I bought this with the matching earrings for my boyfriend's mom as her birthday gift, and she loves them.)Pros:Perfect size pearl for everyday outfitThe tiny diamond adds a touch of ""luxury""Cons:Mine is a little loppsidedOverall, good buy
",4
2141,"I love this pearl pendant necklace. It is very delicate, not overbearing. This necklace can be worn with just about anything. I purchased 3 for my bridesmaid's gifts. Very nice, for the price!!!!

",4
2201,"I specifically purchased these because of the backs. They are exactly what I expected. The weight of the earrings keeps me from wearing them more often. My ears are not used to wearing anything this heavy. The seller is a five star merchant. But I'm going to give the product four stars for no reason other then the weight.

2202,"Ordered these for a wedding...they are great and I am now back to order a second pair for a friend.
",4
2217,"I had been looking for bags that I could use to help make the jewelery that I can send more decorative.These bags are perfect for rings a small necklace or a small pair of earrings. They tie up very easily. And they where very affordable I searched everywhere for these bags and this is where I found the best deal for my money
",4
2219,"Good colors, variety of tones and it was perfect for small beads or earrings. They are not big enough for larger jewelry though.
",4
2236,"I put this item on my wish list and my boyfriend bought it as an anniversary gift. I love this necklace; it's simple enough to go with any outfit, and pretty enough to be noticed. I was not at all disappointed by the size of the pearl-all I had to do was read the product information to know what to expect. This necklace is perfect and exactly what I was hoping for.
",4
2237,"Beautiful necklace! Pearl has a very nice luster. Was very pleased with this item.
",4
2238,"As promised--I returned it for an 18 inch. Seller lost my return info in the mailroom, so didn't know who to send the new 18 inch chain to--taking over 2 weeks to get the new one.
",4
2239,"It may just be my stupidy but a 16"" chain is only 8"" around once clasped!I bought this for my wife as she needed a longer chain for a pendant she owns. I figured 16 inches should be long enough but alas, it's more like an ankle bracelet! It's 16"" if you unclasp it and lay it out! Hook it and it won't go around even a childs neck! Lovely chain, just watch the measurements!
",4
2240,"I am not one to order jewelry online, and had second thoughts after I ordered this necklace, however upon receipt, I was more than happy with the quality. My only criticism would be that I felt the chain was a little light, however I find this in much jewelry these days. Overall a good product for a good price with the usual prompt Amazon service.
",4
2244,"I like to wear this almost every day and it goes well with the pearl earrings and diamonds that is also offered in Amazon's store. Makes a nice set. However, the chain was much thinner than I expected, which worries me when my 1 year old grabs a hold of it.
",4
2246,"The chain could be a little thicker, but the pearl is very nice and the diamond is a good size.
",4
2248,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry! I am really pleased with it! I had done a lot of research online about pearls, and was originally looking for an Akoya pearl pendant, but this one seemed a good alternative (and better value) for its size. I was very pleased with the quality of the pearl - it's difficult to believe that this isn't an Akoya. The pearl has a BEAUTIFUL luster (the product description describes it as medium-luster...but if this is medium luster, it is MORE than acceptable to me), and has no blemishes, as far as I can see (I did look very closely under bright lights and unless I look with a magnifying glass, I don't expect I'll see anything significant, and anyway that really seems like overkill). Also, the diamond is very bright and very clear, not too small to be overlooked but not too big to overbear the pearl. I like the pendant so much I honestly would have given this 5 stars, but the chain the pearl came with was a very minor disappointment b/c it is a little too thin for such a substantial pearl and seems kind of delicate, especially if you have young kids who might want to grab at it. Nevertheless, this would make a lovely gift, also b/c Amazon sends it in a very nice blue-velvet box - it makes a very nice presentation.
",4
2249,"Purchased as a Valentine's day gift for my wife --the item arrived promptly (as always w/ Amazon) and was everything the description said it would be --the pearl is well shaped, has good color and arrived in a nice gift box w/ complete care instructions. My wife loves it!! I have purchased DVD's, books, tools and jewelry from Amazon --everything has been exactly as described and has arrived BEFORE promised. They are my e-tailer of choice.

2281,"I have bought a 14"" omega chain which is good. Unfortunately, there is no alert that the 14"" size chain is is intended for children. I know its not the sellers' fault but mine, however, seller should alert the buyer that the size 14"" chain is not intended for adult.Its beautiful.
",4
2292,"I ordered this necklace for a young girl to hold a little turtle pendant I purchased for her. The pendant has some weight and does come with its own chain, but I thought the omega would give this young girl a different, but still delicate look. She will be able to use this chain with any pendant she may have or receive in the future. It's a sweet necklace that, once she grows out of it, can be passed on to one of her younger sisters. I was pleased with my purchase.

At first I was worried about the ring being brass, but it still looks quite nice, and the brilliance of the pink-ice stone dashes any bias one may have about brass.The cubic zirconia stone is a hefty 1.5K. I was quite delighted to find that the stone has lovely deep facets that show hints of lavender. Wonderful. Well worth the sale price!

2360,"I really like this little pendant, but I certainly expected it to be at least a little reddish, as it seems in the photo. Mine, at least, is a pale purple color with not a hint of red. I definitely like it, but I would have ordered an amethyst if I had wanted purple.

2374,"I bought these earings for my 2yr old dtr. I think they were excellent value for money and small enough so her tiny fingers cannot pull them out. I would only recommend them for small children as they are very very small. All the same,I do like them!!!!!!!

It is a dainty but pretty pendant, and my daughters have worn them so much since presentation, I know they mean a lot to them ... this pendant can be worn with either very dressy or even very casual clothes, and is striking to the eye in either case.

2413,"I bought this item as a part of a 3pc set for my mothers birthday......While she loved the earrings, I myself was a little disappointed with the look to the earrings on two fronts. First off the earrings look stiff, I expected them to dangle a bit but they're straight and stiffer then a stiff on in the morn -_-. and secondly, the color of the chips were really light compared to the other 2 pieces.But all in all my mother didn't mind, and she was quite moved by the gift.
",4
2414,"I gifted these to my friend. Luckily for me, she loves purple, so she loved it. Its delicate and very pretty. Would go nicely with a dress or even jeans. Hopefully it wont break easily, cant tell.

2417,"I bought a pair of these earrings for myself about 5 months ago. They are still in excellent condition, despite multiple wearings, and I am very pleased with them; the silver is still bright and untarnished. I bought three more pairs to give to relatives this Christmas, and they are also delighted with the earrings.The reason I did not give five stars is that the earrings do not look like the picture. Like another reviewer commented, the earrings I received are all the darkest purple; there is not the lovely gradation of tones shown in the photo. Furthermore, the earrings I received do not have the variation in stone shape shown in the photo. It may be that each pair is different, and I just received several similar pairs by coincidence.However, like I said, I am pleased with the product nonetheless, and the price is unbeatable! I would buy more of these.

2430,"I ordered these for my mom's birthday last year. The expected delivery date was on her birthday, but they ended up coming a few days after. Other than that, they're very pretty and my mom loves to wear them. The stone color definitely varies.
",4
2446,"These earrings are cute but they are not what I expected. From the picture it looks like they are almost two-toned. I thought half of the heart would be shiny and the other half would be a darker silver--that's why I bought them. They are actually a solid very shiny silver. They also appear thicker and a bit rounded in the picture but they are actually pretty flat and thin. Very cute and nice but not at all what I thought I was buying. The did arrive in a timely manner and nicely packaged. I'll give them a 4 out of 5 because of the deceptiveness of the picture.

I knew this was it, bought the combo and they were a hit with her.The earings seem fairly solid, made very well and are of good quality. I give them 4 stars out of 5 because they seem a little pricey for what they are. For the most part very good earings.

2479,"The other reviewer was very right in that the size is HUGE. And I mean HUGE. I'm only 5' and barely 100lbs and when I opened this up, I was so hesitate and undececeive about returning it or not. The thing is huge both length wise and width wise.As I was debating it, for Christmas eve, which also happened to be my birthday, I wore a black knee length dress that had a deep V neck with a black cardigan on top, and decided to give the necklace a try. It worked well. I didnt really go out, just family coming over, but I received plenty of compliments from members of my family who hardly gives 'em....and one who even asked me for it! lol So I guess it's a good buy!It really is unique though and you wont be finding the same pendent on someone else! lolBut again as the other reviewer state, besides a v-neck shirt/dress, I wouldnt know what else to wear it with...I also wish the chain was a bit shorter... as I'm a petite person myself and would rather have the pendent sit further up my neck...Otherwise though, I'm glad I purchased it as it is unique.

2482,"Not super impressive in reality. Very pretty, but much smaller than the pictures make you think. The stones are dulled a bit as well.

2510,"I researched ultrasonic cleaners last year and got this one for my wife. She is VERY happy with it. The other cheaper ones didn't appear to do anything according to the reviews. The professional ones probably work better; however, they are also much more expensive. With this one, you can see the dirt coming off of the jewelry. It comes with cleaning solution and works better with the solution. My wife reuses the solution until it is really dirty, after 1 year she still has 1/2 a bottle left. She uses it for rings, necklaces, and bracelets.
",4
2518,"I got this from my husband as an anniversary gift and it is BEAUTIFUL! It is even more beautiful in person than in the photos shown. The stones look darker when you're wearing the ring but I think the picture is accurate for how dark they are when it's on. We don't have any heirlooms in my family and I feel like I got one with this ring. People always think it's a real antique. I love it!
",4
2523,"It's way smaller than the picture suggests. It's too girly-looking for a senior although if it was larger, I might have worn it. It seems to be more fit for a teenager. It's a very pretty blue and the pendant is nicely crafted but the chain is too flimsy and short.

2530,"Bought those for christmas and i'm in love with them they are my new favorite studs
",4
2539,"This charm is very beautiful! A bit pricey, or else I would of given it five stars. But it's well worth keeping.
",4
2556,"The silver is very good quality, same as the stones.. only the rubies are a bit lighter colour than the picture, and one earring doesn't close perfectly, but that's not a real problem! But the earrings do look nice!

2566,"Got someone who likes turquoise? They'll probably like these chip earrings. I saw from a few other reviews that some people were dissatisfied with the color of the turquoise... I didn't have that problem. I gave these as a gift and the girl liked them; she thought they were probably around $10 so I suppose that's a win for me.I can't comment on how durable they are, but they look pretty good when she wears them. They're a bit small, probably you only get 5 or 6 chips per earring, but they work for a simple accessory. If you want something a bit more elegant (and a bit more expensive) I would recommend these:Sterling Silver Double Oval Drop Earrings.Thanks for reading :)
",4
2580,"Product was described accurately. Turquoise stone earrings on sterling silver hooks. Great for people with sensitivity to metal. Product was a good price for its quality.
",4
2581,"I like the earrings themselves, but they were a suggested buy with a turquoise necklace and bracelet, and the blues are nowhere close to matching. The other 2 pieces are more green and these are more blue.
",4
2590,"I gave it a four star instead of five because the earrings are a bit heavy. The carnelian and the tiger eye chips are just lovely. It's a great product for the price.

2603,"The Red and White Bullsey Logo Barbell Tongue ring isn't something you want to wear everyday because it makes you feel like you have a fat tongue. By the end of the day you're mostly used to it, but it's still a little odd. You can tell by the picture that the bullseye is about twice the size of a normal barbell ball.

2619,"I just received these lovely earrings for Christmas from my son, and I love them. These earrings have been on my Amazon Wish List for almost two years, but my kids always overlooked them in favor of DVDs or books. I was thrilled to finally receive them!Having only seen them on Amazon's website, I was very pleased to finally see these in real life. They are beautiful! The crystals are much lighter than the photo suggests...almost a mint green, but I love the color.I was a bit surprised that Silver Speck charged $5.95 S&H;, since these earrings barely weigh one ounce. Must've been very cheap to mail. That's my only complaint, I guess: the S&H; cost almost as much as the earrings!! In fact, I've removed one star from my rating for that very reason (i.e., S&H; way too high).

2623,"I really like how fast u guys got it to me and it was very cool addiction to my collection.

2624,"I purchase 2 of these for my wedding. One for my husband and one for my step-son. They are very small.. but I knew that when I bought them. I would recommend this.

2631,"I purchased this U.S.Navy Irish Celtic Cross as a Christmas gift for my 19 year old son. He says that it is his favorite Christmas gift and has been very proudly showing it to family and friends. He is in Naval Officer training and is very excited over the fact that the cross symbolizes his Irish heritage and Christian faith. Product is beautifully detailed and I am very pleased with the seller's customer service. Only drawback is that I wish it came with a chain included. Had to buy my own 24"" silver chain.
",4
2632,"The contrast isn't as clear on the ring but i love the yin yang symbol surrounded in blue.
",4
2641,"I loved the flame design. I have a few flames on my bike, so I wanted this one. My complaint is that the screw ball fastener is plastic and the threads are metal. That'll last about one day with me---I'm too active. I've been known to loose the metal balls, but the plastic will probably break first. Maybe they should sell a set of metal balls. But then again, the price is right, so who cares, enjoy it for a while.
",4
2650,"The charm is good but the shipping was high @ $6.00 . This cost may have been reduced by using a smaller package or a padded envelope.

2653,"The tourmaline earrings appeared to be of good quality and style and had screw-on backs for security. My girl friend liked them.
",4
2656,"These are quite large (the circle part is the size of a penny) and heavier than I like my earrings - my fault since I never made the conversion to metric. That said, I still like them and will wear them.

2658,"I bought this necklace for my grandchild. It is of good quality and looked exactly as the picture on-line. I highly recommend this necklace for little girls.
",4
2661,"I wear this necklace to symbolize my son. He was born in March so his birthstone is AquaMarine. I've been wearing the necklace since I received it in the mail from Amazon and plan to wear it for the rest of my life. I am all about family and I'm very sentimental so things like this mean the world to me.

2672,"My boyfriend and I loved the cufflinks. They were really nicely packaged and arrived on time. Also the design was very pretty.
",4
2682,"I bought this ring to go with the Queen of Hearts enamel heart necklace they have. The pictures make it look fairly normal size but it is in fact tiny. The hearts are a beautiful red enamel but they are small. The ring does fit great and looks cute but not what i expected size wise.
",4
2703,"There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points:- End stays screwed on relatively well- WILL crack if you bite on the balls accidentally- Does not irritate or inflame tongue- Not uncomfortable to wear
",4
2705,"The diamonds are beautiful and I couldn't be happier with how the necklace looks. The only thing I don't like is that the chain is so thin I worry that it will easily break. A chain that is not so delicate would be a better choice.
",4
2709,"I gave this 10k white gold Diamond heart tennis bracelet to my wife on her birthday. She was suprprised and very happy to receive such a nice gift. Only problem is that lock of the Bracelet is very loose so its not suitable to wear everyday.(You never know when it will drop from your hand).
",4
2715,"I like this piece, but I don't love it. The photo is very accurate. Both the peridot and amethyst stones are as deep in color as they appear. ""In person"", the peridot stones are a little deeper than I personally like. I like the style of this necklace and was hoping the peridot stones would be lighter than the photo....that amethyst drop stone in this necklace, is a thing of beauty! Peridot comes in many hues, some of the best quality peridot is very deep green, but it really isn't one of my favorites, however; it is my birthstone, so I like to wear it, sometimes. I have purchased three other pieces of peridot from Peora that I love. That said, it's a well made, quality necklace I will definitely wear. It's also, comfortable on the neck and stays in place.
",4
2740,"I was disappointed as to the size of the hoops. The picture was not actual size and the details only told the width not the diamiter of the hoop. I looked but could not find them. They are nice and were a good price, but in the future the diameter of the hoop would be be helpful.
",4
2742,"It was a gift, so I don't know if it came in the correct box or not. What I do know is that it is much nicer than the previous bracelet I had of similar design. (The other one was very cheaply made.) I'm sure I'll enjoy this bracelet for a lifetime. I get a lot of compliments on it.
",4
2748,"I bought these for my dad for my wedding. They're the kind of style that a young or older guy could wear. Classic yet unique. Love the purple color too.
",4
2749,"I thought this ring was very pretty. Doesn't look much like a butterfly but it's still pretty on my hand.
",4
2759,"I ordered this ring set for my upcoming 3rd anniversary. It really is very pretty and modest. Not at all flashy. Has an antique-looking quality.
",4
2767,"Once this ring reached me I was very happy with it. It looks real, has a nice shine, and fits perfectly. BEAUTIFUL.
",4
2770,"I think this is the product set that I just received as a gift. It's obviously not from Eden on Cape Cod but very similiar. It's a very delicate, simple set and looks very nice on. It seems to be of pretty decent quality too.
",4
2773,"This bracelet was purchased for my 7 year old. She really likes it. It has strong cording so that it will not break easily. The one problem that I do find with it is that the horse charms will fall off easily though. I know this is an issue with the charm bracelet itself, however I have found a couple possible solutions. Either soder it your self OR buy the really good metal glue. It works really well.Great bracelet, very cute..two different types of horses. Would actually rate it ..4 1/2 stars.
",4
2825,"I wasn't really sure what to expect of this set of 3 rings. However, it's a very appealing ring. I'm not sure if I could fool anyone that they're real diamonds but it's still very beautiful and I plan to wear it often.
",4
2826,"resonable price.No bad for private wearing.If you need to look better.Should make by used more weight of sterling silver.and bigger Cz.if the price is more expensive but i can affordable.for conclusion this ring good enough for private wearing and reasonable price
",4
2848,"I purchased this set because I wanted to see if a stackable set of right would nice with my engagement ring as I am getting married in March. I have since been wearing the rings and have gotten so many compliments on them! Worth the price and shine just as a real diamond does!
",4
2860,"I have been wearing these rings for about a month now and I am very impressed. The problem with other rings I have purchased like these has always been the fact that the stones have fallen out within the first week of wearing them. I have NOT lost any stones and these rings have been a great substitute for my gold rings. I have been very pleased so far.....
",4
2864,"Still as beautiful as the day I bought them! One of the bands is slightly larger than the other two, which is fine with me. Other than that, I can't believe how little I paid for these beautiful bands!
",4
2871,"Great set of rings. They are as advertised and are decent quality for the money. Very comfortable. My only issue - they were just a pinch large - nothing a ring guard couldn't solve. Will surely purchase from this manufacturer again.
",4
2872,"Lovely piece of jewelry, BUT...What the photo doesn't clearly show is that one of the rings in this 3-ring set has larger stones than the other two. Not a big deal really, but I think there should be some clarification in the product description.
",4
2902,"Looks like the real thing. I like that there are 2 different sizes of bands to make it look like a real wedding band set.
",4
2915,"The ring(s) are very pretty, sparkly and well made but...much too big to be worn together. They do not have the same look when worn seperately.
",4
2928,"The rings are pretty but as a few other people mentioned, not the most comfortable. I like the fact that you can wear one or all three, the only problem while wearing all three is there's gaps between the rings (they don't stack tightly) and seem to come apart. For this reason I prefer to wear one on my thumb, looks cool and keeps the ring from rubbing on the other fingers. I cannot imagine wearing these on a middle finger, ouch. They are well made (hence the 4 stars) and hopefully the little CZ's won't fall out as they have done in other rings I've purchased elsewhere and had to return.
",4
2956,"Only had it for a few days, but like the look of it. Time will tell if it can hold up
",4
2959,"The rings are very beautiful and look real. I've had several compliments on them. Only problem was that one of stones fell out after only a couple of times wearing them. I ordered another set so I would have some replacements.
",4
2962,"The band is bright and seems to be well made-I ordered this for granddaughter and she really likes it. She thinks it will stand up to here daily duties in hospital -wearing it instead of her wedding rings.
",4
2970,"fun ring, it is sparkly and looks like diamonds from a distance. not sure how long it will look fresh but it has been a fun ring to wear and it is pretty
",4
2971,"These rings are very nice. I wouldn't say they look real, but they are very pretty. I originally bought this to wear one at a time as an anniversary band behind my wedding set, but right next to the real thing, you can really tell that this isn't real. So I wear them on my right hand, and they look great. One thing I have noticed is that these rings are very hard to clean because it's impossible to get a brush in behind all the little stones.
",4
2972,"I like the sparkle of this set, which can be worn as a single ring, two, or all three. I typically like slightly larger rings, but this is OK. I think I was hoping the bands were a little wider, but this works with certain outfits.
",4
2985,"Nice pearls, good luminence, well made.Good priceMade a nice gift for my wife, as she wouldn't normally shop for pearls for herself, and it beat going to a jewelry store and dealing with an obnoxious salesperson.
",4
2993,"These earrings have a great color to them. The peridot is bright. The iolite is a nice shade of blue. The silver compliments the earrings. The only drawback is they are smaller than I thought. If you like a conservative length, these are great.
",4
2994,"I must admit I know nothing about cuff links, but these came in quickly and look very nice. They came in a nice silver looking box that makes a nice presentation. They are a gift and we will see if they hold up. Overall, a good experience.
",4
3012,"I purchased these for my 2 granddaughters (ages 4 and 7) who wanted big earrings. I didn't want to invest in gold (for fear of loss) nor did I want to purchase hoops (for fear of injury). They both loved them! the price was just right; if they lose them it doesn't break my budget and they feel like big girls.
",4
3025,"This bracelet, purchased on a whim and a gold box deal, is more sparkly than my diamond tennis bracelet ever was. The real one always seemed like it needed cleaning in order to be truly sparkly and the settings interfered with sunlight hitting it to get the multicolored effect. This one is also MUCH better than my real tennis bracelet because the real one is missing. This one looked enough like it, from a picture anyway, that I thought my mom wouldn't notice.Anyway, interestingly enough, this bracelet, the zirconia one, has a better locking mechanism than the real one - which is directly related to why it is missing. (A few drinks, a little dancing... and poof, it's gone!) This one is secure and actually a little stiff when trying to get it on and off. There is a double stone system that is also nice because it doesn't catch on things as easily and is strong enough to stay together under a little pressure.And yes, mothers always know. She spotted the fake from 20 feet. In the picture, it looks a lot like a real one.
",4
3032,"Love it, very good quality, much better than paying OVER 1000 dollars for the real ""diamond"" version. Super happy with my purchase and very quick shipping, thanks!
",4
3034,"On a whim, I bought this ring for myself because I thought it was different from the usual assortment. Throughly enjoyed it!
",4
3041,"Purchased as a gift not yet given. Quality seems very nice. I don't feel one should have to write a comment of a certain length before being accepted for publication.

3050,"The color is WAY lighter (and brighter)than the picture..but they are cute and well made.
",4
3051,"The ear rings are very pretty, albeit the stones are a few shades lighter than the picture shown in the products catalog. Shipping was prompt and packaging good.

3062,"The bracelet was inexpensive and everything we needed for something fast until my son could take time to pick out a different medical bracelet or necklace. Fast delivery.
",4
3075,"its a good pendant...nice chain but not as shiny as the picture leads you to believe nor is the sapphire as radiant, it's darker and the pendant may seem to be cheaply made. However, for $30 it's worth it as a nice birthday gift for a good friend or family member, but if you're looking for something more high end at a cheaper cost...look elsewhere
",4
3077,"I loved the look of this pendant, but the chain that came with it is really disappointing. I put a Sterling Silver box chain on it and it has added a really nice look. I have had many complements on this already and I have only worn it for a week.
",4
3081,"I bought this product for its unique shape and since it is a small pendant, it will not irritate my kid. I like this very much, and is worth the money if you have little ones.
",4
3090,"I bought this for my wife and she was pleasantly delighted with the purchase. The necklace is actually small compared to the one as seen on the site. Anyways , it was a deal which we were nevertheless happy with. Would recommend as a gift.
",4
3095,"I purchased three of these for my daughters for christmas. The seller shipped the items quickly and they arrived in great shape. The necklaces were better than I had hoped for a very reasonable price. They arrived with the chains which were in great condition. The charms are sterling silver and had no discoloration or scratching. On christmas morning my girls were delighted. Overall a great purchase.
",4
3099,"I purchased this charm for my daughter. Although smaller than the picture makes it look, the description and measurments in the description are accurate. I thought the charm was a very good value for the price.
",4
3106,"I have had silver Scorpio items in the past. I know how easy it is to bend a claw or a leg. When I got these the back post's were slightly bent, and the one big claw on the one earring was slightly bent out more than the other earring. After a few little light tweeks and little bend I got them to look the same and to sit flat on my ear lobes. I really do like them, they are not too huge, just right. (from past experience I know you cant bend the silver too much, or it will snap, just a heads up.)
",4
3110,"My daughter loved these earrings,and so did her older cousins(who are also Scorpio's)!! Great quality, and worth the price!!
",4
3122,"I really like the quality of the of the sterling spider ear studs. They hold up to all kinds of abuse which I was afraid they would not. They look good no matter which piercings I put them in. The only thing is that some people in society think they're ticks instead of spiders but that's those people's own stupidity.
",4
3123,"These are great, solid and quality feel, but the stud on them is short. A 210 lb. 6'1"" tall guy, I found that the legs of the spider dug into my ears over a couple days, one cutting in. They're fine for wearing out for the day, but I can't leave them in 24 hours.
",4
3128,"I purchased this bracelet for my daughter (who loves bracelets) as a gift. I'm not one to buy things without seeing them 1st but, I took a chance. When my daughter received the bracelet, she loved it!!! It's very unique & the adjustable band is great. It's a little thin but that's one of the things she likes about it. She wears it all the time.
",4
3129,"Its been years since I wore cufflinks, but with the [re] introduction of french-cuffs into the market, they became a necessity. Cuff-Daddy had a more than adequate variety of choices to ponder over.The Good: Clean, shiny, stylish. The ""cat eyes"" virtually flawless, and look sharp. Fairly inexpensive.The Bad: A little larger than I'd have thought... which only means I'll use them less than I thought. Felt-like case was a nice touch-though a bit cheap.The Verdict: Good cuff-links that go well with nice shirts, even if a bit larger than expected.
",4
3145,"Much nicer than I thought or saw in the picture. Careful wrapping and quick shipping.
",4
3156,"didn't know how easy it is, know i tell the difference between made, & real diamonds at pawn shops & what people have.

3172,"Nice quality for the price, looks very pretty and feminine with a collared shirt. I would give this as a gift, too.
",4
3173,"I purchased this necklace as a lightning deal after Thanksgiving in the hope that it would be as pretty as it looked. It was a very well received Christmas present for my daughter-in-law. It is very delicate looking while being a solic piece of jewelry. Was happy with my purchase.
",4
3182,"The pendent is wonderful, but I suggest you order a sturdier chain if you plan on wearing the pendent. The chain broke the first day I received it.
",4
3193,"The only thing that I did not like about this item was that they shipped it in a drawstring pouch, which meant that when I opened it the chain was completely tangled. It took my husband 45 minutes to untangle it. I liked the pouch, but it is not good for a necklace.I think that this is a great gift for a teenager or a pre-teen.The pendant was more pretty in person than in the picture.
",4
3197,"Pendant is very beautiful and has a good size. It is not too big, and not too small. Nevertheless, the chain is as tiny that easily make a nude. I recommend to sell it with a solid chain.
",4
3206,"Purchased this lil guy for a special somebody, as such I was sending it as a gift so I wouldent know what it looked like first hand. Clearly the idea of a gift is to put a smile on someones face, but by the pictures and from reading various reviews the only way to know for sure is if you try it and buy it.If its not up to par when it arrives at the giftee's location then just the thought alone of trying to do something nice should suffice. But boy do I hate wasting money on something that dosent deliver on whats promised in descriptions and photos during online shopping.That said my gift arrived on the estimated delivery date and put a huge smile on her face, its not always about how much it cost but if the sellers description lives up to what your trying to accomplish by purchasing something like this for someone or yourself.I believe it certainly did.
",4
3208,"I had been eyeing this pendant for a while before purchasing it. I really count on the reviews to give me an idea of the value, but being the bargain shopper I am I always want it for less. Recently this item was offered for 50% off and I decided to buy it as a gift to myself. I wore it the very next day after receiving it and I can honestly say it is a nice pendant. As with all of Amazon.com Collection pendants the necklaces that come with them are very light weight and may tangle easily, but the price can't be beat. The Dragonfly on this one sparkles nicely and is a good size for most women (Just over one inch in height and just under one inch in width) If you also like to wear earrings, I recommend some sterling ball or cz/diamond studs with this.Platinum Overlay Sterling Silver 8mm Round Cubic Zirconia Martini-Set Stud Earrings

3211,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She is a dragonfly collector. She was very thrilled with this piece. When my wife is happy, I'm happy.
",4
3228,"I bought this piece (and several others) during the 30% off Sajen jewelry sale in December. This is a wonderful piece...the chain that came with it is quite nice.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I thought the stone would be a bit more blue...it's really more cream-colored than blue-colored (there's just a tiny hint of blue and from the pictoral description I was expecting quite a bit more blue than what I rec'd). However, not every piece will be like mine is! I still enjoy wearing it with many blue tops.Otherwise, super!
",4
3242,"it is not as you see it in the picture..it is so small heartshiny and good looking ..i take it as a gift for my wife and she like it so much :)
",4
3243,"I bought this for myself initially. Then, I bought a necklace for my mother as a mother's day gift and it didn't have enough charms on it, so I added this to it. It was a nice addition. This product once recieved is nice, but I didn't like the chain it was on.This is definitely perfect as a charm for something else!
",4
3245,"Considering such a low price, this is nice, but even though inexpensive materials were used, I would have like to see a better attempt to make something that seems to be quality made. The reverse side (which often get turned forward, due to shape of charm) is hollow, and shows very rough construction. It is obvious that the reverse side is intended to remain hidden, but due to low weigh and the shape, it often gets turned around when worn, and it it almost embarrassing, as it makes you wonder how cheap the backside of it looks to everyone else. (This info came from my fiance).
",4
3259,"The necklace was fine, as well as the pendant. It did not come in a very nice box, and there were about 20 ants when I opened the package it came in.
",4
3260,"The Pendant is beautiful - nicer in person than the photo online. It was delivered quickly & well packaged. I am very happy with my purchase.
",4
3264,"I got this for my girlfriend as nice, inexpensive gift. Overall, it's pretty nice.The CHAIN is very thin but seems fairly durable so I don't think it will break easy.The PENDANT is very nice but smallish. It looks great and very elegant on the front half. It is very well done and presents itself that way as well.The ONLY ISSUE is there is no back to the pendant. The inner area of the pendant bows outward from the border and due to the light wait of the pendant, it'd be nice if the back looked a little better.Also, the PACKAGING wasn't the best. It's just about a 4x4 inch white box with a foam insert that is incorrectly cut too small. Then in a large microfiber pouch is the necklace. It could have been presented better.Overall, it's a nice, inexpensive gift that's worth the price. But if you can, you may want to look at a slightly more expensive piece without the minor issues.
",4
3268,"I bought this for my special lady friend and I plan to give it to her when I fly up to see her but upon receiving it, I realized that the chain is really small for any adult. It's more of a child's chain. But being that I don't like returning things, the chain itself is the perfect length to just wrap around a few times and make it into a bracelet.The heart charm itself is very pretty and definitely eye catching.For the price, there's not really any reason to complain.This would be perfect as a random non-special event present to get someone.
",4
3284,"These earrings are small, delicate and very pretty. I really like them but don't purchase if expecting large jewels. Recommend wearing with backings.
",4
3285,"These were purchased for our 17 year old daughter for Christmas. She wanted a complete set of ruby and diamond jewelry so I searched different sites to put together a set. You never really know what you will come up with. These earrings were just great. They were really cute and would go well with any ruby mix. great price, really great looking product.

",4
3297,"These earrings are beautiful. They are smaller than I expected, however. Still, a great buy, love the detailing.
",4
3298,"I like these earrings but I had to give 4 stars for the fact that they kept coming off and they would be easy to loose if you don't have a thingy that slides on the back to keep it from falling out.
",4
3299,"I bought these for my mother on xmas, she loved it. She danced in cirlces, I don't see what was so amazing about them, but OK.
",4
3301,"Good graphic as the earrings look exactly like those in the picture...HOWEVER, you definitely need French wire earring clutches to keep them from falling out.

3303,"These earrings were everything I expected ... they look really nice. It would have been nice if they came with backs, but I was able to get some for them.
",4
3315,"I ordered these based on reviews of similar styles, despite the negative reviews here. The stone is VERY pale, it is true. However, these are well made and very comfortable and secure. I got them to wear around the clock after my starters had been in a while and they are perfect for that -- much more comfortable to sleep on than a stud back.

3321,"Ring arrived quickly and in excellent packaging. The marcasite really makes the ring. If it were only cubic zirconia, I would return it. The CZ part looks kinda cheap and a bit ""glue-y"". But for what it is, it's a great cocktail ring to wear out or everyday with business-wear. Sizing is true.Very Pleased overall.
",4
3332,"I bought one for my friend, after I bought one for myself. Lots of comments, it's very pretty. It does catch a little on fabrics though.
",4
3349,"I purchased this ring because I love marcasite and wanted something that would look nice but not too over the top to wear everyday. The first ring I ordered did have a crystal stone fall out less than a week after receiving it, however I simply returned it to Amazon, taking a chance on a replacement. The replacement came and looked better than the first one. I wear the new one, almost everyday and couldn't be happier. I haven't had any more problems and it still looks nice and pretty. So yes I agree that you get what you pay for and for the price, I think the ring is well worth the ""risk"". Happy Shopping!!
",4
3356,"Purchased for a friend from her wish list. She loves it and wears it all the time. I thought it was a bit cheaper looking than the picture made out, but it's inexpensive.
",4
3358,"I agree with the other posters that the ring could use more contrast, as in the picture and the silver is quite thin. But it's a nice ring for the price (the CZs are very realistic) and looks substantial on the hand. A nice dress up ring, good for a inexpensive Xmas gift.
",4
3365,"I bought this ring for work. I typically wear a size 6 for rings, but bought an 8. I figured since the ring has twists it might not be perfectly smooth and round. I was right. If you buy this ring I would suggest getting a size or two larger to ensure that it fits. For the price the ring is beautiful! It looks great with almost any outfit. It really helps to dress an outfit up. This is a great generic ring that can go with all kinds of outfits. If you are looking for a great day-to-day or even a 'going out' ring I would recommend buying this. However, I would keep in mind the sizing.
",4
3366,"Thia is a very nice piece of jewelry, looks exactly like the picture, however it runs a little small. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who likes to wear a middle finger ring. The crystals are very clear.
",4
3369,"The ring is lovely however it is a little to wide on the knuckle, making it uncomfortable to wear all day. Hopefully with cold weater coming, the ring will fit more easily.
",4
3373,"I bought this ring for my girlfriend. She's been wearing it for about nine months now without any problems. The ring is attractive, and she's received some compliments on it. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase, and my girlfriend seems to like it, as well.
",4
3375,"I bought it as a gift for my cousin sister . it was very beautiful . earings are big enough and noticeable.my sister loved it.i wish packaging was little better . the packaging looked little cheap .
",4
3378,"The Sharingan anime necklace is really nice. Its great for any real Naruto fan to have and collect!!! Its Awesome!
",4
3379,"The necklace was an ok purchase; it came well displayed in a nice tin box and it was a good gift. The only problem is that the pendant itself is a little thinner than I had previously expected but overall it didn't negatively impact the product as a whole. Great gift for friends that are into Naruto.
",4
3380,"The pendant looks nice and shiny. No need to say, the Sharingan design is cool, and it got my friends surprised. But the chain is easy to be broken - the only downside. Highly recommend.
",4
3382,"I do love this necklace, but the clasp has broken and now my Mom has to fix it. Other kids at my school have seen it and are going to order it too.I Love Sasuke!!
",4
3383,"My nine-year-old son LOVED this necklace. He had one last year but lost it and was thrilled when he got another for his birthday. Big hit!
",4
3394,"I ordered this through amazon for my niece but it arrived with a missing draw.But the person in customer service was able to get me a replacement the very next day. very impressed with the service. And the replacement was in fine without any missing marts.
",4
3396,"It's very pretty & the music is, too! Perfect for a little girl for jewelry & other treasures.
",4
3397,"I recently bought this jewelry box for my 4 year old niece and she loved it! The ""secret"" compartments were very sweet and she enjoyed having the different spots for her jewelry. It was a fairly recent purchase so I am not sure how well it will hold up over time, although it seemed to be fairly decent construction. The only downside is the little figurine, as someone else mentioned... not quite sure what it is supposed to be.
",4
3402,"My 4 yr old granddaughter liked this musical jewelry box. She is very interested in fairies and jewelry. She can wind the music box and open the drawers. A nice feature is that the drawers do not come out or fall out. It is a good size for a little girl.
",4
3412,"I brought this along with the ""Mia"" ballerina jewelry box and even though at the time I paid the same price..this was by far the better purchase. It is beautiful, well made and well worth the price which is not much. I regret not ordering three of these and ordering the other box (see my review) Big Difference!
",4
3413,"This box is very pretty, well built, and the music is nice.When she first saw it my daughter fell in love.However, she was dissappointed when she opened it, and I can't blame her.Whats with that figurine? I don't even know what it is...A fairy?...a little village girl?...I have no idea.
",4
3416,"This delicate little music box with beautiful little illustrations will be a treasured possession for your little girl.It's the perfect place to stash special treasures, and if well cared for, is beautiful enough to warrant saving for a future generation! The illustrations are beautiful. If you are about to buy a special trinket for the girlie-girl in your family, this is a charming gift to send.
",4
3427,"My 7-year-old granddaughter loves this cute jewelry box; when you open the lid there is a small horse that spins around to the tune of ""My Old Kentucky Home."" It was advertised as playing ""Home on the Range"" but my granddaughter doesn't really care what tune it plays. It appears to be a sturdy little jewelry box, but I wouldn't give it to a child much younger than 7 because of the potential for breaking that delicate little horse off its spinner.
",4
3429,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGEU9G/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI bought this as a Christmas gift for my 10-year old granddaughter. She seemed happy with it when she opened it. For the price, I was quite impressed with it. I would recommend for anyone as a different kind of gift for a horse lover.
",4
3431,"My daughter is a big horse fan so this was a big hit. She loved it. It seems to be very well made.
",4
3448,"I should have looked at the description more closely. This has very little storage space. Even the top is less than an 1/2 inch deep, if that. But so far, everything else about it is great. It IS made with paper, so don't let it get wet.
",4
3449,"I got two of these jewelry boxes for my twin daughters who just turned five. They both LOVE the music boxes. There are four cute little drawers and then a larger compartment on top to store all their little treasures and ""jewels"". For the money, this is a nice jewelry box. It's made of a very study-feeling card board-ish material - but it doesn't feel like it will get crushed or anything. The horse that spins around is kind of chintzy, but my girls definitely don't notice. I'm quite happy with this product.
",4
3461,"Purchased this for a young lady who loves both horses and jewelry, so this seemed a good choice for a jewelry box. She was delighted.
",4
3532,"the necklace was great and lived up to all my expectations except for its weight. I thought it would be light and rest nicely on the neck but it didn't. Instead it weighed my neck down a lot and after a hour of wearing it I wanted to take it off. Besides the weight this is a great product for any bleach fan
",4
3534,"So I really loved the picture of this product and when I got it it wasn't the same. It was the same as the picture as the chain and the shape and things of that nature but in the picture it has more of a grunge look to it but the actual product is just shiny steel and also the red streaks aren't colored in. I may have just gotten an unlucky draw with this but it doesn't look exactly as pictured which visuals was most of the reason I bought this. Also the chain was a little short for my neck and i had to creatively extend it so it won't look like a choker on me. I thought it was just because I had a fat neck but my friend has the same experience with it being just a little longer on him. Besides that it's really a great product and I like wearing it and the packaging is pretty nice too they give you a little tin with a clear face so you can see it. Very nice display.
",4
3552,"It is a sturdy piece. It is an ID necklace, not a fine piece of jewelryServes it's purpose well..
",4
3559,"I purchased this item for my daughter, age 19. She was recently diagnosed as a diabetic. The only complaint she has with this necklace is there is no opening, you have to put it over your head. Thank goodness she can fit it over her head. She was kind of disappointed with it because of that.
",4
3574,"this is a cute charm- MUCH smaller and thinner than a charm should be. I wish the picture would have been in relation to a necklace or on a charm bracelet so you could see the dimensions of the product. No complaints, just curious.
",4
3625,"I purchased this ring for my mother as part of her Christmas present. We are part Irish and she has always loved that culture. Her dream vacation would be to go but since we could not afford to take her there, I could at least bring some of it to her. The ring was beautiful. No tarnish or blatant signs of cheapness, clear design, good color to the silver. It runs very true to size and was way more delicate in real life than what it looks like in the picture but I love that about it. The only draw back is that the inside is very clearly stamped THAILAND on the band which I'm sure says something about it's quality or it's origins, and I was a little disappointed over that. All in All I am satisfied with it :)
",4
3648,"I loved the design of these earrings. Turquoise being my favourite gemstone, the earrings were not a flawless blue. Ofcourse, maybe it is untreated turquoise. But they were a kind of blue with brown spots. If it were a good blue as shown in the photo, it would have been a great pair....
",4
3650,"I really liked the Murano glass and matching Swarowski Crystal in the bracelet, it is very beautiful. The only issue I had was that the clasp was so large that it left a big open space in the glass and crystal. Also, the bracelet was too long, approximately 8"", so I had to have it resized, which required that I remove one glass bead and the matching crystal at one end and replace the clasp with a lobster claw, which was an additional $27.00 at my local jeweler. I would recommend that the manufacturer change the clasp to one that is more secure and make the clasp smaller, so the bracelet is not as long to fit an average ladies wrist without falling off.
",4
3657,"These pearls are all attached to each other, as you can see, and the earrings are small. Better for younger (under 7) girls. Feminine and dainty.
",4
3662,"The jewels look great and the setting has substantial weight to it. Very nice.
",4
3688,"The order arrived before expected and as always the earrings were nice and easy to put, they're light so you won't notice you're wearing them
",4
3694,"These earrings are sturdy. I mention this because I've had a few pairs of this style from different stores and they all break at the hook part of the earring. But I think these will last longer because they seem to be a bit thicker.I was a bit disappointed when I saw them for the first time because they had black gooey spots on them both. I had to take my fingernail at scrape off the spots. Kinda gross...The shipping was very fast and the packaging was very well done!
",4
3718,"I read enough reviews to anticipate the size of the butterfly and the fineness of the chain, so I was happy for the most part with the product. It is very pretty, delicate, and feminine. I did have complaints about the packaging since this was purchased as a gift. The velvet box was very nice, but, and this was a major problem, it really smelled badly, very chemical. Also, the necklace was packaged backwards so I had to dismantle the packaging and replace it correctly. Thirdly there is no indication in the gift box that the piece is white gold and diamonds. I had to trust to the description on the Amazon invoice that I was in fact getting what I expected. All that said, the recipient of the gift, my mother, thought it beautiful and was very pleased.
",4
3725,"Okay, I bought this as a gift for my sister. It is a lot smaller than I thought by looking at the picture online. It is however still very beautiful. Very shiney. Looks good with just about anything nice you may have on.
",4
3728,"Doesn't shine like it looks like in the online pic, but my fiancee loves it so I can't really complain =)
",4
3736,"Nice earrings. A little smaller than I thought, but they are very pretty once you have them on.
",4
3737,"They are comfy and I am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals I can not. The thing is I have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears I think but other than that they are just fine.
",4
3748,"My first initial review of observing the gold endless earrings is that they were a little thin from what I expected. However, they are large and it has a beautiful shine. Having slanted eyes these gold endless has really emphasized on bringing out my eyes and I LOVE IT!! Delivery was prompt and they consistently kept me updated about the shipment via email. I'm really happy with this purchase. The closure is definitely a plus.
",4
3753,"my 2-yr-old Dora fan loves her new jewelry box for storing all her little barrettes, hair elastics, & play jewelry - the drawers stick a little & rubber feet to prevent sliding on the bottom (which we'll add in our copious free time!) would be helpful, but there are no sharp edges & overall it's a good 1st jewelry box for a young girly-girl!
",4
3764,"I bought these on sale for a future gift. They are much nicer looking than pictured and seem well made.
",4
3766,"Came quickly. The design is great and hopefully the color doesn't rub/wear off quickly. My daughter is not gental on her jewelry.
",4
3776,"Got this earlier on this week. I like it but idk seems a little too gothic-y for me...or maybe that's not even the word. My main problem with it is that from a distance people can't tell what's happening around your navel because it just looks like black lol. However it does go well with my black bathing suits so that's why it's getting a relatively high rating since that is the reason I bought it. I just don't see me wearing it much with anything else that I already have.
",4
3780,"I purchased this ring for myself. The item is quality silver and the citrine is nice and yellow. I have no complaints. The ring is exactly what the picture shows, no surprises.
",4
3782,"The Jewel Jet did a pretty good job cleaning my wife'sjewelry. But, for the diamonds ring, putting it in a shot glass of gin did a better job.
",4
3795,"These are a little smaller than I thought they'd be, but they're pretty and go with lots of clothing styles.
",4
3797,"I would have to say that the earrings are not totally what I expected. I was looking to receive a larger pair. For the price, they are nice for teenagers. The quality was decent.
",4
3804,"I bought this as a gift and now I want one - very elegant - not cheap looking at all - looks great on my cousin.....
",4
3817,"I am very pleased with this pendant. The only flaw would be that the individual rings are not attached together. The chain is looped around them all, which I thought was a little odd. But I do like it very much and it is a good value for a great price!!
",4
3828,"i really like this pendant. looks very retro and attractive. i got lot's of compliments wearing it. comes with double silver chain that is really nice also. the only cons is that is shallow at the back. you see only nice round finish at the front, but since the pendant is big there is no chance that will flip over to the back side when worn.
",4
3829,"I bought this as a gift for a friend & liked it so much I ordered another for myself. It is larger than I thought & of a nice quality. Great gift.
",4
3830,"The necklace was on a special promotion so I got two of this particular necklace for $15! In case the close-up image of the clasp doesn't clearly show, the chain portion is doubled up and as far as I can tell, cannot be made into a single length making the true length much shorter than a standard 16"". I was actually thrilled to discover that because I prefer a shorter chain.The pendant itself seems to be of not the greatest quality but I honestly bought one as an inexpensive gift to someone and one for myself especially for the chain, not the pendant, so the pendant being very plain doesn't bother me.
",4
3845,"Got exactly what I expected! Perfect to wear in uniform. Item is sturdier than the previous pair I used to wear (which dented somehow while in my ear?) These look great.
",4
3855,"great quality, fair price for a dainty ring.the green is slightly less vibrant ""in real life.""the picture makes it look a lot brighter.still very pretty though!
",4
3874,"The 1st time I ordered this ring, I had it for less than 30 days and the stone fell out of it. However, I contacted the vendor and they sent me a brand new one that is still in great shape with no questions asked. I was really impressed with silver insanity!
",4
3881,"The ring shipped quickly and arrived timely. Slightly disappointed that not all 12 numerals were on the ring, but realize space is limited.Am wearing it everyday
",4
3886,"I HAD TO CHANGE MY REVIEW FOR THIS RING. ITS NOT STERLING SILVER, IT FADED AFTER A FEW WEEKS, AND CANNOT BE SHINED. DONT BUY THIS RING. I COULDNT CHANGE MY STAR RATING, OR I WOULD HAVE RATED IT 1 STAR, ONLY BECAUSE THIS RING DIDNT SHATTER INTO LITTLE PEICES.
",4
3894,"The top review did sway me to buy this product. It came very timely. They are pretty nice but don't think they are 5 stars either. They don't look like a normal gold and gave as a valentine's gift. Will see if he wears them. Thanks Cherie Martinez

3908,"This anklet has beauty and fabulous style. Far more elegant then any other design and reasonably priced to boot!
",4
3910,"The help I received was promt and friendly. The opals were as described 6mm X 4mm. I would have prefered to have paid more and received larger stones, but the ""fire"" and clarity were satisfactory. I would not hesitate to order from this vendor again.
",4
3914,"These earrings are made of high-polish silver. They are a nice size and not heavy. They are not oxidized so they can be worn with southwest jewelry or more contemporary silver and turquoise pieces. They are somewhat elegant and can be worn with dressier clothing. They are not, however, as blue as shown in the image. They are not as intensely blue as my other Sleeping Beauty turquoise pieces
",4
3938,"I live these hoops, look great and have a locking clasp so I never have to worry about losing one.
",4
3940,"I was surprised at how well made the earrings are and look very pretty when worn. I am vfery pleased with this product
",4
3949,"I bought these to wear to work. The peridot stones are small, but not too small to see, just small enough that it doesn't look like you're wearing bright green earrings, making them versatile enough to wear with just about everything. I wear them 4-5 days a week and get compliments on them; they're a nice deviation from standard post diamonds or pearls, but small enough to look professional.
",4
3963,"I got these for 30 percent off on one of those one-day Amazon special sale events. I love garnets; I just wanted to see what a pair of garnet-embellished hoops would be like at such a discounted price.I was surprised. The hoops were a lot bigger than I thought they'd be (just shy of 3/4 of an inch.) The garnets themselves aren't the deep, rich red with a touch of brown I associate with garnets. The color is a slightly watered-down version.But because there are so many garnets, each faceted, on the hoops, they are suprisingly sparkly. I have long, dark hair, and it's kind of hard to see any kind of earring through my hair, but not these earrings. It surprised me a few times to pass a mirror and see the glint of garnets under my heavy hair! A very pleasant surprise!The back of the hoop snaps pretty firmly into the slot (do take the time to make sure the post is firmly seated when you put the earring on. I didn't do that once and brushed my hair, and the earring went flying with very little provocation! It'd be a shame to lose such a pretty earring by not taking the extra second or two to make sure the earrings are on firmly.)They're very pretty earrings, a nice gift for the garnet lover, and an especially nice present for someone who likes earrings that SHOW but aren't overly big or flashy.Try to latch onto them when they go on sale again. For the approx. $20 I paid, yes, they were very worth the money.
",4
3974,"Received the ring promptly but it was the wrong size. Have emailed the company 4 times now to please send instructions to return and send me the correct size. No return emails, becoming very frustrated. It is a nice spin ring, exactly as pictured and I expected, but I NEED MY CORRECT SIZE....please :)Okay they did get back to me but not before I sent the ring back requesting a larger size. After reading the other reviews I ordered a size larger than usual and was happy I did. They sent the larger ring out very promptly and I am a happy customer now. I added another star to my review as well:)
",4
3979,"I loved this ring. Good quality for the price. I found the sizing was small, I would recommend purchase one size up.
",4
3983,"this is a cute little ring that is perfect for friendship, small anniversarys, little promises and the newly started young couple! the ring is all sterling silver and it makes a great gift. though i was not completely taken aback so i dont reccommend it for really big occasions. but worth the price you pay for!
",4
3991,"My soon to be wife and I have selected non-exact matching rings to be used as our wedding bands. I selected a Celtic braided ring and she selected several rings then told me to choose, lol. And I picked the right one she says, lol. This ring and the one I selected complement each other very nicely. Neither of us has ever had much less heard of a spinner ring before so we were a bit apprehensive but I pulled the trigger on it any way and boy am I glad I did! The picture does not do this ring justice! It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and substantial for the price. We ordered her exact ring size and the ring is very comfortable on her and is not bulky at all. Only time will tell if the spinner was a good choice or not but in any case we are very happy with the purchase.
",4
4003,"Good quality, nice materials, no logos & decent price. I had to cut in another pair of notches at the top to keep my pendant from moving around in the box too much. I also had to tape the chain down behind to keep it from sliding around to the front. A little pouch behind the display area would have prevent the need to get creative. But even with my crafty work, it still looks great. Made the gift really stand out!
",4
4020,"I had another much more expensive buckle ring that I lost and when I attempted to reorder it, it had been discontinued. After searching for a couple of days, I saw this one and ordered it. I am very happy with it. It is light, but not tinny and has just enough sparkle. It also costs a lot less, so if I lose this one too, It wouldn't be the end of the world.
",4
4025,"These earrings are lovely to look at and easy on the ear. The only problem is that the leverback does not always meet the hook that goes though the ear evenly.
",4
4037,"I bought it and is really beautiful.It is really elegant and beautiful,it blinks and the metal is elegant too and nice.I suggest you to buy it.It seems I bought the last one
",4
4054,"I am an adult, but I bought this for my best friend. It was a huge hit, she really loved it and we had fun breaking it in half. It made us feel like little kids again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the bottom of the charm is really sharp once it's broken. I wouldn't recommend it for very small children but for adults or older kids it's definitely a great buy.
",4
4055,"I think that this is very cute and I love it. My only issue with it was after you break it in two, the edges are a little sharp. Not a big deal, but wish it wasn't like that.
",4
4056,"I was confused when I opened it--weren't there supposed to be two necklaces? But then I realized that the metal was thin, and someone told me that my best friend and I were supposed to break it together. Sadly, I had already come up with the idea to break it myself, and my best friend is in Alabama, and I'm not. I told her I was going to send her the other half, and I am, as soon as I get an envelope. It made her very happy to hear that it came in the mail from Amazon. However, it is much smaller than it looks. I thought it would be the size of a quarter, but it's more like a penny. But otherwise, it's pretty cool and easy to put it on a necklace, or, in my case, a bracelet.
",4
4092,"I like the earrings alot I have worn them a few times. However this morning while putting the earrings on I dropped one on the sink and two stones popped out.
",4
4093,"I bought these earrings at a Gold Box price, and they are very nice. I find them easy to put on and comfortable to wear, and the small size makes them very versatile, good for everyday wear. My only complaint is that the color of the stones is much lighter than in the picture. Still, very pretty earrings!
",4
4109,"This earrings are very well made and are very pretty. I bought them as a gift and was very happy with my selection. They came with a nice velvet case and arrived in a timely manner.
",4
4125,"I bought this necklace as a gift. Of course the picture shows an enlarged version, but the 0.5 carats of diamonds are plenty enough. She loved the necklace, though this item gets 4 stars out of 5 only because we noticed that the diamonds don't have as much sparkle as some others in the sunlight. As of the time of this review, Amazon was not specifying the minimum quality (color, clarity) of the diamonds. It's still a beautiful necklece -- especially for the price -- and the seller (Katarina Jewelry) provided us with excellent service. All in all, this pendant is a great deal!
",4
4131,"I received a gift certificate for my birthday and chose this unique necklace. It is beautiful and graceful. The only problem is that it tends to tilt forward. It is not attached properly to the chain and that is bothersome. People tend to reach over to correct it so they can actually see it.
",4
4132,"I purchased this as a gift for someone who likes dragonfly's and I'm very pleased with it. It's pretty and sparkles nicely. Haven't given it yet but I'm sure she'll like it.The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the way it hangs. Like other reviews have indicated, it has a bulge on the back with an opening from which the chain hangs. Hopefully it hangs just fine when worn.
",4
4134,"The ring is really small; smaller than I had originally thought but does have a nice shine and sparkle to it. I know its a relatively good quality diamond and cut, that is why its worth it, but I guess I did not realize just how small 1/10 ct is. However, the ring was perfect for my needs (and I looked around) and you cannot find another bigger or better one in the same price range. So, I am quite satisfied with my purchase.
",4
4154,"Simple and elegant earrings. My wife loves them. However, the backs are a trifle small to work with.BAH
",4
4158,"The quality of the earrings was nice. I had to return them because the posts were too short for my ear lobes.

4171,"This is a gift that has yet to be given. I am confident that she will love them, though.

4174,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the gold balls. I plan on buying another set (different size)next week. Earrings arrived in less than a week.
",4
4186,"These earrings are very classy, and the perfect size. But be aware that the backs are tiny, and easy to lose. I've learned not to put these on when I'm in a hurry, after spending ten minutes hunting for a dropped back!
",4
4196,"These are really lovely, simple everyday earrings. My ears have recently developed a sensitivity to metals other than gold and I purchased these to have a pair of small, everyday studs. My only complaint is that the backings are very small and not very tight. I lost one pretty quickly but replaced it at my local jeweler.
",4
4222,"These are lovely white gold studs. I needed something simple to wear in second holes and after going through an annoying series of sterling silver options, I bought these. They match all my white metal jewelry.The surface is not a perfect mirror finish - there are imperfections - but then I can't imagine anyone but myself examining them that closely. My one complaint with these studs is the backings. They are A) tiny B) lose and C) flimsy. If you wish to keep the studs for longer than a day, I would replace the backings immediately with plastic, or even a tighter silver backing. I snatched the backings off of one of my sterling silver studs that I had abandoned, and they immediately provided a sturdier and more secure fit for them. The shaft length was perfect for me as well. Any longer and I would feel them while holding a phone to my ear.
",4
4224,"I was going to get the 7 or 8mm size, until I read reviews. I'm so glad I got these. I have tiny ears and they are perfect for everyday wear. The backs are very delicate and my right earring flew off as I was getting a haircut today, but other than that, they are easy, simple and I don't even notice they're there.

4226,"comfortable to wear. look great on. pleasantly surprised. also, a little larger than i expected.

4227,"i lost one of my earrings from having my ears pierced and needed to replace it with 14 kt gold. this was perfect.
",4
4228,"These earrings are very darling - shiny and a nice hue of gold. The quality looks fine and the backs on mine do click, but the backs are pretty small too, so have to be careful handling them. I think these earrings would look best on a petite person or young teen. They might appear a bit small on someone with med to large sized ears.
",4
4229,"Great earrings,bought a set for my girlfriend.She loves them! Style glow and style they have are second to none! People compliment her all the time.
",4
4230,"I have bought those earrings for my girfriend and it was a surprise.I was so astonish to found out they were so tiny and beautiful.
",4
4232,"ring was very pretty. Doesn't change color has much as i would like. Had a real alexandrite as a child and i can remember the color changes. very believeable size.
",4
4233,"I was impressed with the woven texture background. It accents the praying hands nicely. The charm is about the size of a nickel. The sterling silver did not let me down. I plan to get the real one next! I wear it on a chain with a sterling silver cross. They look great together.
",4
4235,"I needed a necklace for my son's Bar-Mitzvah. I had already purchased the outfit. The top was white with black flowers and a silver button. I searched Amazon for black flower silver - and found this perfect necklace. Everyone thinks it cost a lot of money - and are shocked when I tell them how inexpensive it was! It brought the entire outfit together. It is a lot smaller than it appears on the computer - about the size of a nickel, but it is really cute. My only complaint is that the chain is so delicate it is hard to put on myself and I have to ask for help. I highly recommend this necklace!
",4
4236,"This is a cute necklace that has a wonderful texture. The craftsmanship could use a little improvement, there is more silver showing on the edges of the petals than I would care for. You can't really see the sloppiness of the craftsmanship unless you inspect it very closely, which won't happen when you are wearing this otherwise lovely piece.
",4
4238,"A very pretty sparkly ring. I would like it to have been just a tad smaller, but a good value overall.
",4
4246,"These earrings are beautiful and are bigger than I thought they would be. They are nice and heavy and look beautiful. Definitely a great buy!
",4
4252,"I ordered this chain for a small pendant I wanted to wear. The chain is nice but smaller than I expected. It's sturdy and has the lobster claw clasp I was looking for but it's a bit dull and plain. Overall though, I would say it was a good value for the money.
",4
4253,"The chain is very nice, not too thin or too bold, obviously to be worn with a pendant. It has a nice lobster claw clasp. Also, be aware that this is Italian gold, and is therefore a bit more bright yellow rather than the darker tone, like gold made elsewhere. I'm a bit doubtful that it indeed weights 3 grams, but it's possible, since the clasp is rather solid.
",4
4257,"The blue pouch, the box and the caring card were really nice. But by the time it arrived, the thin necklace had mostly slided out of the pouch and tangled up a little with the poly-filling of the box. I ordered the 18-inch necklace, but for the one I received, its actual length was 19.5 inches, including the clasp.
",4
4271,"I purchased this chain for my mother as a birthday present. She is quite the jewelry connoisseur, and she was very pleased. I feel the chain was reasonably priced yet still a quality piece. The thickness of the chain gave it enough ""oomph"" to stand out yet remain understated at the same time. The lobster claw clasp was very secure and seemed well-made. I plan on asking for this same chain for Christmas from my husband!
",4
4273,"The chain arrived in a big but elegant box, It seemed very thin when first looking at it, yet once I took it out the box and held the chain it did have good weight to it and was a good size as far as around the neck. This chain does not feel cheap and looks nice in style. I would recommend this product.
",4
4277,"Nice piece. Perhaps feels just a little light when held, but it is quality workmanship for the price. I recommend it.
",4
4279,"I was looking for a rope bracelet to coordinate with other gold jewelry, and this was the best price I could find. The bracelet looks nice and fits perfectly, but it is very light - as in weightless. It is good for looks if you don't want to spend what it takes to get a quality gold bracelet with more substance and weight.
",4
4286,"I replaced a defective item with this one, and upon delivery inspected it immediately to find no flaws. Rated ""very attractive,"" according to the recipient.Prospective buyers should understand that thick Omega-style necklaces are inflexible by design, and therefore must be treated much more carefully than chain-style necklaces. That includes both care in use and care in storage. Keep the box and use it for protection.
",4
4293,"Nice smooth bracelet that you can wear all the time. Sturdy without being too heavy. I have received lots of compliments.
",4
4297,"The necklace sits very nicely on the neck, doesnt roll over or bend, the gold is also the perfect color, not too shiny. Bought this for my mother and she enjoys it tremendously.
",4
4298,"I purchased this necklace for my girlfriend for her birthday. It shipped on time and was excellently packaged. The necklace itself is quite fine however you should be aware that it scratches fairly easily (being 14k and all). Other than that an excellent necklace and will purchase again.
",4
4303,"I received the 14k 20"" herringbone necklace in the mail today. It was beautifuuly presented in a velvet pouch in a lovely box. This necklace is an excellent value but it is important to realize that it is only 7.3 oz. of gold consequently is thin. Ladies, I would not sleep in this necklace because of it's thinness. It will kink even though it is flexible. Otherwise, with proper care it should be just fine.
",4
4364,"These earrings are smaller than they appear in the photo. The stones are about the size of the nail of an average person's pinky. The hooks fit comfortably in the earring holes and they were not heavy. They are elegantly shaped. I have bought several things from Silver Insanity and have not been disappointed with any of the items.
",4
4380,"The transaction went fine and I received the necklace in good condition, in a timely manner, and my wife was pleased with it. The only thing that surprised me a little was the color was more opaque than I thought. From the picture the stone looks solid black.
",4
4382,"The customer service with this company was fantastic, and I am very happy with my purchase. I have to admit, though, it looked a little more antiqued online in the photo, and I'd have preferred that appearance. That said, I wear this ring every day and have received numerous compliments!
",4
4386,"I fell in love with this ring as soon as I saw it, so I ordered it. I was surprised to see how small it was. I know they make pictures bigger to show detail, but this is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. However it's a really nice ring, and a really great price.
",4
4394,"Gave these to my love for Christmas. They were beautifully packaged and the stones were big and vibrant - not as dark in color as the picture, but still really good and purple. The cut is pretty, and the stones are nice and clear.Most importantly, she loved them and wears them almost every day :)
",4
4398,"My wife asked for this necklace, and the price was reasonable. She was very happy with it, mostly for the sentimental value since it was my first present to her, and she enjoyed it until she lost it.
",4
4414,"I really wanted a blue sapphire necklace. Unfortunately, the sapphires look black, even if you hold them up to the light. It is a pretty necklace, so I decided to keep it. Still looking for blue sapphires that are blue in person, not just in the picture.
",4
4416,"I am very happy with this setting, overall. The metal was a little bit thinner than I would have hoped, and I didn't realize that ""amazon.com"" would be imprinted on the ring... but overall I am very happy and would purchase this setting again (here's hoping I won't have to)
",4
4418,"It's beautiful. It's clean and It looks great. I would of course rather buy http://amzn.to/fsGM7V but considering the cost this is not bad at all :)
",4
4420,"Due to some issues with my wedding band I picked this up as a temporary replacement. I looked around the internet and did my homework and found this ring to be perfect for me. Simple enough to not be obviously CZ. I have to say I adore it! I find it very comfortable to wear, it just feels like a textured band on the hand, nothing jagged at all. The stones are small enough to look real and the metal has a nice color to it, not cheap looking like most silver/cz rings you see at department stores. The only disappointment I had upon receiving it was that the stones weren't as pronounced as the photo. The do seem to be a bit hidden by the metal. Even with that though I'm extremely happy with it and I've had many ooh and ahhs of friends and family. Absolutely worth every penny!
",4
4423,"I really like the look of this ring. It goes well with everything. My only complaint is that it's not the most comfortable ring to wear. Overall though, it's not a bad buy for the money.
",4
4427,"I got two to wear on either side of my 5mm yellow gold wedding band with a 1.3 karat round stone mounted on it. Just wanted a different look than my channel set diamond bands that I have worn on either side for years. At first, I thought the pave bands were too much, and took away from the solitare. I decided to wear them over the weekend with my wedding ring, and now I like them. I have received compliments as well. At first, they felt bulky compared to my other anniversary bands, but now I am used to them and they are comfortable. I am happy with the purchase. A totally different look at a very affordable price. They look much more expensive than they are.
",4
4446,"The necklace looks great and is a nice size. The only problem is how small the chain is. If you decide to buy it. You should also buy a new chain with it. Unless you plan to wear it occasionally, then it shouldn't be a problem

4453,"my sister loved this neckalace. i thought the pendant would be a little smaller, but overall still pretty.
",4
4479,"I have had this navel ring for a few months now and it has held up well. It's a low-profile piece of jewelry that does not show underneath or catch clothing. Just be warned that the stone has a slight pinkish hue.
",4
4486,"My wife loves this necklace - she loves dragonflies. It really is a gorgeous piece of jewelry, and I love the way she looks with it on. Very brilliant and colorful. A tiny negative: The chain is so delicate, I'm afraid it may break with just a slight tug. But so far, so good
",4
4498,"The ring and its color looks very nice but less durable than the other rings and products purchased from Gem Avenue. It broke into several pieces when my hand just routinely brushed against an strong surface. This however does not deter me from buying more items from this vendor. Their pricing is far better than local vendors with similar products and my shattered ring is unfortunate but no where near being some huge loss. My other purchases from Gem Avenue balance things out.

4542,"Pros: The ring looks quite nice. My fiancee is very happy with it. A colleague even thought it was from Tiffany's ;).Cons: There's an engraving inside, with the word ""amazon"". I don't remember it ever being mentioned on their website. So, if you want your own engraving, or simply don't want theirs, buy just the diamond and get it mounted somwhere else.
",4
4552,"I really liked the color, and the price was great. The only thing I thought that the clear swirl would be even all around. Mine is only off to one side. I don't know if it's was made to be like that or if they all look different. For the price you can't really complain though.
",4
4563,"This earrings are well-made, very shiny, and perhaps larger than you would think. However, it you are like me and earrings simply disappear in your hair, these earrings are for you! They will be noticed.
",4
4580,"I agree with the reviewer below. I love reversibles! The colors are a bit darker than in the pictures, but otherwise it's a beautiful piece of jewelry for the price. The only issue that I have with it is that the top part actually bends if you apply a bit of pressure. This is somewhat worrisome, but just treat it gently and you shouldn't have a problem.

4625,"I fell in love this bracelet, and I received it as a birthday present in October. By November, I had already had the feathers re-attached twice. Unfortunately, during a trip the grocery store I managed to break the feathers off for good. I only could find one caught in my jacket, so there was no point in reattaching just one. I tried to contact the seller to ask for another feather (I offered to pay!), but I got no response. So I had the feather made into a necklace charm (which is super cute) and addedA Little Howling Wolf Charm in Sterling Silverfrom the Silver Dragon. The bracelet is still cute without the feathers, and much less dangerous(!), but it definitely lost some of its character.

4715,"The cross was smaller than I'd expected but being as it's for a young fella, it's fine. It'll most likely get lost or broken any how. IMO the cross would be an excellent size for a really young one-baby or toddler, but with a shorter chain. The chain is quite nice that it comes on.

4889,"I love this chain. It's very pretty and looks expensive. I bought two different lengths and am glad I did. My only problem is that I struggle with the dainty fastening hardware. I was bringing the necklace to work and asking for help putting it on until I added a short extender with a larger clasp and now I'm happy. If you have a hubby or child who can help, then it would be a 5-star product! Gem Avenue, the vendor, is great....

4937,"This chain was purchased for daily wear. So far, it's holding up quite well. It's a solid piece of work, and looks like liquid silver. The price can't be beat, and the service was excellent--the chain arrived on time and in excellent condition.

4953,"The necklace is very well put together and perfect length 22"". I was expecting a thicker/heavy chain unfortunately, it was not...yet still very nice. I think I'll go with a 4mm or 5mm heavier (male) necklace next time.
",4
4954,"This chain arrived very quickly after it was ordered, packaged in a plastic bag inside a lovely little black faux-velvet bag. It's heavy, very shiny, and looks well made. I expect it will last a long time. I had bought it for use with a Thor's hammer pendant (bronze)which I'd bought for my boyfriend. It doesn't go well with that but I have no doubt we'll find something great to use it with,or just wear it plain as it is gorgeous!
",4
4966,"I got this on the lightning deal so it was $15 I believe. It's sturdy well made, and heavy for it's size which I like. I don't think it would be worth what is stated as the retail price, but the going price of $25 is fair enough. The sapphires are a bit dark - but that was actually expected especially since they are smaller stones.

4967,"I was expecting some brighter sapphire stones, and its shorter than an inch...Overall, it's still a nice piece of jewelry, i just wish it was a little bigger

4975,"I love turtles and I saw this charm and thought that it would be a really nice addition to my turtle necklace collection. It is a very dainty charm, and the sapphires were quite a bit darker than I expected them to be, but I do think it's very pretty and I am glad I bought it.

Earrings are in good shape as well.
",4
5085,"This is a beautiful ring and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. The problem is when I ordered it, it was a gift for my mom. She wears a size 9 and I ordered a size 9. She couldn't get it on. I was very disappointed -- to say the least. I know that it is a size 8 because it fits my ring finger on my right hand. I bought her a ring from a local jeweler to replace this one. The ring is beautiful but don't rely on the sizes.
",4
5093,"Like others have reported, the ring size was not accurate. I loved the look of this ring to match some earrings my husband bought me. I used a the old string guide to figure my size and contemplated not even ordering since the size i thought i needed was unavailable i was was sure I'd have to enlarge the size, but ordered it anyway and it fit perfectly! It is a large ring so if you have small hands, you might want to reconsider. It is really beautiful and the price amazing. As long as it holds up, what a deal. Probably not a ring to wear every day...only giving it 4 stars because of the inaccurate sizing.
",4
5097,"PRODUCT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY NICE AND SAFE AND IT IS A VERY NICE RING. I LIKE THE 6MM BANDS MUCH BETTER THOUGH BUT IT IS STILL A NICE RING.
",4
5098,"I like to wear tiger's eye jewelry with animal print clothing and this ring does well for that purpose. I combine it with my diamond ring for an unusual look. The color varies from a golden brown to a deep brown. The band is smooth, polished, and rather thick. It does well for dress or casual wear, but it is delicate as stated in the description and should not be worn for activities that involve manual labor, sports, gardening, etc. I have owned it for several weeks and have had no trouble with breakage.
",4
5099,"The ring is beautiful, but very thick and chunky. Not really for a ladies hand at all. I will continue to look for something a little more delicate, and perhaps use this one as a pendant.
",4
5101,"I am very pleased with this ring for what it is,a simple but nice band,by being simple there is no flaw the ring has a good feel and nice weight.I was worried about the shipping due to it being made of stone however it was very well packaged.The delivery was quick as well
",4
5102,"Ring is as described. Stone is unique, and minor differences from photo can be expected.
",4
5111,"...the stones are a very light pale blue, almost clear looking in color in certain lights. I bought this for my daughter to stack with a cz one, a citrine and a peridot. Next to the cz it is hard to tell them apart at certain angles. However, they did a good job of matching up all the stones. The stones are NOT cloudy and are bright and sparkly. I believe a ring like this with clear AND richer blue color would cost A LOT more....so that is why I gave it a 4 star. At the sale price (and if you are not buying it for the specific color) it is a good value.Also, when the citrine ones were on sale I bought one and then ordered 2 more for gifts since the first one was so pretty. All three rings are different in size of stones and color. The larger the stones, the less color and clarity. I expected this because they are not simulated stones. It's a good idea to realize that when buying rings, etc., on-line. I prefer the smaller, more clear and colorful stone/rings, however, I am very happy with them all considering the price.
",4
5117,"I was pleasently surprised at how nice this ring looks. It is very simple yet elegant. The only problem my husband has with it is that the finish is easily scratched but if you are not studying it closely you can't really tell. I think it is a great buy for the money.
",4
5118,"I purchased this ring for my fiance. Overall we both love it, but as was already stated, the finish does scratch easily. From a distance you can't really notice it, but it is visible if you are really looking at the ring.The service was fast and exactly what we expected.
",4
5127,"It is very pretty, no disappointment there. But it is a bit more ""fragile"" than what I expected. In fact, it can be opened and closed it is so thin. I am not sure if that's a good thing...I'm waiting for it to snap.But still, very pretty and it's not plastic...so I should be able to get some wear out of it.
",4
5128,"Beautiful bracelet. I like that the cuff is adjustable as I have a freakishly small wrist for an adult. however, it does seem to be a bit bottom heavy so it end up flipped around most of the time, requiring adjusting on my part. my only other mild complaint is that the first day I wore it, it ended up having a little chunk taken out of it. But it's still decent for the price.

5129,"I brought this to match a hematite necklace and ring I brought elsewhere. It is a perfect match. I just love it. Shipping was fast.

5138,"I've had this necklace for about 2 years, and still recieve compliments each time I wear it. I will say, though, that the heart doesn't always stay on the ""side"" that I fasten it on - I'll think I've put it on with the plain side facing out, and it flips around during the day. It's lovely though!

",4
5179,"I loved the bracelet. It was for my daughter, her first ""real"" piece of jewelry. However, it's a baby bracelet, not childrens which it says in the title. Luckily, I'm a pretty experienced jeweler myself, so I was able to disassemble it and rebuild large enough to fit her (she's only 10 but it was waaaaay too small originally). She loved it, and I was able to make her a pair of matching earrings to go with it. All in all, we were very satisfied, but others might not be if they are expecting it to fit a child above the age of 1. I think it would be wise to change the title to ""baby bracelet"" though. Even the packaging that comes with it, states ""baby bracelet"" not children's.

5185,"These were the only trombone earrings I could find on line and they were perfect. Matched the necklace I found, just right! Good timely service.
",4
5189,"I really like this stud - it's a nice size, pretty and sparkly without being too big or gaudy. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because Body Candy takes at least two days from the date you make your order to ship stuff (even if you order directly from their site - so it's not an Amazon issue) - but otherwise, great piece of jewelry. I also like the fact that you don't have to mess around with removing the screw to get a new look; you can just pop out the jewel and replace it with a new one of a different color/shape. Bioplast/Bioflex is by far THE most comfortable body jewelry you'll ever own.

5242,"I'm not exactly sure how to review an engagement ring setting, but here goes. Its a fairly affordable platinum setting. I bought it as part of the engagement ring for my (now) fiancee. The setting is shiny and heavy just like it should be. Its a little bit on the heavy side, which is a side effect of choosing platinum rather than white gold, but it won't dull as much. My only complaint is that Amazon didn't offer rings in quarter sizes. However, rounding to the nearest half-size didn't make a big difference and the ring looks great on my fiancee's finger.

5275,"For a little over two dollars this wristband package is a good deal. We received two bands, both white with the pink, embroidered ribbon. The absorbent bands are a little snug, but with their soft elasticity they fit Mrs. Spudman's petite wrists perfectly. Both bands come with plenty of loose threads that have to be plucked or cut off, but for the low price this is to be expected.Our two Pink Ribbon wristbands were made in Yiwu,China.

5284,"I do like the ring, it is very pretty. I did not carefully read the size of the CZ on the ring. It is too big for my personal taste. If you like bling...this will be your thing. I like Gem Avenue's service and selection so I ordered a new ring with a smaller CZ. I like simplicity in jewelry. If you like a bigger sparkle then this will be the ring for you. It is very pretty and I do like the design of the ring. It was true to size and came in a lovely little box with a bow.

5353,"I didn't realize that the pendant would be so small. By boyfriend loved it, because he is in the airforce and his name is Chris. St. Christopher has always meant a lot to him and his family. Besides the pendant being small, it is very nice. My only other complaint is that the chain is very small, and it actually broke after about a week. I didn't mind that much because we had a chain laying around so he just put it on that chain, but it still shouldn't have broken after only a week. :(

5386,"The bracelet seen on the web is a little off. I have a small wrist so when I received the bracelet I knew it would be large. The writing on the bracelet is smaller than I would have liked but beautifully done none the less. The construction and sturdiness of the bracelet is excellent and shiny. If it wasn't for the size it would be my favorite.

Too bad for him, he didn't tell the guys wearing rosaries to take theirs off too.I love the tarnished look and it's anti-reflective qualities allow me to wear it on my vest and not make me look like a gangsta with bling-bling.My only complaint is that the leather cord it comes with was tied wrong so that no matter how I would wear it, the cross always flips backwards. I just used a different chain and it works fine.It's cheaply made but looks more like dark, tarnished metal, which I like.

5398,"As a three-time buyer from Dan's Jewelers, I know what to expect. I've always been impressed with every necklace I've bought from them but, much like the guitar necklace, I'm disappointed on the size of the pendant itself. I mean, it doesen't look bad when you wear it and there is obviously a lot of detail here but I think it should be much bigger to show that detail. I'd really love to see a bigger version, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. The biggest pendant I've seen from this seller is the bearded dragon, which is borderline huge but it looks great and I think this would be an awesome follow-up. It's a cool pendant, very tarnished-looking.

5406,"I love owls and have been looking for an owl belly ring for a long time. This one really appealed to me because of the jewel design. When the belly ring arrived I was delighted to see that it was very shiny (I've had it for months now and it still has not tarnished or dulled in anyway).The only thing that keeps me from wearing this everyday is the fact that it sometimes gets caught on my clothing.All in all this is a very pretty and well crafted belly ring.

I guess it was on backorder but they didn't seem to send out an email stating that fact. It would have taken care of alot of emails and phone calls for me if a simple email had gone out saying it was on backorder.

5456,"I was very satisfied with these earrings. They were just the right size and captured the look I was aiming for. Elegant, demure - not pushy or overstated. They work perfectly as a second (accent) item for each ear.

5458,"I bought these pearl earrings as an impluse buy (couldn't resist the rock-bottom price) and I'm pretty happy with them. My set were equally sized and similar in color. I did however, expect them to be more lusterous... But with them being under $20, you really can't complain.
",4
5471,"These earings are just as shown. I got them because I love amethysts and they were super cheap, but found that it looks more appropriate for a young girl than for an adult. But that is just a style thing, the earings look just like in the picture, after over a year the silver looks the same and they wear well.

I put a drop of dishwashing liquid in along with tap water and the jewelry sparkles. I also like the heat feature, which I have used each time. My only complaint is the ""off"" button doesn't seem to work. Rather, I have to unplug the unit after cleaning.Overall, great product.

5494,"I just purchased and received this item. My wedding rings have not looked this good in the 16/17 years I have had them! It's nice to get some sparkle back in them.The only issue I have is that while they recommend the first setting, they don't really recommend or advise on when to use the other settings. I was cleaning several very very dirty rings and set the setting to 280. When it was completed, I noticed a speck in the metal bottom- sure enough, one of my rings had lost a diamond. It's VERY tiny and I am glad that I was able to save it. But, I would never have put it in there for that long if there was an indication on length for items. I do love this item and can't wait to finish cleaning everything else!

5496,"I purchased this as a gift to my wife who loves to have her engagment and wedding rings sparkle. After researching many cleaners, I purchased the Pro Large 60 watts heated ultrasonic cleaner for wife as a Xmas gift. It initially was not going to arrive until after new years (I ordered late). To my surprise, it showed up the day before xmas.....suprise. After trying the cleaner several times, I was convinced it was just not working....I sent an email to Shining Image indicating the I felt my product was defective....they dropped a new cleaner in the mail that day! No questions asked....The new cleaner works great. Cleans rings as good as my jeweler. The only precaution is that it is so strong, it can knock loose stones out of rings.....
",4
5500,"i overall like the cleaner , the bad things are the heater doesnt work, and it take way longer to clean a idem , the timer is way to short of time , it take about 15 minuts to do a good clean job , i can only get 5 minuts out of it, and use a good dish washing liquid soap in it , dont use plane water
",4
5502,"I own a retail store that sells clothing and accessories including rhinestone jewelries. I bought this unit in hoping that it could remove some stubborn tarnish from the rhinestone necklace sets and tiara headpieces. Unfortunately, even though the jewelries come out very clean and shine, the tarnish was still not completely removed, so I still could not restore the jewelry to its original condition. However, even though it didn't work quite effectively on the tarnish, the machine did an excellent job in cleaning all of my family's eyeglasses. Our vision was indeed ten times better with clean eyeglasses! While in the cleaning mood, I also tried to clean everything else in the house that is made out of glass, crystals and porcelain that could fit into the machine, and they worked too. Even though this machine didn't do a good job in getting the tarnish out, I would still keep this unit to use for cleaning stones, crystals and glasses.
",4
5513,"I am quite happy with the results i have gotten from this unit. It seems that many people have had issues with the heat button no turning off, mine does not have this problem. It functions as advertised. So far i have used it to clean jewelry and nitro RC car parts. It makes gems really sparkle, and gets precious metals quite clean. It does a very good job of getting engine parts much more thoroughly clean than any other method, including a solvent tank, since you can't get into the internal area's with a brush. I would definitely recommend this product to any RC hobbyist.
",4
5516,"Gave this cleaner to my wife as a gift (she had indicated that she wanted a jewelry cleaner). It has worked well on various pieces of jewelry, silverware, etc and she is pleased.
",4
5517,"I chose this unit (which is sold under other brand names besides Kendal) because it got generally good reviews, with the heater switch being the most common complaint.It arrived quickly, and was well packed. Some reviewers have commented on the (minimal) instructions, and I concur. They don't even mention a couple of attachments. One is, I think, for cleaning finger rings. The other? I have no idea.The bad news: the heater did not work. An email to the seller was all it took to get satisfaction; another unit was on its way and arrived 3 days later. This one works!I was told I'd receive a prepaid shipping label to send the defective unit back, but it hasn't arrived (yet).Bottom line: Kudos for a quick response to my initial complaint, but the fact that I had to complain at all, cost one star.
",4
5523,"Firstly, this ring is very shiney and more than moderately attractive. This is what I was looking for, and so my needs were met entirely. As a ""wear-it-just-because"" ring, it is handsome and worth the money. However, for someone with a bit more money to use on an engagement ring (my ultimate purpose) it may be a good idea to look around some more before shelling out the cash. The part of the ring under the cubic zirconia is hollow, which takes away from it somewhat and may or may not make it less comfortable to wear. Also, the rougher band, which is slightly textured but not uncomfortbale, only goes partway around. This is not a problem when you're wearing it because you can only see the outside of the band, but it may effect how the wearer feels about it.As it is, I like it very much, and have no complaint with it, but these things might matter more to other purchasers.

",4
5572,"Bought this for my girlfriend for Valentine's day and she was very happy with it. Her taste for real jewelry, not the 'costume' jewelry is for something that is simple and well stated, as this piece is. The diamond had great sparkle, clarity, and color to it. The reason for the 1 star reduction is only due to a missed opportunity to manage expectation on the part of the picture. The way this is blown up makes it seem like it will be quite a bit bigger than it is. The chain is a rather delicate, very thin piece which might end up being replaced, but seems to fit as a good accent. The diamond itself is just shy of 4mm in diameter, so keep this in mind when purchasing, although I would still definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a simple and beautiful diamond.
",4
5573,"The pendant was bigger than I expected (its a good thing). I was scared that it might have broken during shipping, but the pendant is a lot stronger than it looks. The detail is good, better than on the picture. I was not sure about the faerie, but my girlfriend picked it, and she loved it! My favourite is actually the chain that came with it, and the little black pouch. The silvers all went well together.All in all, a nice item for a partner, even if they are over 20.

5581,"Love these as they are very cute, but they are much smaller than I thought they would be resulting in it being so small you can barely tell what it is.

5592,"nice for the price. I like the little extra sparkle this adds to my studs and can wear them with many earrings
",4
5600,"I purchased these earrings a few days ago, and when they say tiny, they are tiny ! But that's actually fine, as I wanted some understated earrings. They are approximately the length of a pinky fingernail, a bit shorter even, to give an idea. They fit well, and I am not allergic to them. The only thing I would have liked is multiple purchases from Sabrina Silver would combine shipping, as she put both pairs I ordered into one tiny silver box. Hence the four stars versus five. So, nice item, but be advised, the shipping is a bit much for such small things, even with multiple orders. Still, I'll be ordering from this co. again as I've WL'd Christmas gifts for my daughter and friend.

5603,"I bought this to replace a 14K gold yellow rope ankle bracelet I've had for years. My old one is 1/8"" wide and heavy. This one is 1/16"" and very dainty. I was hoping it would be thicker as far as millimeters, but for the price, I was pretty sure it would be smaller.It looks very nice on the ankle, sexy because it is thin and dainty. Again, for the price, it was definitely worth it. I don't know that I would have paid much more than $125 for it, but I'm quite happy and will keep it.I also bought a ribbed 14K white gold toe ring from them and I really love it. The two together really look great.

5642,"I was looking for a pretty anklet but didn't want to spend a lot. I saw this one and saw it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed! its so sparkly and pretty. it isn't chunky which i like because i have little ankles. It is very sturdy and you can't beat the price! great buy!
",4
5649,"This anklet is very cute and the way the silver twists it is very shiny. I have a bit of trouble with the clasp, but for the price I'd recommend this product to everyone.

5657,"I really like this anklet. It's very cute and it sparkles just like everyone said. It's thin but it seems to be holding on just fine. I worth wile purchase for the price.

5660,"I've been wanting an anklet for a long time now. I decided on trying this one out first because of all the great reviews. As everyone else has said, this is a great product and is very dainty and pretty. Best thing is, it fits!..especially since I guessed on what size I should order. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 stars is because it was a lot thinner than the picture shows but it is priced accordingly so it's not that big of a deal. I've been wearing it for a week now and it hasn't broken despite it being so dainty so I am very happy with this product. I am super active and usually end up breaking dainty jewelry but it passed the test and I love how it looks! Buy it!

5663,"The ankle bracelets were very pretty but I had to return them since they were just a little to small for my ankle. I am sad that I had to return them because they were so pretty.

5664,"Im gay and bought this anklet for the summer. Its a bit thin than i wanted it to be but im getting used to it. Ive had it one for a week, sleeping and bathing in it, its strong and shiny. Id recommend if you like thin anklets. The handle was a bit hard to put on though.

5678,"I bought this charm for my 15 year old daughter and her two best friends to seperate and wear on chains. I love the charm (s) however was slightly disapointed that the seperating of the 3 left some really sharp spots that we needed to file to avoid injury. I wonder if the gold ones would have been so sharp upon seperation. Anyway, all worked well and the girls were thrilled. They are very dainty and pretty, I think all in all the quality is nice as well. I also would have liked to see the rings that hold the charms on a chain sodered. ALl in all for the money they are quite nice.
",4
5682,"I'm wearing this ring right now and I have to say I like it very much! I have a small piercing and the length is just about right (an 8mm would be great!). I love the colors in it and when you turn it on either end it does resemble a baseball. I don't really like baseballs but when worn all you see are the colors. Its pretty comfy too so I'm planning to purchase another bioplast from this seller soon!
",4
5693,"For the price of the bracelet, I like it a lot! The stones are a beautiful color, and it seems to be constructed well. It looks great on the wrist and I'm loving the turquoise with all of my outfits.

5705,"This charm was a gift that was mailed directly to the recipient, so I can only review my experience with shipping and being charged. The item shipped well within the promised time frame, and was also free. I had absolutely no difficulties with being charged the wrong amount. The person who received the charm said that it is cute, and I can highly recommend ordering from this seller.
",4
5723,"My niece loved this addition to her charm bracelet. Very cute. My only caution is that it is not a solid piece - the bottom side is hollow.
",4
5777,"I received this ring for a Christmas present from my sister, and it looks great. I think it looks better in person than in the photo. I have very small hands, so I wear it on my middle finger. I think that proportionally, that is probably the best finger to put it on. I think it's a little overwhelming as a ring-finger ring. I really love the marcasite, and the ring is very shiny. I was surprised to see the price when I looked it up on Amazon to write the review. I thought it would have been more expensive. I also like that it is real sterling silver, so it doesn't upset my sensitive skin.The one thing I don't like is the design sometimes catches on things like when I stick my hand in my pocket. I am a little worried that I might catch it and bend it since silver is a malleable metal. I just try to be a little more careful when I am wearing it out and about.
",4
5821,"Does its job. Holds smaller earring though but there are enough earring holders to hold the long earring by taking up two rows. Another down part is its a little tilted. Aside from that great organizer for earring collection. you are able to see all of your earrings. GREAT BUY!
",4
5833,"I got it for my jewelry and I love it, it's beautiful. One little thing though, the black paint comes out easily, had it for a few months and it's already coming out a little bit.
",4
5835,"I really like the way this looks. It holds my earrings nicely. My only complaint about it is that there was a patch of rust about 1/2&#34; wide on the back of it. If it wasn't for that, I would've given in 5 stars.
",4
5844,"I could not think of a reason to give it less than four stars, but five was out of the question. Quality control in its production was not a terribly big issue; the black enamel finish is good, but some of the earring-holder strips were bent. It will serve its purpose adequately.
",4
5852,"Has more than a hundred earring holding holes, its simply brilliant! I had been looking for a jewellery stand since a long time and unable to find something in the store which met my needs, I turned to Amazon. I wish I had looked here earlier. The product's quality is good, the paint is not worn off or something. The only reason I did not give it one extra star is because after holding my necklaces on both the sides, there's not enough space left for my bracelets, but that's okay. I was looking exclusively for a earring holder anyway.
",4
5861,"It arrived in a very large box along with my other order, a heavy textbook. There was nothing preventing them from thrashing about in the large box, no bubble wrap, no paper, nothing. Besides that, the stand is larger than I had hoped for, there is more than enough holes to fit my earrings, and then some.
",4
5864,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. It's heavy, wrought iron. It's fairly big, and can hold a lot of earrings. It's base is very sturdy, and it won't tip over, which is what I was somewhat concerned about. The loops at the top can hold necklaces and such. I give it a 4 star because I wish it had more room for necklaces. But, I've seen a similar style-design with lots of stowage for necklaces, but it has a much larger footprint - I think I saw it on Amazon. My wife likes it, though, nuff said.
",4
5872,"The earring holder holds so many earrings! Its great! My only complaint is that when you are putting any earring on it that isn't a stud (like dangle or chandelier earrings)then it falls on top of the earrings below them. Its not really a big deal and its totally something that you can deal with. So, other than that I am extremely satisfied with it!!
",4
5874,"This earring stand is sturdy and holds most of my earrings. However, it's not good for hoops. Some of the holes are not usable because they are so close together; the shape of some of my earrings make it necessary to skip a lot of the holes, so it doesn't hold as many earring as advertised unless you only have small studs. Still, I'm pleased with the purchase. It probably holds more earrings than most women have.
",4
5876,"This earring organizer is exactly what I needed. I don't have a TON of earrings, but my collection is growing and I wanted a convenient and attractive way to display them. The holder seems very sturdy, and does not wobble at all. It also came with the correct amount of rails, unlike some other reviewers have stated. I compared a lot of racks before deciding on this one and I couldn't be happier with my decision.
",4
5878,"I received the item very quickly and in good condition. The only reason for the 4 stars vs 5 is that there was a couple scratches on the black paint.
",4
5884,"Great rack. I kind of wish the rows were further apart for longer earrings but I even use the side hooks for earrings and bracelets. I would recommend this item.
",4
5899,"This earring holder is cute and practical. It seems really sturdy and displays jewelry nicely. The only thing that I would point out is that it doesn't really hold too many earrings. I where longer dangly stuff and I could only fit about 30 pair on there and they overlap each other.
",4
5900,"Earring holder holds around 80 pairs of earrings which is just what my mom needed for all her earrings. The only thing I would change about this holder would be to alter the distance between each row to accommodate different length earrings. But my mom is using it right now and loves it.
",4
5906,"I bought this to hang all of my earrings. It works fine. The holes could be a little further apart as I had to skip a hole between some of my larger earrings. Looks great in my closet and appears to be sturdy so far, even completely full.
",4
5913,"I was looking for a nice-looking earring tree to put on my new bathroom counter and found this. It really looks great and holds many pairs of earrings of any type,
",4
5914,"I, like the other reviewers, was looking for a way to easily organize my earrings. Based on the reviews I purchased this one. It's sturdy & looks fine on my dresser. It holds alot of earrings however only if you have studs or tiny earrings will hold all that is says it will. I have alot of dangly & hooped earrings. I had to pretty much skip every other row & I put all my large hoops on the bottom, to allow for maximum room. I've put 30 pairs of earrings on it & there is still room for a few more pair but not many. I gave it 4 stars still, because for the money.. this is a great purchase as long as you don't expect to put 70 pairs of earrings on it. I also hung some of my necklaces on the top sides which is a nice plus.
",4
5927,"I have several jewelry armoires and two jewelry boxes. I could never keep track of all my earrings. This sits on my dresser sideways so that it does not take up a lot of space. I can see my earring selections at a glance and they are not tangled and separated. Great solution to my earring problem. I can now enjoy more of them without searching through the menagerie - esp. when I am in a hurry.
",4
5954,"These garnet and silver earrings are very pretty. I bought them for my mother because her birthstone is garnet. They look nice on, although I wish the garnets were just a little bigger. But the color is beautiful and the earrings look well made.

5965,"I read another review about the white version of these and was horrified the buyer wasn't happy. I bought the white ones for a friend who is over the moon, and the black ones for myself and my mother. These are freshwater pearls so there is some irregularity with them, both in color and shape. It's part of their beauty. This necklace is a lovely length, and the pearls are a good size. It's got those really pretty petrol colored green and purple tinges, as well as a nice wieght to it. If you've got a few spare $1000 and are after 18mm tahitian pearls, then don't buy these. If you're after a very pretty necklace you'd be proud to be seen in and want people to comment on, then these are for you. I'm going to buy some of the other colors.

5966,"My husband bought me these pearls for Christmas.They arrived about 7 days after being ordered, appropriately packaged: secured in the box, in a protective cardboard box, wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a mailer envelope. They ship with a printed certificate of authenticity, a little baggie to keep it in, and a pack of five flawed pearls that are a little gross looking.The pearls are exactly as described:Moderately blemished (Which for those of you who are illiterate means that you're going to see bumps, lines and ""globs"" on some of them, it's not paint, it's the actual pearl material forming over bits of sand/grime. That's what pearls are, covered bits of grime, sand, and debris.The pearls are described as being ""semi round"" which means you can expect some oblong or egg shaped pearls, but nothing really deformed looking. Personally, I like flawed pearls better than the perfectly rounded fake looking ones. I know they're real, and I appreciate the pearl formation process.The luster is nicer than I expected, the pearls are shiny and beautifully colored. Black pearls aren't really black, they display beautiful hues of peacock green, purples, golds, and blues thrown over a dark - medium gray base. It's a beautiful effect, it reminds you of oil slicks or petroleum on water. It's a beautiful iridescent shimmer, you're going to be surprised with these.The pearls are strung on silk thread and a tiny knot is tied between each pearl as to prevent the pearls from all slipping off the thread if the necklace breaks.The weight is nice, these are weighty dense pearls, not thin coats of pearl substance over larger plastic beads like some companies will sell you. They're real, you can tell if you've ever held real pearls in your hand.The clasp is good, it will prevent the necklace from just slipping off, but it's always a good idea to have them checked once in a while to make sure your knot isn't coming loose.Remember, regular check-ups are key in preventing the loss of your precious stones and pearls.The bottom line here, is yeah, they're blemished pearls but it clearly states that in the description, so most of the negative reviewers need to learn to read.
",4
5970,"The pearls are just as described, fast shipping and nicely packaged. Even came with a nice storage bag.
",4
6006,"I recieved the locket today to inspect it before I give it to my friend. when I looked I couldnt believe how thin the chain was, It feels like if i hold it up it will just snap. Also the little hinge that makes the locket open is extremely loose and fragile. its beautiful and i have no doubt she will love it. But im going to get a new chain for it and find some way to fix the hinge.
",4
6009,"not so sure the hinge is going to last but i like the design and weight, i have not put pictures in it yet and i am not sure how the pictures will stay in there is nothing to keep them in, i would imagine you just have to make sure the pictures fit tightly
",4
6010,"The Chain is pretty brittle, but the locket itself looks fantastic. Shipping was a little slower than I expected. The locket is hard for her to open but she likes it a lot.
",4
6024,"I've been looking for a locket for a while now and purchased this not all too long ago. For the most part, it is a nice one. It has a sturdy feeling to it when closed and a nice weight. The stone is clear and well set, and if it were to fall out, it would fall out in the locket; it's open-backed. The silver is thick and relatively impervious to applied pressure. It isn't flimsy. What I did note however is a problem with the backing to this locket, and I doubt I just got a poor piece. I've noticed Silverspeck has many different variations of the same sort of pendant, and the backing here doesn't quite fit. I'd gather the fronts and backs are made separately and not much time is granted to make sure once the two halves are put together that they fit well. When opening the locket the hinge is liberal and loose; it swivels somewhat generously in all directions, and it isn't something I can fix.The edges of the backing also protrude past the front giving it a sort of ""overbite"" in some places, which is marginally noticeable. If you plan on putting anything in the locket, be aware there may be some large cracks or spaces when it is closed. For example, I wished to put a single, looped circle of horsehair in here, which comes out pretty thick with the twining, and I was worried about it falling out if the tape failed. Old heirloom lockets I've had rarely, if ever, had this problem, but things by default are not made that well or meticulously anymore. So if there's anything thin and special you plan on putting in it, this may be relevant. Even so, it's a solid and quality locket aside from the points I put down. Is it worth the price? I'm still not sure on that. But it is a pretty piece if you don't expect perfection.
",4
6026,"Beautiful locket; cheap chain. The chain broke after wearing it for 4 days. The links in the chain are very weak.
",4
6036,"My husband Just got this for my bday n i love it, it is very beautiful , Just wish it would Have come with chain/necklace.
",4
6037,"Nice size good quaility peace sign. I changed the Chain itself as original was too thin, lightweight.
",4
6041,"Beautiful and GREAT quality. Sparkled in every photo taken.Only downside is the chain was a little cheap so I put it on anothr chain. Earrings were a great addition to wear as well!I love wearing this knowing if by chance I lose it, its not $1000. (but it definately looks like it!)
",4
6047,"I bought this along with several rolo chains, mainly out of curiousity for the style of the links. This is a slightly heavier chain at 1/8"" so not the typical chain for a pendent, though it certainly would be nice with the right one. The links remind me of soda pop tops linked together. That's not to imply it's cheap looking, in fact it's very nice; just a bit different. It's a good style to wear alone, or with several chains of varying lengths together. Overall I liked it. The 4 stars are for personal taste only. I prefer the spiga and rolo chains a bit more.
",4
6049,"I bought this necklace as a gift and was worried it may look like cheap costume jewelry. I was happily surprised when it arrived. You won't mistake it for something from Tiffany's bought it is a nice piece of antique styled jewelry. The locket sealed well and holds the photo of your choice. If you're looking for that little something for mommy or granny give this one a look.
",4
6050,"I ordered the green lifesaver tongue ring. When it arrived, I noticed that it's not as green as I had expected it to be, but is instead a yellow/green, but I'm not particular, so it was not an issue for me. It may be better to take out the ""life saver"" before going to bed, because, personally, my tongue swells a little when I'm sleeping, so it has occasionally caused discomfort upon waking up.
",4
6054,"The ring is pretty cute but it was a bit thicker than I anticipated. Also, the black peeled off from the words but after all of the black was gone I actually liked the ring more.
",4
6075,"The charm was a bit small, but cute for any Irish Wolfhound enthusiast. It has decent quality. The silver chain is not included.
",4
6086,"These earrings are lovely but are a very different from the picture. First of all on the picture they appear to be light brown color but the ones i got are gray almost black. This makes them look really really cheap almost like made by a kid. They sparkle a bit in the light and look sleek, long, so they are not really for casual wear.So i am a bit disappointed but they made a great gift, so 4 stars.
",4
6092,"I wear this necklace everyday and it is my second one. Great job in sending this to me. The only beef I have is that the first one cost half what this one cost.
",4
6095,"&#34;This item is really nice and unique if you are looking for something non-traditional. One tiny issue, it looks bigger in the picture. I's not that small but i really wish it was bigger.&#34;
",4
6096,"I love love love the necklace tags and sayings but you can't get these off unless you cut the necklace. The necklace is nice except for the portion near the clasp that is the rings to make it shorter or longer (which again, is a nice feature) but it always tends to work it's way to the front and looks ugly. I've had it for over a year and wear it a lot. I just need to cut the necklace and put it on a chain that I like and it would be PERFECT. Great quality and I get a lot of compliments. My sister has tried to steal it a few times as well. Guess it's time I buy one for her.
",4
6097,"bought this as a gift and it worked well. She loved the gift. Would recommend this, the tags are smaller then I thought they woyld be but I am happy with it
",4
6099,"i really like this, bought it for my daughter, it is delicate and very unique, not an everyday necklace to wear for a 10 year old but it is a great quality.
",4
6109,"I bought this ring as it looked ideal for an outfit I had and was going to wear to a wedding with a victorian theme. unfortunatly American ring sizes are numbers and UK sizes are letters and I was told by amazon that size 7 was an S and as that is what came up on amazon I trusted it. The ring would not even fit my little finger. fortunatly it fitted my daughter who is a size M or N so it fitted her perfectly and so she had it.otherwise I would have had to send it back. This is a pretty ring and she likes it a lot. The delivery was fast and customer service polite. if you like 'old fashioned' or 'victorian' style jewellery then you will like this.
",4
6115,"I like St. Christopher's medals - The blue overlay and black around the edge makes a nice looking medal. The back has a surfer which is a little funky but cool. Now the one star off - the chain is cheap and gave me a dreadful rash. I like the medal enough to replace the ball chain with a cord, so four stars.
",4
6117,"This feminine necklace attracted me because of the aesthetic, shimmering colors of the organza petals in shades of pink, fuchsia, gold, and green, complemented by the white of nice cultured pearls. I could picture it with many of my outfits. From tanks and jeans to tailored suits and elegant dresses, this promised to be a versatile accessory that I would wear often.When Amazon sent me a notice about this product, I viewed the larger photo at the top of the product page for a closer look at the floral detail; the flowers looked so pretty and dainty, I was sold!When it arrived, this necklace was beautiful--much more attractive than I had determined from the photo--so now I'm even more pleased. In fact, I wore it to lunch with a friend last week and when she raved about it, our waitress complimented it, too, asking where I had purchased it.Although it's sturdy and looks like a five-star product, I'm deducting one star because it's a little hard to clasp. I always have trouble with this smaller lobster-claw clasp, so that didn't surprise me; I knew what I was buying. However, the manufacturer could make the links a little larger to accommodate the clasp.Highly recommended. If you purchase this necklace, I hope you wear it in good health ... after your mate clasps it for you.Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008author of: 1106 Grand Boulevard

6121,"The necklace is very pretty, nicer than the photo. The flowers are pretty colors for many outfits, it is a unique piece of jewelry. The flowers are a bit scratchy, but I think you could get use to the feeling, for me it came and went over time. I think the necklace it well worth the price and would be enjoyed for dress and casual wear.
",4
6123,"The belly ring I bought is overall a good product. The color of the stones are very pretty, but the clear inner portion doesnt allow you to turn it while its in the hole. I like to do that to keep the hole clear. Other than that I love the new belly ring.
",4
6127,"i almost bought this ring because of its gorgeous reviews~it is beautiful, good quality (looks comparable to my $200 ruby ring), true to the size. very solid and sparkle ring while not overly conspicuous.the reason why i'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the shape is not very flattering. my finger actually looks fatter and shorter in it.also there's only one diamond instead of three (two of them are silver studs). but who cares! it's hard to tell at this size anyway plus the price is great (got it for $24).
",4
6153,"I fretted about ordering these after reading some of the reviews. I am delighted with the quality. The color, as reported by many, is not as pink as the picture indicates. However, when you put them next to a pair of yellow or white pearls, they are obviously pink hued. I think it depends on your skin color, but on me the pink pearls do look nicer.For $21, it was a great bargain for an everyday set of earrings.
",4
6166,"The product came on time and looked as it did in the product description and the pictures. I wore them and they looked nice with my tux.As things would happen, a friend of mine saw the same item (not similar) on another website for $20.00 less. But that's the way it goes sometimes.
",4
6172,"I like these earrings. They are a good size, and are light enough not to be a pain to wear. I had a problem with the closer on one. After the earring fell off a couple of times, I examined it and was able to fix it myself with no tools, so I didn't take off much. Just enough to not be perfect. I would definitely buy these again, or recommend them.
",4
6179,"My wife needed some small hoop earrings, and these fit the bill perfectly for her. they made a perfect stocking stuffer at Christmas!
",4
6180,"I gave these to my 10 year old daughter as a gift to wear on special occasions.She really likes them and they look like &#34;the right size&#34; on her. I think for an adult they might be a little small.They are real silver so now worries about the hypoallergenic stuff either. Thats a big plus.
",4
6199,"I recently bought this ring for my fiance. It is a beautiful ring and was much less expensive than what we saw at local jewlry stores. I highly recomend this product.I was however shipped the incorrect size, however I was reimburssed for the cost of having it resized at a local store. Dispite the problem with the ring size, I received great customer service and prompt replies.
",4
6205,"I gave these to my wife to commemorate the birth of our first child. The price was excellent, and she's loved them. The size was a bit on the ""understated"" side, with which I wasn't thrilled but should have expected, but she liked that feature in particular and wears them in all kinds of settings.
",4
6207,"The earrings are very bright and sparkly. Lots of light play throughout the stones. The pair I received are not cloudy at all. I fooled my ignorant husband into thinking they are CZ (He likes that price better). These earrings could easily cost twice as much.As stated in other reviews; the backs are not tight enough. I would have scored these 5 stars except for that fact.
",4
6211,"My husband got these for me for Christmas. The size is just right for me (not too big, not too small), and the color is very clear and without a tinge of yellow or any other color.The only ""problem"" is the presence of huge inclusions. Husband didn't notice them, but I did. Although the inclusions are relatively large, you'll still have to peer in closely to see them. Otherwise, they sparkle very nicely.My husband is so happy about the studs (he's clueless with respect to jewelry, but I don't really mind), and I'm happy with them, too, because of how he feels about them. I will also be able to wear these casually without having to worry about losing them every time. I know that the nearly-flawless versions cost almost a couple of thousand dollars per pair, and I'd rather get a new Macbook Pro than jewelry anyway (something I'm getting as another Christmas present from husband after Macworld in January).All in all, can't complain, and I love the fact that husband even thought of getting jewelry at all. :)
",4
6222,"bought these earings as a gift for my sister-in-law, came just as described and very pretty!!
",4
6226,"This cross makes an appropriate gift because it's neither too large or too small. Also, the moonstones add a touch of elegance that's not overpowering. It's a little different, and a little edgy. Since this pendant doesn't come with a chain, I bought a nice box link sterling chain to go with it. The box link complements the squared-off edges of this cross design really well.
",4
6229,"I purchased this jewelry chest and love it! I don't have a massive jewelry collection but it easily stores what I have with plenty of room for more.
",4
6239,"The earrings were bigger than I expected, but the face on the sun is quite cute. This is the second pair of earrings I have bought from Sabrina Silver and I will buy from them again :)
",4
6240,"These have worked out well, and were reasonably priced. I could wish the face was a little happier, but I would guess that the area is too small. They go well with the sun/moon earrings that I bought them to match.
",4
6246,"The earrings are great! I wish they weren't as long and skinny, maybe the moon could be a little thicker, but besides that they're perfect.
",4
6259,"I ordered this product (which comes from China) and it was at my door in California in 2 days. I got what I ordered. Can't ask for much more for the price.
",4
6262,"necklace is very pretty,true to photo, however clasp is rather small and can be ""finicky"".Overall I am more than satisfied with the necklace and plan to get alot of use out it.
",4
6264,"I don't normally buy jewelry online but couldn't resist when my son sent me a giftcard for online shopping. After many days of looking, I kept coming back to this necklace. It was exactly what I was looking for. I ordered it on the weekend, with Memorial Day being that Monday, and received it that Wednesday. This is extremely excellent service and when I opened the box, the necklace I received was exactly like the picture. I would feel proud to let anyone know where I got this necklace and about your great service. This is much better than shopping in department stores these days. Thank you!
",4
6269,"Purchased these for my girlfriend recently, they came in a nice little box. They hang fluidly right out the box, no stretching or breaking in needed. Just like the description says...overall I would say these make a very nice gift.
",4
6272,"This is a beautiful set of pearls. They have a lovely luster and color. The shape of each pearl is not perfect, but it is a great price for the quality.
",4
6274,"I bought these pearls for my wife to wear on our wedding day. She loved them and they (and her) looked stunning. The pearls are very closely uniformed and half only very mild (only detectable from inches away) blemishes. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the knotting in the silk was so tight it came out of the box quite kinked. No worries, it straightened right out with a little exercise. All in all a great product!
",4
6284,"There are two things that rate the four star rating; the stones are too few and too small for the price, and the chain above the swirled pieces is rather weak. I would have liked some adjustability in the length. All that said, this is a beautiful piece and I look forward to wearing it for many years.
",4
6289,"These are really pretty earrings but are smaller than I imagined. Also the backs fit loosely and I nearly lost one the first time I wore them.
",4
6293,"The box may be big, but the beads are nice, far better than the plastic or tiny glass beads in most kits. I haven't been able to find anything similar. My daughter made bracelets nice enough for her (and me) to wear. She used every bead in the box, and went back to the craft many times. I was looking for a second box for Christmas and I am sorry - but not surprised - that it is sold out.
",4
6296,"I bought these for my wife -- they're a little smaller than I expected, but fair enough given the pricing. Generally nice, and they came in a decent gift box.
",4
6298,"I bought the ring for my hubby. he loves the ring, but the stone is quite light, not as shown on the screen. It would be 5 star if the stone color is as dark as shown in the photo. Anyway, still a gorgeous ring.
",4
6310,"My man and I exchanged commitment rings and picked these out as our matching rings. They are very pretty, but we were surprised that the design doesn't encircle the entire ring (the underside is plain silver). For the price I would have expected the design to be on the entire ring. But they are very pretty and the meaning is what really matters to us, so we are pleased.
",4
6343,"I love this charm, but unfortunately I have found the tail continues to snag on almost everything I wear. I fear the tail will eventually break off due to the amount of times it has snagged on fabric and me having to bend it back into place. Otherwise, the charm is beautiful...just beware of the tail!
",4
6353,"I purchased this pendant, along with matching earings, several years ago. They were a small gift for my wife for her birthday. Not only was she quite happy in getting these lovely little sapphires (one in the pendant), but she along looks great in them.I wouldn't recommend these as the main gift for someone who gets a lot of jewelery, but if it is a rare thing, or it's a little ""thinking of you"" gift, I would definately say it is money well spent.
",4
6356,"I love this belly ring. The legs kinda stab the sides of your bellybutton and it hurts. But I got use to it. I've had this product for a really long time and just reclently the spider isn't holding it's threads. I supergluded it back in place and it works like new.
",4
6369,"The rose ring, I ordered in the wrong size, and was not available in my size. Was offered to select another ring, or a refund. I chose another ring, and am happy with my purchase.
",4
6380,"A very pretty, nicely-crafted ring, but tiny - even smaller than it looks in the photo.
",4
6385,"The ring is beautiful! It arrived well before the expected date. The rose is small, detailed,and dainty. When I first wore it, I received so many compliments.It does get caught on things, but what ring doesn't? The band has become a bit deformed in the month I have had it, but it still fits perfectly. If you are looking for an elegant accessory, I would recommend this one.
",4
6389,"such a cute ring, definitely smaller than expected as far as rose size, finger size perfect. Wish they came in half sizes as I would probably be a 9 1/2 but went with size 10 fits nicely. Even looks nice on larger fingers, as I have such I am very particular about how rings look. Def worth the buy!
",4
6390,"For some reason i thought this ring was going to be bigger than it actually ended up being, but that's my fault for not spending the time work the measurements out. The rose part of it isn't as clear and defined as i would have liked but i still love it. I get compliments on it almost every time I wear it. It's very sturdy but delicate at the same time.
",4
6393,"I bought this ring to wear on my right hand and to match a necklace/earring set I have. The ring is of good quality silver, not the cheap kind that bends and ends up creating a mis-shapened ring. The ring looks just as it does in the photo and looks beautiful when worn. There's not much else one can say except that it's great quality, good price and if it's your style then I would definitely recommend purchasing it.
",4
6394,"The ring is absolutely beautiful! It is very detailed, delicate, and just so very pretty and feminine. The picture makes the ring look sort of antique-y and old, but when in actuality it is very shiny and bright. Definitely not as dark as it looks in the picture, which I was sort of hoping it would be. But that's fine, I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend it to anyone interested.
",4
6395,"I wear my ring every day and have gotten many compliments! This was exactly what I was looking for, at a great price, and I receieved it just a couple days after I ordered. I would definitely order from Silver Insanity again.
",4
6396,"Rose is my flower. I am happy to choose this ""Detailed Rose"" ring for myself which I never took off once I recieved. Its a pleasure to look at and a treasure to own.
",4
6397,"I am a guy, and I got this ring as a one month present for my girlfriend. she likes it lot and wears it all the time on her finger or on a necklace. we are both rowers so wearing rings during rowing is not comfortable. so mostly she wears it on the necklace, and i was disappointed that this ring has the space inside the rose carved out to save material. so on a necklace it looks pretty cheap.also the rose is actually much smaller (about 3/16 of an inch) than it looks in the picture. I was expecting a rose much closer to the size of 1/2 inch.I gave this four stars based on the fact that my girlfriend likes it so much. but if it was just me I'd give it more like 2.5 or 3 stars.still its cheap, can't argue with that. so if your looking for a nice gift, and not looking to spend much at all. Yeah, go ahead and get it.
",4
6403,"i think this ring was a really good purhase. it came in a little blue drawstring bag (which i thought was nice). the picture does lead you to think that it's bigger than it actually is but with my skinny fingers it looks fine. i love it!

6404,"The item was great it matched a ring that my wife had that she wore into. thank you very much
",4
6412,"It is a great ring for my teenager daughter. I bought 2 rings and i like this one less. The flower is tiny and the band is thin. The flower stands out. I rated 4 stars because it is tiny. Maybe will look ok on small hand as i bought size 9.
",4
6415,"It fit perfect and the stones are amazing. The pics here don't do it justice. I own a lot of real, fine jewelry and my friends thought this was an expensive designer purchase! I love it!

6434,"The earrings are lovely and they shipped extremely fast. I am very pleased with them :)

6453,"This cabinet can truly be a life saver. If you have a lot of costume jewelry and you have to dress for work on a daily basis this piece can make your life easier when trying to assessorize in the morning. Very pleased with the quality but a bit difficult to hang.
",4
6455,"Great cabinet construction, solid hinge and door. Inside felt actually comes in black, which is better and more modern. It has enough room that my wife's dresser door and jewelry on top of the dresser fit inside.Mounting is a bit troublesome, and I'm pretty handy. The wall anchors are crappy. Twice I drilled through them. I replaced with my own. Also, the door is so heavy you need to either remove (wish it made that way) or have a strong person hold it while mounting.
",4
6456,"Super product...had my eye on it for years and thought it would be too big with not enough to put into it. So glad I finally brought it . The only difficulty it that there is too much space for rings. Oh well, I guess I will consider that a buying opportunity. Everything is now at eye level which makes it easier to make selections...great for costume jewelry collections. Bracelets are harder to store because of their width.
",4
6459,"It lost a star because it was very slightly damaged when it arrived. Nothing too significant, but if I'd been able to take it to a store, I would have done so.It is heavy and solid. It's has room to display a lot of jewelry, especially necklaces and the 4ft mirror is also perfect.

6462,"The bottom mini shelf in this product is loose. It can be nice because you can take the self out and go through your items but you can also knock it out easily. Otherwise this is a perfect jewelry box..

6475,"Fine item. Shipped on time. Medium sizes. Nothing to discourage anyone from purchasing this item or items from this company.

6504,"The earrings are beautiful and a great buy for the money. They match the nechlace perfectly (which is why I bought them). The only thing about them is one of the posts is slightly bigger than the hole in my ear!
",4
6511,"First off, let me start with my 'slight' disappointments...1) The color is not as vibrant a red shown in the picture; it is more of a blood red or maroon.2) It fits a big tight for it's size.Likes are:1) It is a bold and interesting ring, just the kind I like.2) It looks Gorgeous on my small hand; bold without looking too big.3) My eight year old daughter said, ""You were waiting for the mail just so you could get that ring, Mommy! I love it! You are such a DIVA!""4) Now I have to find matching earings and necklace!Beautiful!P.S. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is because the color is darker than I would like.
",4
6538,"I ordered a size 5 to fit my ring finger, my other rings for the same finger are 4.5, it was a little tighter than I wanted but still fits. I would recommend going up a size. Cute ring, not too bulgy, the red part was neatly done except for one or two spots but not noticeable. I'm happy with the purchase. It came in a a little velour bag with instructions on how to care for it.

6542,"I GOT THIS RING FOR MYSELF AND IT ARRIVED EARLY, SO KUDOS FOR THAT! THE ONLY REASON I DIDNT GIVE IT 5 STARS IS BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE. THE INSIDE IS HOLLOW. BUT IT LOOKS REALLY COOL ON! I AM STILL PLEASED WITH THIS BUY.
",4
6544,"I purchased other jewelry from Eve's Addiction based on the color red. Wife loved them all but for reason not this one. The seller was very quick to respond, didnt make a fuss or make it difficult to return.Dropped it in the mail and a few days later received my refund. Good no nonsense company and i still buy from them.
",4
6545,"I really like my ring. It is beautiful and unusual. I've gotten lots of compliments on it. The one thing I wish is that the red would of been more ruby red...mine is lighter than I had expected.
",4
6554,"I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present this year. I've bought several pieces of jewelry online and it always seems that there is one aspect or another that disappoints you. On this ring it was that the photo makes it look like the flower details are popping off the ring when they really don't. Under the enamel on the inside the ring is ""hollow"". I am disappointed in that as it makes it look more like $20 costume jewelry. Probably not worth the price tag but it is pretty and unique. For someone that likes a little bit more of a bold ring it does stand out in a nice way.
",4
6560,"I received the ring today & it is very beautiful. But I disagree with the other reviews that say it is too big, it actually fits snug on my finger! Otherwise, very, very nice. Only going 4 stars because of that, we'll see how it wears, then I might change up a star! :-)
",4
6564,"Not a substantive ring, but very cute and dainty. A little smaller than I thought it would be, but still worth keeping for the price.
",4
6566,"Looks great on my wife. The chain is solid so we don't have to worry about it falling apart...perfect length. Great looking, simple design.Definite recommned.
",4
6582,"The chain is a flimsy piece of junk, but the stone is absolutely beautiful. The pale sage color matches the photo exactly, and the cut sparkles in dim or bright light. I highly recommend the pendant if you can pair it with a better chain.
",4
6593,"This beautiful bracelet is a wonderful way of instilling pride among the autistic community.The bracelet is silver plated and replete with charms. The biggest charm of all is the Autism Engima Puzzle piece, the au courant symbol of autism. Each interlocking piece in different colors is rather Gestalt-like in that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The enigma of autism is greater than the sum of its parts!The other symbols of the key and the heart makes me think of the 1980 Pete Townshend classic, ""Let My Love Open the Door (to your heart)."" Definitely a symbol of pride!
",4
6598,"I have an autistic son. I do not feel he needs to ""be fixed"", which seems to be the general feeling posted by autistics here, but to me he is a puzzle that I need to figure out. I would not have him any other way. I seek to understand him to greater appreciate his very special mind. No, he does not need fixing, but I need to understand how his puzzle pieces fit together to be able to see his ""big picture"".
",4
6622,"These are lovely earrings, but from the picture I thought they would hang a little long. I love the color of the stones.
",4
6629,"i bought this just days before christmas, and it got here days before and was in perfect condition
",4
6637,"The ring itself (gold part) is not as thick as it is on the picture, but still beautiful. This is the only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars.Overall I am happy with the purchase.
",4
6638,"This is a beautiful rosary. It is very affordable. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it broke due to use. Other than that I think this is a very good item of Marian devotion.
",4
6640,"The earrings came on time and were very well made. I thought they would be a bit larger, but overall I am very happy with this purchase.
",4
6656,"Basically, you get what you pay for. Nothing special but nothing horrible. I like the design better in picture then in person
",4
6665,"I bought this ring for $50 around the holiday, and it's so cute that I would've gladly paid the retail price!The chain is quite thin, but I wear it all the time and am sure it will last. The star is about the size of a nickel, which I am really happy about.Everywhere I go I get compliments on it. Definitely a good investment!
",4
6669,"The diamond star is nice. Good gift for someone who likes small, understated jewelery. However, be prepared to spend more money on a different chain; the one included is barely bigger than a thread & would not hold up long. Overall, not a bad price for the pendant.
",4
6678,"I couldn't wear these earrings. Not because of them, I have allergies. They were adorable and this seller is a real professional.
",4
6686,"I ordered this belly ring plus two more also by Body Candy on a Thursday and was wearing it by Saturday. No complaints, I will definitely order more!
",4
6689,"Lovely ... a quality gift ... esp. for the professional who takes nursing as a life's work of service. Very worthwhile and beautiful.
",4
6693,"These earrings are very lovely, topaz has good color. received a lot of complements at work. good buy for the money.
",4
6694,"These earrings are pretty, and since I got them at something like 60% off MSRP I can't really complain. Based on the pictures, I was expecting the blue to be a little deeper--in the ones I received, it is very pale
",4
6696,"It's always scary to buy presents on-line, especially jewelery, but these were a hit with my wife. The earrings aren't too heavy but certainly look substantial and have a nice color. Nice quality especially for the price.
",4
6698,"i gave this to my mother as a gift and she absolutely loves it. she wears these almost all the time and has gotten many compliments. for this price they're definitely worth it.
",4
6704,"These were a gift for a friend. The earrings appeared to be well made with a nice clasp, so for the price I'm hard put to ask for more.
",4
6705,"These earrings were ordered for my daughter for her Christmas gift and they look beautiful!! The Topaz jumps out and is like a piece of sky encased in silver.
",4
6708,"I was pleasantly surprised by these earrings as they are even nicer looking than I had expected. The topaz are both quite deeply colored and very well matched. The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish they were white gold instead of silver. But overall, lovely earrings at an excellent price.
",4
6711,"This came extremely fast which I was very happy about and looks cute. I play with my tongue ring a lot, though and one of the balls fell off and I lost it after just one day. It looks cute and was the first thing I used after changing my piercing, and everything looks good.
",4
6716,"It looks like a very nice ring good price too it is a pity that we can not see the ring on it's height and how big the diamond is and the setting
",4
6723,"I was very impressed with the turn around time from when I ordered this necklace to the time I actually received it. It came within two days. It came packaged in a beautiufl blue box, however the chain was kinked and knotted beyond belief. It took me an hour and my husband and hour to completely get it un-kinked. It was extremely frustating and I kept thinking one of us was going to break the necklace. Overall the piece is beautiful but I am not sure I would order something with a chain that thin again from them.
",4
6728,"Fabulous value for money. The earrings were exactly as advertised. I gave them as a gift to my mother-in-law and she loved them. They were a perfect match to a jade necklace she had received some months before. The quality seemed pretty good, delivery was fast. I was pleased.
",4
6731,"I was very satisfied with this purchase. I purchased it as a gift for a friend and they loved it. I do have to say the packaging of the gift is a little iffy in that as soon as I opened the box an earing fell out. But it didn't break or scratch when it fell on the ground.
",4
6749,"I figured it would be small but its really small, I suppose that's why its so cute. It reflects light very beautifully and shows many different colors. Its about the size of a dime, which i wished it was bigger but its not for me. However, if I can find a good chain to put it on, I may buy one for myself. All in all, its a very cute little gem that i recommend for anyone who needs a sweet gift. (I got it for my mom by the way and will see how she likes it in a couple hours.)
",4
6771,"the heart sits a little high up on your belly button, so when you lean over it can get stuck it there, im skinny (115) so its not like it gets caught in fat, but its ok. looks exactly like the picture, beautiful colors~
",4
6774,"The earrings feel well made and are pretty. They are not flimsy. However, they were slightly tarnished and I had to polich them before wear.
",4
6776,"I used these for the jewelry in my store and have really liked them. They have a sturdier string that a lot of other tags I've seen, and are nice and small so they don't distract from the jewelry. I also really liked the gold color. My only complaint is that the surface is very plastic-y, so you definitely have to use a fine tip permanent marker to write on them, and blow it dry or don't touch it for a bit before it's ready to go. Otherwise, really nice tags.
",4
6795,"Earrings just as described - a nice accent for everyday and evening.
",4
6809,"I love dangly sparkly earrings and these seemed to fit the bill, but I was hesitant to buy them based solely on a picture. There are definitely bright and attractive, but up close they look a little cheap, like I could have bought the pieces at Michael's and put them together myself. I'm not sure they were worth $20 but I have gotten a compliment or two!
",4
6814,"I love this charm. I put it on a black leather rope and it looks good but, I wish it looked a little more like it didn't come out of a bubble gum machine. It still is very charming and is what I wanted and for the price it is fine. Maybe I will get a more expensive on next time. Also, fast delivery.
",4
6815,"It was a little bigger than I expected, the lock on the bottom was a little over a cm in length and one cm wide. I like it because it isn't heavy like other charm barbels, it can be worn for a long period of time. The little loop that holds the key onto the lock is closed so you don't have to worry about it snagging, opening and letting the key fall off. The plastic gem is just glued in and there is nothing behind it so it might pop out after a while. Similar quality to what you would find at the mall kiosk but a way better price.
",4
6826,"These were a well needed item in my jewelry armoire. They have worked beautifully with most of my necklaces. The only challenges I've had were on necklace clasps that have a skinny oval shape. The round clasps on the extenders ends are too big to fit through the ovals. Needless to say they rest right where the lever piece goes in and out of the clasp.I use 4 of the five as I'm not a wearer of gold. I like the variety of sizes and the various looks I can get with my necklaces.Also, the extenders come individually packaged in their own plastic bags with anti-tarnish paper. The 5 bags are placed in a neat ""burlap-esque"" teal pouch which is then packaged in a teal gift box with cotton padding. I was very impressed with the packaging.A helpful hint: I measured each extender and wrote the size on the outside of the bag so I knew which was which.
",4
6840,"These are decent quality and do the job. The variety of lengths is great. I wish they were a little heavier.
",4
6843,"These are very useful items, which are very versatile. I would however like to suggest that the supplier consider to manufacture a thicker extender as well as this would could be used on the thicker types of necklaces or bracelets
",4
6851,"Purchased as a gift for my neice and was a little disappointed when I opened the package. But my neice loved it and thought it was perfect. And that's all that matters.
",4
6862,"Every chance I get to wear this pendant I take it. Every event I wear it to, I get countless compliments on its beauty. Its beauty by far foreshadows the fact that it's so affordable. By far the absolute best purchase I've ever made.
",4
6864,"Got this for my wife.She doesn't like yellow gold and usually gets white gold or platinum.I figured some silver would ease the expense and it looks good.It is constructed very well.The links are very even and it flexs well.You can see the joint where the ends meet, but that is typical.
",4
6869,"These earrings are very pretty and the quality is good. I was hoping they would be just a bit bigger but am pretty pleased with them.
",4
6873,"I guess these are not super fancy pearls but my girlfriend doesn't seem to mind. She wears them all the time and not just when I'm around haha.
",4
6878,"Bracelet is pretty much as pictured - it seems like a dark gray with little popcorn pieces. It's an interesting, cool-looking bracelet - comfortable to wear. It looks very good with other oxidized pieces or marcasite. It measures just under 7"" in length, including the clasp, which is a great size for me. If I find a bracelet at 7"" or under, I jump at it. The width of the bracelet is good too. Packaging was a cloth drawstring bag. I think I will enjoy this bracelet.
",4
6906,"I have been wearing this earring for 1 months. It 's very nice about the quality and the price is not expensive. I think that's a good earring to buy!
",4
6911,"If you're looking for grade AA or better pearls, buy one of the other necklaces available at Amazon. If you're looking for acceptable Akoyas with cream coloring, medium luster, good roundness and relatively smooth skins at a great price, buy these. Though several pearls have normal surface characteristics and there's no orient to speak of. This is a very good strand; since they're Akoyas, they're worth more than their freshwater counterparts in a price range similar to freshwaters in the 7-7.5 mm range (lowest price on the web).If you have studied information about pearls, you know that Akoyas are much more valuable than freshwaters, due to the difference in production amounts--saltwater pearls (like Akoyas) are produced one at a time within the mollusk vs. twenty to thirty or more per mollusk in freshwater pearls. Also, saltwater pearls (like Akoyas) generally take longer to form within the mollusk.This strand is commercial grade, as is stated in the description (medium luster), yet they're very, VERY nice for the price and definately giftable.
",4
6928,"I bought these for my Matron of Honor. I thought they were going to look childish, but they turned out very pretty!
",4
6930,"I love my earrings! I think they are so unique and cute. They were worth the purchase. If you're thinking of buying something special and different, you will not be disappointed.
",4
6934,"The pendant is very nice, just what I expected. The chain is nice also, but much to long. I put the pendant on a different chain. It arrived on time and I would purchase from this vendor again.
",4
6936,"The Star of David pendant was very nice; it had a little bit of ""heft"" to it and a mirror finish front and back with a nice mark on the back indicating that it was sterling silver. I liked the design and the proportions for a man; not dainty or exaggerated either. The little black pouch to hold the pendant when not worn was also a nice touch.The chain was a different story, however. I thought 24"" was much too long. It is not sterling silver as far as I can tell, and it is true what another reviewer said about the pendant not sliding on it smoothly. The pendant actually catches on the chain and often does not rest in the middle when worn. (I made a shorter cotton cord necklace to be worn with the pendant instead of the chain it came with.)I am very pleased with the pendant, but not pleased with the chain.
",4
6937,"The pendant is beautiful. I thought that the design would be on both sides of pendant but the image only shows the front, the back is just flat with authentication engraving. I don't like the chain so much, it's not very comfortable, but I had in mind just to use the pendant when I bought it anyway. Overall good quality product.
",4
6943,"I purchased this for my teenage son and he really likes it. The Star of David is really nice and the chain is a very good quality. This was a great deal for the price.
",4
6948,"Necklace chain and pendant are nice. Pendant is on the thin side, would have been nicer if it was thicker. If thicker though it probably would have needed a thicker necklace chain too which would have more than likely jacked the price up. The design is only on one side. I will point out that the necklace chain and pendant does not look exactly like the picture you see. Would still recommend buying though.
",4
6965,"I purchased this for my mother-in-laws birthday. It is very cute but the only thing that I was disappointed with is that the picture makes it look like the entire middle has diamonds in it, but there are only a few held in by either white gold or maybe silver.
",4
6968,"Beautiful bracelet, just wished they sent a card validating the stones.Just be careful when receiving it. Amazon in all its wisdom sent it via USPS without signature confirmation and the box was sitting outside my porch.If you have big wrists I do not recommend this. Your wrists should not be larger than 5.5 inches.The stones are beautiful but I haven't the time to get it examined. The bypass bangle design is also beautiful but the bangle quality seemed to be much lower than the stones.Honestly, i thought it was a little pricey.......but it's half a carat....I'm not great with prices regarding jewelry.
",4
6970,"Received this bracelet today and am pleased with the purchase for the price! Only thing is that the turquoise did not have the lustre that my other turquoise jewelry does. BUT, for the price,can't really complain. I'm keeping it!
",4
6981,"PROMPT DELIVERY. CUTE EARRINGS. A BIT SMALL, BUT OVERALL I AM SATISIFED SO FAR.
",4
6987,"I tend to wear this alot. There are some obvious occlusions.. but nothing horrific. Good value for the money. Many compliments.
",4
7007,"I bought both the sapphire and diamond bracelet and earrings. I have never purchased jewelry without actually touching it before. I was thrilled with both items. They are heavy and beautifully put together. The clasp on the bracelet is very dependable and keeps the bracelet in place. It is also easy to put on by yourself. I like the weight of the bracelet. The earrings are comfortable to wear and compliment the bracelet. Both products are very shiny and attractive and look like they should have cost much more. I would certainly recommend these products to anyone looking for a nice gift or something for themselves.
",4
7016,"I was looking for a pair of silver earrings with my birth stone, saphire, and I found these. I love them. They are the right size and they look really nice on. Thanks Amazon.
",4
7018,"The overall look of the charm is great, really sweet. I only wish it was not hallow and flat on the back side of the charm. I do love the hook closure makes it fun and easy to move them around on your charm bracelet or place it onto a necklace. Most charms do not have this type of closure. It makes for a great gift.
",4
7019,"The ring was in great condition. It looks cheap if you can look from the inner side of the ring, but while wearing it nobody will notice. As somebody else said, unless they are looking closely nobody will notice and if they are that close that's weird.edit:It's been awhile since my girl friend has worn it and it still looks good, and she really like it.
",4
7021,"Looks like a majorly expensive ring! My girlfriends noticed it immediately and thought I had splurged on diamonds!
",4
7045,"I got this in the mail last night - it's a great piece. The design is great and it's a good size. Overall, it's very striking. However there is one slight issue - the stone and the pentacle are very loosely attached, so it rattles. Loudly. So, bottom line is that it's a nice piece of jewelry but not quite right if you're looking for something for (inconspicuous) everyday wear.
",4
7049,"I bought this and originally thought it was junk. I have changed my mind about this now. It is a great piece to use in circle work.
",4
7056,"I bought 2 necklaces for each daughter for Christmas. The girls wear them all the time, they are very pretty and love opening up the lockets to look at the pictures we put them.

7067,"Om Hindu and Celtic Knot Sterling Silver Charm PendantI found this to be bigger & better than had anticipated! Have enjoyed wearing it very much! Thank You.
",4
7079,"I love this pendant! It is a very nice size and very gorgeous. I haven't worn it yet though because now I have to purchase a chain.
",4
7093,"I should have known...the pendant online looks heavier. Worth the price considering it includes a piece of onyx.
",4
7107,"I got the pendant and earrings a couple of years ago for Christmas. They are really cute and get a lot of attention.
",4
7110,"The diamonds in the picture are nothing close to the size they look in the picture but the ring is awesome and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone for the price. Hands down, no doubt. The ring looks amazing for the price. Just don't expect the diamonds to look as big as they do in the picture.
",4
7113,"I was pretty impressed. It's a very solid piece, thick, with a tiny bit of weight to it so you know it's there when you're wearing it. The ankh itself is approximately 1-inch, not counting the loop/clasp (which seem fairly sturdy.) The loop/clasp are solid, so you'll need to find a chain that will pass through it.The thing I like the most is the design - it's not your conventional ankh.
",4
7124,"THe product arrived looking identical to the advertisement. The silver was substantial and well detailed, the lapis was of good color and consistent markings. Great for anyone who has a ferret, or a fondness for minks, weasels and similar creatures.
",4
7372,"The earrings appear smaller than they really are! A better description of the products actual size is needed.
",4
7409,"My husband picked out this ring when we got married. I bought it for him, and it just looks amazing on him. It does have a few scratches (it's 7 months old) but I wouldn't go back and change it because it is so beautiful.
",4
7434,"I wasn't sure how this would be, but I was presently surprised. Stones are a nice green color. Very nice for the price!
",4
7447,"The necklace is great and she loves it. The only gripe I have is that the stone is extremely dark colored and I would have liked a more vibrant sapphire blue at least more blue such as the online picture depicts; other than that the necklace is great.
",4
7482,"I like this ring, but it is probably not for everybody. The stones are almost ""scattered"" for a free-style look. It is bold and different, I am pleased with it, and will wear it often. The silver is substantial, not flimsy.
",4
7485,"The earrings arrived and were smaller than I thought they would be but they look great. When the light hits them they sparkle a lot and catch a lot of looks from others.
",4
7488,"These are actually really nice earrings. I bought them for a great price on amazon and am amazed. The topaz color is really pretty and they are a great price. I am really happy with them.
",4
7501,"My husband purchased this necklace from my wish-list and I am very pleased with it.One reviewer complained that it was too small -- I love that it is smaller. Some of the other larger peace sign pendants I have seen look too big, clunkly and ""bling"" like. This small delicate one looks elegant, but still has a lot of sparkle. I think it is the perfect size!In the picture you can really see the outline ridge of the peace sign and the individual CZs, but in reality it all kind of blends in as a single sparkly silver/diamond color. The individual gems don't really stand out. I'm guessing that they upped the contrast in the picture to show detail. Because of that I had to look really close to make sure they sent the right one, but it was. I still think it is beautiful, but just wanted to warn you that it doesn't have the contrast as shown in the picture.I also like that the ring for the chain is hidden on the back. It doesn't show in the picture, but it is a good sized ring, so almost any sized chain would fit through, including a rope chain or silk cord.The chain that came with this pendant was pretty cheap looking and I was afraid that it would easily break if pulled on too hard, especially by my son. I was able to switch it to one of my other chains, which made me feel better. I would recommend purchasing a chain to replace the one that comes with it or using one you already have. This is the only reason this review didn't get five stars.The necklace arrived in a little velvet bag, which I thought was a nice touch.Overall I am very pleased and have already gotten several complements on it!Peace!
",4
7514,"The picture doesn't do it justice. In the picture it looks dark and tarnished in the ""shadowed"" areas. When you get the piece it is actually very bright and clean and shiny and really just beautiful. Lovely detail! If you are interested in a piece to wear constantly this may not be the one for you, it is fairly durable but will bend under more rigerous wear and tear. The chain isn't very strong but you can always buy a different chain to go with it. In my opinion it's worth the price you pay for it and as I don't plan on wearing it all the time I am very satisfied with this purchase.
",4
7518,"This bracelet caught my attention bec I have some 2-tone pieces (ring, earrings) without a bracelet. Since the design includes both circles and hearts, it's a lot easier to match with my stud earrings. And because it's 2-tone, it can go with either silver, white gold or yellow gold pieces. I have more options!The little bell makes quite a sound. And the bracelet is intricately made in general. It looks classy, and such a steal for the price (about $10 on sale).The only thing is, the silver part of the design sometimes gets caught with certain materials (woven cloth, other bracelets). I have NOT broken it though when I try to loosen it off. Just be gentle and patient.Bonus: all my orders from the seller arrived earlier than expected (so far). So, free standard shipping doesn't necessarily mean 2 weeks! In my case, it was just 3 days! =)
",4
7531,"The size of the pendant was smaller than I expected. The gemstones were of good quality and the workmanship was good. It was a good value for the money.
",4
7547,"Much bigger than I expected them to be - they look more costume-y than elegant, but they're still cute.
",4
7548,"I thought the earnings were reasonably priced and the quality was nice for said price. It was a gift and it could have been packaged better than a little zip bag.
",4
7557,"I think these are nice, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. As others have noted, they are small and the color and clarity are not quite comparable to ""fine jewelry"", but guess what? They cost a lot less than fine jewelry. It's diamonds and gold, and even amazon can't sell precious stones for pennies on the dollar if they're perfect. I looked at a set of the SAME SIZE earrings by a big name jewelry co. and they were ON SALE for almost 3 times the price of these. If you want something perfect, these aren't for you. If you want something nice and affordable that you don't have to worry about (my wife would freak if she lost a $200 earring), they're great.
",4
7560,"I am really enjoying my earings. They are just the right size. A little small but, that is what I wanted. My husband doesn't like jewelary but, he really likes these errings. They were also a great buy. I got them on sale for about $40 or so. I would def purchase them again.
",4
7562,"I bought it for my niece and she loved it...It's small but beautiful!I think its the perfect gift for any woman!!!
",4
7578,"I bought these for my girlfriend for valentines day, the price was right and she loved them. Only thing is they are very tiny and can have a small tendency to fall out of her ears. All in all a good gift for someone special, and havent had a problem with them at all.
",4
7586,"These earrings are exactly what I was looking for - for second piercings. Perfect size, good setting and enough sparkle.
",4
7599,"These were given to me as a gift. I think they look amazing. I would buy these myself if I didn't already own a pair. Happy to recommend.
",4
7629,"The earrings shown in the picture are very clear, but I knew at the price and the specs listed they wouldn't be that nice. The earrings I received were very cloudy, true to the listed clarity and color. Don't let the picture mislead you, with diamonds you always get what you pay for! I only knock it a star because of the picture, since the item really is as described, not shown.
",4
7655,"Bought for my sister for her anniversary. These diamonds really sparkle and made her very happy. Definitely worth the upgrade over the lower quality diamonds. Also, they appraised for much higher than purchased for.
",4
7670,"These do sparkle a little and the color was pretty acurate in the description. Not clear but not yellow either. They are pretty small so be sure the person who wears them is not the gaudy, flashy type.
",4
7671,"At first sight they are really small, but that makes them elegant in a delicate way for girls and younger womens, it s a great choice for a newborn or for a graduation or even for a fiance, nice earings for the price paid.

7672,"They are very small , & shiny . I don't wear them , My wife does . She could write a better review .

7703,"I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend. I was going to Germany to visit her, because she is studying Engineering in Berlin. The trip itself was a Christmas present, but I went ahead and got these, too, because I wanted to make it a little special. It was an important trip for me too.I specifically waited until we went to the Reichstag (I really wanted to go there) and gave them to her.At first I thought they might have been a little small. However, they were very clear and the white gold pushed them quite well. Either way I am satisfied with my purchase. My only complaint would be the that they were not shipped in a nice little box or something to present them in. They just came in a pouch.

7708,"I purchased this diamond earring for my baby, color and size are okay for the price I paid.
",4
7714,"These earrings were a good value, also because I got a discount.The diamond is sparkly, and I like the small size. I purchased the yellow gold. I don't like the large backings, they were uncomfortable, and I had to use smaller backings from another pair of earrings. Otherwise I recommend these, but wait until there's a 25% or more discount!
",4
7720,"earrings were much smaller than I expected, however i did give them as a gift and my niece absolutely loved them. thanks
",4
7722,"There's no easier way to make one's wife cry at Christmas than by giving her diamonds. I purchased this item pretty close to Christmas, and was pleased with the speed at which it shipped. My only complaint is, although I knew the picture on the website was enlarged, the seller could do a better job of representing the actual size of the stones, as they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be. Still, I'm happy with my purchase, as was my wife. Thanks!
",4
7733,"They were exactly what I ordered, what I expected, and shipped on time. The wife was happy to get more diamonds, I was happy to have not spent a mortgage payment on them.
",4
7738,"The earrings are small but what do you expect for a 1/10 ct. They are a good price though. Felt that it was a good buy.
",4
7745,"I ordered this jewelry piece with the gift box and card. The box, while attractive at first glance, is flimsy, got slightly crushed in transit, and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted-on. The card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully, and the message inside is not centered, making it impossible to trim down. Said message inside appears to have been written in plain old Times New Roman script. I could do far better on my own printer, and for the cost, I could get a much more attractive card at a store. I will say, however, that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos. I might order from Silver Insanity again, but I'm not paying for any of the ""frills""- they just aren't putting enough work into it to make it worth it.
",4
7764,"It's not as big as I figured it was. Also, not as clear as it looks in the picture. However, it is really shinny, and quite thin!
",4
7780,"Purchased as a gift. Chain is quite stiff, most likely the nature of the style, with which I was unfamiliar. Looks nice. Very short. Fits almost like a choker on a small framed indidividual.
",4
7782,"I purchased this chain with a Phoenix pendant and it was the perfect size. It went great with the Pendant and it doesn't look cheap, not a big fan of OMEGA chains but I have to say this is a really nice one.
",4
7784,"I ordered two 18"" sterling silver 1mm round omega chain necklaces. They arrived on schedule and were exactly as pictured. They're perfect for pendants or beads with small holes/bales.

7791,"the quality of this item is very good. It is not as heavy as I originally thought, but the necklace is very pretty
",4
7793,"the chain was delivered quickly and was wrapped and padded well so it arrived in good condition. It is very shiny and bright, just the touch of glitter to spark a light-weight summer outfit or combine with dark winter turtlenecks.

7812,"Ordered this for Feng Shui (Citrine and amethyst), it's fun to wear for wealth and properity!

7817,"nice link - not heavy looking but noticableno thrilled with the spring clasp as it is difficult to get on and offFAST shipping!
",4
7827,"I had to put this on another chain because the one it came with is too long for me, but otherwise, I really like it. It's a good size - nice and simple in design.
",4
7829,"Great product for the price. However, I wish the manufacturer would have a heavier, albeit more expensive, option.
",4
7832,"The picture does not do the pendant due justice. Its more beautiful in person. The dragon looks much close up. I would highly recommend these items to others. They have a wonderful selection. I plan to business with them again.
",4
7833,"Shipping was fast. I was surprised at how heavy the necklace is...it seems like it's really good quality. I have to agree with other comment though, the box it came in is cheap plastic...kinda cheesy. I took it out and placed it in a better looking jewelry box. After that, it made a great gift!
",4
7834,"I was getting worried if it would arrive before my girlfriend went home for the holidays. Then as promised it arrived today, last day in the estimated delivery window. Hey its christmas I understand shipping sucks this time of year but I still would have been angry if it was late.Ok item itself looks great, I love the chain that came with it. The box looks a little to cheesy on the outside to be romantic, but the wrapping was high class enough to make up for the box.Im sure my girlfriend will love this, it will go great with her tattoo.
",4
7836,"I gave it four stars because holding it in my hand it just felt more rough and more masculine than I had supposed it to be from the picture. Therefore, someone else might well give it 5 stars. I can't exactly figure out what the shape is. Looks something like a bird and also looks something like a person in a cloak. I wanted to know more about the meaning. I will say that for what it is, many people will love it. It does have a bit of power in the feel of it, but for me it is a bit heavy around the neck.
",4
7839,"Let me start this by saying that I adore this anklet. I wear it almost all the time, with the matching bracelet. However. It is not the 4mm promised. The both of them are roughly 3.5 mm wide. This may seem like a minor inconvenience, and it is, but I feel it is a little dishonest on the manufacturer's behalf. When purchasing precious metals, especially in jewelry form, measurements should be precise and exact. Having said that, I would still purchase it if I had the possibility of doing it over. It is just that lovely.
",4
7840,"Exactly what I was looking for. A solid piece that looks good and is holding up well.
",4
7844,"Let me start with the pendant, which is the part I love. It is really well made. The detail work is beautiful. The weight feels good. I love the gold maiden over silver knotwork. Well done! The chain really cheapens it. First thing I did was set the chain aside and put the nice pendant on a chain worthy of it. HUGE difference. This product arrived quickly, was packaged exceptionally well, and in perfect condition.
",4
7847,"I think this bracelet is very nice. I was not expecting the opals to give off such an orange glow. I will keep it and wear it with something more orange. I would reccomend it to anyone who loves orange.
",4
7864,"I was a bit disappointed by the size of it. But it serves it's purpose by being small
",4
7874,"I bought this as a gift for my sisterand she likes it very much. I thought it almostlookd=s ""cheap"" but she is satisfied.
",4
7875,"its beautiful! its a good length, kind of short but that allows me to wear two chains at the same time:)I can wear it in the shower and all thatthe clasp broke the first day I got it, but I fixed it and have had no other problems since, I love it :) &lt;3
",4
7878,"It's been a few years since I bought this, and the only thing that needs to be replaced is the chain because I used to wear it more often. Otherwise, the pendant is still pretty. No missing stones or any of that thank goodness!

7899,"Nice weight and size! Beautiful and very traditional. If you are an earth person, this is for you! It is great for Beltane!

7903,"Beautiful, my only problem with it is that they didnt paint the leaves well, what i mean is half is painted and half isn't
",4
7906,"I brought this for a good friend for the Xmas 2006 season. He just loved it and claimed that it is quite beautiful
",4
7910,"These earrings are exactly as pictured; they are lightweight and easy to wear. One thing that may not be clear from the picture is that the earwire is attached directly to the heart; there is no dangle or movement to these earrings.
",4
7921,"Really happy with this necklace. Makes a great gift! I have ordered it several times to give as sweet 16 presents.
",4
7940,"I didn't expect much for the price but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the pacakge. Fits nicely, latch secure and easy to operate and it looks good.
",4
7950,"These are really beautiful, the metalwork is very detailed and the stones are nice. I only gave it 4 stars because one of them is slightly crooked, it faces slightly outward while the other faces forward. It's not a big difference, though.
",4
7952,"Great Xmas present bought 5 pair this was the oly pair I had to buy a gift box for. It was in a plastic baggie in a box.
",4
7958,"I purchased these because I inherited a garnet silver bracelet from my great grandmother and the metal detailing on these earrings is similar. I was excited about receiving these and even more thrilled when they arrived days before expected. They are stunning. However; if you hold these in direct sunlight, the stones look brown. Also, if you view them from the side, each earring is bent in what looks like an accident. I bought a ring from this company too and with the earrings and ring, i can wear my family bracelet (which is antique) and people think they were bought together.Sterling Silver Marcasite Marquise Garnet Ring (Size 5,6,7,8,9)
",4
7973,"These earrings are very cute, but are smaller than I expected. I still wear them occassionally.
",4
7975,"These are small and very well made. They have a nice shine and they were exactly what I was hoping for.
",4
7976,"OK, I guess my first mistake was not checking my metrics. I'll admit to that. So the earrings are a bit smaller than I thought they would be. And not as shiny as I would have liked. However, they are sturdy, to be sure, and comfortable to wear. I like them. Could easily be worn casual or with business dress. I just wish they were a tad bigger.
",4
7981,"It is made well, is as beautiful as in photos, just a bit smaller than I expected. When wearing it, I'm not sure it lays properly on me, but overall gave it a 4, because of proper packing, and great workmanship. It definitely looks antique, and have had a few compliments.UPDATE: 07/28/11- I have owned this since Xmas of 2010, now about 7 months... I have worn it about 5 or 6 times now, never in water or crazy activity, and when I went to put it on yesterday, the connection to clasp broke open and the chain tumbled down my neck... Luckily, that happened at home, before leaving the house, so i did not lose it, but am disappointed in the quality of the silver connection. Upon inspection ( I make jewelry, myself ), the part that broke open was thin and not adequately joined. I have replacement parts and can eventually repair it myself, but I could not wear it out to my husband's birthday dinner, and now i have to find the time to fix it.
",4
7984,"The ring was beautiful. It was exactly what I hoped for and very cute. It's a small diamond, so it makes a great promise ring if you're not looking to get engaged just yet. I loved it!
",4
7986,"I love this bracelet but it is on small side and hard to put on by myself. However, I like it so much I just don't take it off. Tried to buy extender but the quality of extender not good and don't want to lose bracelet.
",4
7993,"Everything I expected. Wife loves it. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the clasp hard to open.
",4
8005,"Pretty nice bracelet. Looks amazing in the sun. Too big to look real, but you can't tell they are fake otherwise. Setting is a little cheap feeling, but looks good and hasn't broken after like 6 months. Good buy, the wife loves it!
",4
8011,"This is a beautiful bracelet. But if you can make people believe these 6mm CZ stones around your wrist are real you're incredible. This bracelet is appropriate for a formal occasion. Well made. Clasp is superior quality. If you are sure you really like BIG & BOLD you might like this. Apperantly some people think this is ok for every day. I think it's just ok for formal wear.
",4
8014,"If you can't afford the real thing this bracelet is the next best thing. Each cz is set individually and it may be around 10 or 12 karats, although it never really stated how many. If you are looking for something really large this bracelet is for you.
",4
8022,"my wife liked it very much. It catches the light nicely and the clasp is very strong. I was pleasently surprised.
",4
8026,"Lovely bracelet, sparkles like crazy, get lots of nice compliments when I wear. Would recommend to any buyer, looks and is good quality.

8033,"great purchase .... she loved it....i was impressed with the quality.. twas a merry chirstmas... thanks... will visit site again.

8035,"Its so beautiful on her that it makes her feel so gorues. It's worth the money!!! She wants to thank me in so many ways , it's sick!!
",4
8047,"I made the mistake of purchasing this item without paying attention to the dimensions of the product. It is 3/4th's of an inch long but this includes the hook which connects the pendant. The pendant itself is less than half an inch long making for a puny pendant the size of a figaro chain. I had intended to wear it on a chain to represent my heritage, but it was too small to be noticed or considered manly so I gave it to my niece. It is a nice piece however, stamped on one side with the other being flat. The edges are sharp and the silver bright. A nice piece, I just wish it was larger and that the measurement only included the pendant not the hook.
",4
8049,"It's beautiful. It's clean and It looks great. I would of course rather buy http://amzn.to/fsGM7V but considering the cost this is not bad at all :)
",4
8051,"Due to some issues with my wedding band I picked this up as a temporary replacement. I looked around the internet and did my homework and found this ring to be perfect for me. Simple enough to not be obviously CZ. I have to say I adore it! I find it very comfortable to wear, it just feels like a textured band on the hand, nothing jagged at all. The stones are small enough to look real and the metal has a nice color to it, not cheap looking like most silver/cz rings you see at department stores. The only disappointment I had upon receiving it was that the stones weren't as pronounced as the photo. The do seem to be a bit hidden by the metal. Even with that though I'm extremely happy with it and I've had many ooh and ahhs of friends and family. Absolutely worth every penny!
",4
8054,"I really like the look of this ring. It goes well with everything. My only complaint is that it's not the most comfortable ring to wear. Overall though, it's not a bad buy for the money.
",4
8058,"I got two to wear on either side of my 5mm yellow gold wedding band with a 1.3 karat round stone mounted on it. Just wanted a different look than my channel set diamond bands that I have worn on either side for years. At first, I thought the pave bands were too much, and took away from the solitare. I decided to wear them over the weekend with my wedding ring, and now I like them. I have received compliments as well. At first, they felt bulky compared to my other anniversary bands, but now I am used to them and they are comfortable. I am happy with the purchase. A totally different look at a very affordable price. They look much more expensive than they are.
",4
8078,"The pendant is very pretty and is reasonable for that price.However I think the chain is too thin for the pendant.
",4
8081,"Love the pendant, very pretty, nice size stones with bright colors. The chain broke the second day, but that's to be expected - I didn't buy it for the chain anyway. So, buy it for the pretty pendant, and get yourself a better chain.
",4
8082,"Nice piece but you will need to get a new chain for it. Smaller than I expected but nice.
",4
8087,"Ok, when I saw the term dangle - I thought that they dangled - but they are really stationary. That kind of disappointed me, but they are still very pretty and look quite nice when they are on. They are not too heavy - but they have a weight to them, enought to know they are there. I'm glad I purchased them and will look to see what the company offers in the future.
",4
8094,"I am very happy with the pendant, however I feel the chain is sorta filmsy.
",4
8097,"I asked DH to buy these for me for Christmas along with a matching pair of earrings. Both are very nice. I took a star off because the chain was tangled badly when I opened it, it was just loose in the bag. The chain is pretty flimsy but I was already planning to use a longer chain for it than the 18"" chain. The pendant itself is nice, and the velvet pouches and outer boxes are nice presentation.
",4
8099,"Delicate and unassuming, yet classic, this pendant is versatile and will complement any outfit. It looks best against a solid color top.
",4
8103,"These earrings are unique and just plain fun. Interesting colors that surprisingly match a lot of outfits.
",4
8115,"I received this bracelet as a Christmas gift. I put it on and haven't taken it off! It's sturdy, yet lightweight. I love that it has an adjustable clasp for a perfect fit for different size wrists. I also received the matching earrings (also wonderful) and now the matching pendant is on my wish list.
",4
8121,"i recently purchased this item as a gift. It was exactly as pictured and described. It was a major success.
",4
8124,"This bracelet is nice, however, I thought it would be thicker and heavier since I was looking for that type of bracelet. It is very light on the wrist and seems rather delicate. For the price, it's fine but not what I was looking for.
",4
8125,"Bought this, the matching earrings and necklace for a special occasion.When I got it it seem to casual for my event so I returned it. Still the quality and uniqueness were excellent. Considered keeping it, but with Christmas coming, must watch every penny.
",4
8127,"My fiance surprised me on my birthday with a marriage proposal, he asked me at night on the beach so I could not see the ring, but the diamonds sparkle so much I actually saw the sparkling in the moonlight! This ring is gorgeous, it shines and sparkles so nicely the photos on here don't do this ring real justice. This ring also came appraised at over double what it costs here, it's truely a great deal at this price. The center stone on mine actually is .5 ct not .45 ct like the description says here. The only downside to ordering from here, and why I rated 4 stars rather than 5 is that my fiance said the ring took a very long time to deliver (it was delayed beyond their original estimate).
",4
8142,"not real small, the fairy it's self is aout the size of bottle cap and the detale is just whats shown. The face isn't over detaled but its still prity.

",4
8167,"This cross fits my needs for a large noticeable cross dangling around my neck. I have a lot of fun with this cross. The loop on it is large enough to fit my leather cord chain. It is bendable, so one needs to be careful to not put it in harm's way.
",4
8182,"This celtic cross is a great cross i love it wear it all the time have had it for about a month but there just one thing i really dont like and i think some people over shot this little fact that the cross while being cheap it made from some cheap material it bends and sometimes when im working or moving alot the cross will bend and im scared to bnd it back feels a little clumsy but you just have to be careful with it like the other guy said its a real nice cross dont get me wrong just wish it was more durable than this
",4
8183,"The celtic knots inside the cross look pretty nice, for the price you can't beat this thing its a good pendant. But do be careful, it is Pewter so it can bend. I recommend getting some type of silver necklace to go with it and not using the cord, looks cheap.
",4
8187,"Got here in a moderately good amount of time. Decoration was only on one side of the pendant. Otherwise, pretty sturdy.
",4
8188,"The Celtic Irish Crosses I purchased from Amazon are what I expected. Nice and the same as pictured. I would recommend this necklace to anyone who wishes to show their Celtic heritage.

8191,"I ordered three necklaces (one had a broken clasp). This is my favorite of the three. I can wear it with lots of different outfits.

8193,"Bought set of these to take on mission trip to Nicaragua. Huge hit! Nice detail in design. Not mushy looking like similar designs I researched on internet. Nice price too!
",4
8197,"Looks exactly like the picture, is of fine quality and was promptly shipped. The bad news is my girlfriend thought it looked more like a cat then dinosaur, and also thought it too large to really wear. Look at the picture with the pen for scale, this is a large pendant (about 2 inches long) so it won't be everyones style.
",4
8209,"Frankly, I'm just glad to finally have a pentagram necklace. Sadly, it keeps flipping around (regardless of how I put it on). The knot that tied the strig to the loop is warped, and I'm afraid to fiddle with it too much (I don't want it to break). Anyways, It came quickly, is decent sized, and hopefully the warped knot is an isolated irritation. 4 out of 5.
",4
8218,"I love this necklace. The only two issues I have with it is; 1) The way they tied the knot makes the pentacle constantly flip over so the backside is showing. I had to untie the knot before it was fixed and now its fine. 2) This isn't really an issue with the necklace and perhaps I should have said that earlier however the title of the necklace is wrong. This is not a pentagram. Its a pentacle which is a five pointed star contained within a circle. Pentagrams and Pentacles are two different symbols though both are often used in magick. So really the knot was the only issue. The stone in the middle of the necklace is awesome because the way the light hits it, causes it to light up which draws your eyes to the blue stone and the necklace as a whole. The detailed artwork is great too. So this necklace in summary is well worth the money and I look forward to buying more from this retailer.
",4
8221,"The pendant in and of itself is very lovely, as the picture shows. As some have said, the cord is tied a bite awkwardly, but that's an easy fix. Great detail; love the five ""dots"" right by the gem - as well as those around the border - to match the five points/elements. However, the gem is not as shown, at least in my case. This pendant was made to have an empty spot in the center to go with the other five; I received it with a rhinestone/sequens-like ""jewel"" glued into the center hole. (There was even glue smeared across it a bit.) I would pry out the jewel and just leave it be on its own but pewter is so sensitive. Other versions of this pendant are out and about that contain fake gems in the small five holes, too. So, for the lack of a real gem, the price may be a bit steep, but the details of the rest of this piece (and 'free' shipping) make up for it, I think.
",4
8222,"I just got this today. I love it. My only complaint is that the cord it is on is cheap string that flips the necklace around. Other than that I love it.
",4
8226,"Really pretty jade and bright green peridot bracelet. Only issue I had was the clasp didn't feel really secure and I was worried it would slip off and bust on the floor. Going to get a new clasp on it. I'd still buy it again though it's so pretty.
",4
8229,"I bought this for my boyfriend 3 and a half years ago, I bought two rings as I wasn't sure what the size they were on here, you know if one ring seemed too small I'd keep it and give the other one. This was the small ring, it could fit a woman or a really young guy with small fingers. The picture is hard to see as it's bright but it looks pretty cool in person, even with that flower design. The dragon looks good, I loved it, wish it had more bolts though, then the set of two. They came loose after like half a year or so. but you can get new bolts put in, I did in jewelry class, and the ring fit way better after that, more snug and moveable, not tiny bit loose and kind of falling away from finger.
",4
8238,"i loovve this ring! only bad thing is it leaves a tiny mark on my finger which it really shouldn't for the price i paid, but the ring its self is cute! it fits nice and the size is just right =]

8240,"Fits great, sparkles in all lighting. Love it!Closest match to an old marcasite I had that my dog ate so I'm happy to have a such a pretty replacement. Thanks!
",4
8241,"it looks awesome and is very pretty , the only thing i would like is if it had 1 or 2 additional links, as it is a smaller bracelet

8242,"The silver bracelet is very beautiful and the sapphire are on the deep blue side. The diamonds are very small and are not in very leaf. For the Price is was a great buy.

8256,"Great bracelet for a great price. Ive gotten many compliments on it.The stones are beautiful and it is very comfortable to wear.
",4
8261,"The chain is well made and has a nice weight to it. However, for the price, I was disappointed in the lobster clasp. It is very hard to pull back the latch. The stem on it is short and does not pull back easily as a lobster clasp should do and this makes it hard to hook it together.
",4
8266,"I was skeptical ordering jewelry on-line;however, the delivery came promptly. The heart is well crafted and prettier than I expected. I know my mom will love it!
",4
8273,"It's cute and it does go with the earrings I had planned to match them with. I don't know why the list price is $15 as it's all plastic and thin elastic. So far the elastic hasn't popped even though I've worn it many times. As several people said, the ship price is higher than the price of the item.

8277,"`I was needing a reliable and repeatable source for diamond identification. Ceres CZeckpoint has filled the bill for the past twenty years. It's portability has been very beneficial as well as convenient for me to take to shows with me. The competetative price made it affordable and an excellent investment.

8283,"I got these to use as &#34;risers&#34; for various items I display in my home. I would give these 5 stars if they were a bit wider, but that's my fault in not reading the dimensions thoroughly.

The underside has a little solid bar, so it's not as thick, probably making it more comfortable. The peridots are specks of gems, so I'm not sure they are even real stones. It's solid and nice looking, nevertheless. Hope I receive the 4th, as they are needed as gifts for 4. Worth the severely reduced price only, not regular price.

8414,"I like this toe ring when wearing flip flops.I use Arm and Hammer baking soda with water to clean it and the sterling silver stays shiny. I like the fact that this toe ring is adjustable so it fits on any of the four toes except the big toe thumb.It is a comfortable to ring and doesn't scrap the skin between my toes.

8499,"I used to own a cheap two ring set by Tommy Hillfigger that got more comments than rings 100 times the price. Alas, it was cheap: cubic zirconia, enamel colors that faded over time and the jewels fell out. I wanted something to replace it, so the search for an elegant, cheap US flag themed ring led me to this ring. It is higher quality than my last since the band is made of silver alloy, it has cheap jewels and uses enamel that will fade, but that is to be expected since it costs so little. The ring when worn, is very pretty, worth the price, though since the band has a hollow and concave interior it will fit much looser than a typical ring of the same size. I recommend this ring, and it has served me well thus far.

8527,"The Pendant Is Indeed Made Of Stainless Steel, No Doubt About It. But Judging By The Picture, I Would Expected That The Necklace It Self Would't Be Made Out Of Rubber. I Don't know, Maybe I Need To Change My Glasses, Or Maybe You Just Need To Change The Picture. Ether Way, I Don't Want To Return The Item, and I Don't need A Refund, Because It Ain't Such A big Deal. And Who Knows, Maybe We Will Make Better Next Time...

8532,"They've recently changed the picture of this item, it used to be a ring with pastel colored stripes. When I ordered this item I received much more saturated colors, I uploaded pictures of it. I'm not sure if they still ship the one I got, or the one in their new picture, which STILL has different colors than the one I got. It's a cute ring though, reminds me of candy.

",4
8563,"I ordered these for my wife and they look very nice for the price. No, I don't think anyone that looks at them closely will mistake them for diamonds, but they are really just the right size so that most people will believe they are real and not try to look closer.
",4
8564,"These are not small earrings! Personally I think they are too big for a second piercing, which is what I got them for, but I am truly not disappointed. I wear them everyday & they are very comfy! Very well structured, nice snug backs. Lots of sparkle w/out being cheesy. Luuuuv them! (Attaching a pic....I know it helps to see how big ""big"" is!:)
",4
8568,"Based on the previous review, I figured for the price these little earrings would be a great staple in my wardrobe until I can actually afford real diamonds! They're sparkly and from a normal distance I doubt many people would be able to tell that they are not real. They're just the right size, too-if they were any bigger I think everyone would know they were fake because I couldn't afford them, hehe. I would recommend these to anyone that wants ""diamond"" studs but can't afford the real thing, but don't expect them to be identical to a real diamond.
",4
8578,"smaller than what i thought it would be but these gets mistaken for real diamonds, and i get compliments from them when i wear my hair up and my ears visible. The clarity is nice, and the facets are just the right amount. For the price, I definitely love this.

8586,"I got these for my wife and she loves them. As long as she is satisfied so am I.
",4
8589,"Satisfied with my purchase, I feel it is very overpriced but I am happy I purchased a jewelry armoire. I've wanted one for a quite some time but was waiting until I found one that matched my furniture. This one does!Putting it together was simple, even for a girl! ;-)
",4
8592,"I have multiple sets of amber earrings from this company. All beautiful and striking. I always get compliments. On this particular set however I had to adjust the wires a bit so they would hang straight. ( which was not a problem at all for me) Great price, beautiful jewelry.

8599,"These earrings look shiney online, but when you get them they look cheap. Still cute though and very colorful.
",4
8611,"These are cute little earrings that I purchased to have something small and low key in to keep my piercings open without major bling. They are very cute, but are sized more for children. The size of the ball is fine, very small as clearly stated in the description. The post is shorter than big people earrings, so with the clasp clipped on at the ""grab"" line, they were too snug for my fat ol' earlobes. I gave them to my 11 year old daugher and she loves them. They would be perfect for adult ear piercings higher up on the earlobe where there is less ear meat. I was a little concerned when the package arrived--the small box was wrapped up in what was supposed to be a CD mailer. The box was just barely perched inside the intended flat mailer and could have easily slipped out with rough handling. 5 star earrings with a star removed for scary packaging.
",4
8612,"The stones in these earrings are rather small. I guess I should have expected that for the price. They are very pretty, however. I like them because I can wear them with so many outfits! I also bought the matching necklace. I was NOT impressed with the necklace. I honestly don't know who the manufacturer had in mind when they selected the chain for the pendant. It was so small (short) that I seriously doubt if anyone beyond the age of 10 could wear it! I showed it to a friend and she said that her daughter (who is quite petite) couldn't wear a chain that short! But, we're rating the earrings. They are lightweight and not too ""garish"". I believe that they could be worn with casual or more dressy outfits. The stones are small, but perhaps I should say ""subtle"". Very understated!
",4
8628,"it has beatiful sparkles. Nice look, i like. but, the finishing touch is not done perfectly. hope, someone i love will like it.
",4
8635,"I bought this item as a gift for my wedding party. The pendant is very pretty and versatile. The chain is not what I had hoped but it will be okay for this gift. If it were my own, I would probably put the pendant on a different chain. Overall it is very nice and I think a good value.
",4
8636,"I bought this piece as a gift for a quilter, I thought that the design reminded me of crazy quilts. The necklace is great, it has the design on both sides. I would have given the review a five but the chain broke and I had to replace it. Each circle is different and unique making it a great gift for some special. The person that I gave it to, gets constant remarks about how beautiful the piece is. This necklace makes a great gift or a great addition to any jewelry collection!
",4
8637,"The chain on this necklace is a little flimsy and the clasp was off, but the circle pendant is gorgeous. The detail on it is terrific and it really shows off against a light colored fabric. I was really excited to get it because of the blue and red, but all the colors are apparent on it. It looks very delicate and goes with everything in my closet. Love it.
",4
8638,"I love this pendant and have gotten many many compliments on it. Tiny little flowers are formed in a beautiful pattern. Colors vivid and well placed. Only issue was that the chain that came with it turned black from wearing it only a few days. I purchased a shiny nickel/silver chain from Amazon to replace the blackened chain but this added to the cost of the whole set. Still I bought another pendant for my niece when she left for college last month. You will love it too but buy a chain when you buy the pendant and save yourself time.

8669,"One of my fave belly rings. I just bought my 2nd one (seems I lost the 1st when moving) The 1st one held up for me. It didn't lose stones or anything like other people said. 4/5 stars only because it is fashion jewelry. It isn't piercing quality body jewelry that can be left in for a year or whatever. It's for going out then you put your stainless steel ring back in after the weekend. Body piercing professionals will tell you the same to avoid infections... and oh yeah, remember to clean your body jewelry too!
",4
8674,"I bought this bellybutton ring and within days two stones fell out. I contacted Amazon and they replaced it for free. It is a sexy belly ring. I have never seen one close to it in any stores or online. The pink stones go from light to dark which is cool. You can't tell it is in the shape of a heart though unless you get close to it. I added a pink stone ball on the top to replace the silver/metal one it came with, which makes it even better. Overall I am enjoying it.
",4
8680,"I bought this and when I opened it up thought it was the cutest thing ever....but I have only had it for 2 days and already 2 crystals have fallen out. I know that it wasn't that expensive of a piece but two days isn't that long and it's covered up and so it's not getting mishandled. But, the good thing is that it is very hard to tell where the two have fallen out and if you don't point it out to someone I would be surprised if they noticed. I would say that for $15 it's pretty much worth it because it is really cute and I've not seen one like this before.

8718,"I like the bracelet and I think it's beautiful.Just two notes:The blue cristals are paler than I expected.The clasp is not heart shaped and it's very hard to open.Like a lot of other buyers, I already lost one cristal. So the bracelet don't look so special anymore.
",4
8727,"I think this bracelet is cute and because it can go up to 8 inches in length it means you don't have to be really thin for it to fit your wrist.

8735,"My husband bought me this because he knows I like mother of pearl, and I collect silver jewelry, and my favorite color is pink. Can you say perfect?What do you expect for $15? Here's what you'll get with this: an 18"" long sterling silver (Italian-made, I might add) snake chain and a pretty pendant with mother-of-pearl inlay.The pendant is not all perfectly pink; the colors play from beige to pink to lavander, depending on how the light hits each inlay. It's about 1"" long and 3/4"" across. (It's hard to be exact with the measurement because as you can see, it's not your typically symmetrical heart-shape.) The bail is big enough for a layered look, incase you want to put in more than one chain. The back is a solid smooth sterling silver surface, stamped 92.5.And the chain is NOT so thin that you'd have problems with it getting all knotted (if you've had really skinny chain necklaces, you know what I'm talking about). But you do have to be careful with the snake chain. If you're not carefull, you might permanently bend it, and this will affect its fluidity.
",4
8736,"These are really nice, but the one I bought has cheap elastic. This may not be exactly the same, to be fair, because I bought mine in FL at a flea market for $1.00! It sure looks identical, though. I just plan to restring mine if the elastic goes. The elastic on these may be better; I don't know.
",4
8739,"First off, I just want to say that Amazon.com has the best service. I was qualified for the FREE standard shipping which usually takes about 3-9 business days, however I received this necklace in two days!Now the necklace. The necklace pictured is a bit more PINK than my necklace I received. Mine is more light light pink. Almost white pearlish. I was expecting the pearl to be more pink like shown in the picture, but it's okay I still like it. It comes in a beautiful velvet blue box with care instructions.This would make a really nice gift for someone!
",4
8741,"The pink color is very nice. The pearl is quite big and the chain is kinda big too. It should be beautiful but somehow it looks slightly out of place with just about everything I tried....It doesn't look like dress jewlery, but then it doesn't look that well with casual attire either...I tend to think it is because of the chain. Anyways, it looks beautiful by itself!
",4
8752,"People are really getting confuse here, we are talking a review on the Jewelry not a review on Paris.I saw this on a friend and was very delighted to see the good quality and craftsmanship that this item has. I decided to purchase one and I am really impress by the attention it gets.Will consider purchasing other items from her line.
",4
8757,"So cute!!! I thought it would be a little bigger when i got it, but it was still so very cute, although the links on it would come apart sometimes so that was kinda annoying but all an all i love it. But then i lost it so now i gotta buy another one.
",4
8758,"The earrings are gorgeous, but they are too larege for my earlobes. I would like them in a necklace for myself. Stones are very nice.
",4
8771,"I wasn't too sure about this cross, as I am rather particular about style and bling factors.I was pleasently surprized when opening it as it was very pretty and delicate. I am wearing it for work and it seems like it should be OK for casual wear too.Very nice....
",4
8775,"I love this necklace, it's everything I hoped for. I thought it'd be a bit longer, like an actual rosary, but it is still gorgeous. The cross is a bit heavy, but does not irritate my neck at all...(and usually I can't stand to have jewelry on that long unless it's a light chain.)I will definitly be buying more jewelry from this collection soon and I'll let everyone know how the others compare!
",4
8778,"Good thing my wife has two sets of piercings on her ears, these would only fit on the outer ones. They are very small. Seriously... look at the picture. Look at the rod that goes through the ear. It's a normal sized (small) gauge. These are tiny earings. I'm serious.
",4
8796,"The pendant is a good size and the crystals are very sparkly. I don't care for the cord very much, but it is easy to change if you do not like the satin one. The satin begins to unravel/separate after a few wears. I changed it to a silver chain -- there is a good sized opening behind the pendant at the top for the necklace to go through, so most chains should work with this.
",4
8799,"I loved the idem that i recived. although i did not like what the string was made out of it seems somewhat cheep! other then that i loved the colors the lay out and all around good. I Love Paris Hilton!
",4
8817,"I am very satisfied with this item! It's actually 5 stars for me, but I give 4 stars because I think it can go well with you IF your fashion taste and your atmosphere suit this item. I like pink very much and this item matchs my clothes and character and so I can use this frequently. If this item is suitable to your clothes and personality, everybody will praise it and you!
",4
8823,"My mom is buying this for me on my birthday. It is a wonderful accessory, sure to match everything I wear! And I'm kind of glad it says ""Paris"" on it cuz girls think she's hott so if I wear it, it'll be like I'm hott, too! The only reason I give this 4 stars, is because I have to wait for my birthday!
",4
8836,"It's a nice Pendant and it has a beautiful design, but if i can write my name on it would be more beautiful
",4
8838,"These are actually larger than I thought they would be. The stones are vibrant and of excellent quality.The silver work is beautifully intricate. They are very exotic looking. The only thing I would change is the shepherd's hook. It's a bit too long. I would like the earrings to be closer to the ear lobe, and I think the design would work better with a Euro-wire.
",4
8840,"Color was a little pinker than I expected, but service was excellent. And product is also excellent.
",4
8842,"The colour shines bright and looks brighter than a real emerald. They are comfortable earrings to wear and a good size, not to mention a nice price too!
",4
8847,"I just received these in the mail and was delighted that I had purchased the ruby and sapphire color earrings as well. they are a gorgeous color green, sparkle nicely and the price was outstanding. the only thing I would change is that the posts are very short and the backs are very small for those of us with big hands. otherwise, a winner!
",4
8861,"These earrings have a beautiful, clear color. Very pleased with the quality. I bought a pair of sapphire at the same time, and they don't compare. These are my favorites!
",4
8883,"The ring was lovely and delivered on time. However, it was the wrong size. I tried to contact the company and it took them 2 weeks to respond. By then it was past Christmas.
",4
8887,"I wear them with anything that has the slightest bit of blue, and they accent it perfectly. Though the moonstone is not as high of quality as i might have liked, what do you expect for the price. These are beautiful earrings and I get complimented on them all the time. If you are looking for something different than the same old gemstones, this is it!
",4
8892,"I really like these earrings - they are simple, yet elegant. You can use them to dress up a simple outfit. To me they were certainly worth the fair price!
",4
8901,"It's a really great replica however, as others have mentioned, It's smaller than the ones in the movie. The chain is very pretty too! When I'm not wearing it, I leave it out because the whole thing is lovely and very movie accurate.
",4
8935,"I ordered these earrings knowing they would be small. If my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit. These earrings are *really tiny* and do not fit me. I need the next higher up size. These are like 3/8 inch, way small for me and also way difficult to even bend/manipulate to open the hoop.
",4
8948,"These are gorgeous earrings, very detailed. Certainly on the large side of 7mm (closer to 8-9), but still very nice.
",4
8951,"The earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me. I was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire. These earrings were much more flexible that the 25-year-old pair I was replacing. I doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well. However, they do what I need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation.

8996,"Just like the other reviews, I was extremely impressed with how unique and different theFreshwater Cultured Pearl and Peridot Drop Pendant on Silk Cordis. The pearl is large and has a lot of luster. The heart shaped peridot is multi-faceted and adds plenty sparkle. The cord is silky soft and lays perfectly. The only thing I noticed is that the pendant has the tendency to lay off-centered.It is elegant enough to wear with a formal dress and adds pizazz to casual wear such as a tee and jeans. This would also make a wonderful bridesmaids gifts since it comes in so many different colors.Complete the look with matching earrings:Sterling Silver White Freshwater Cultured Pearl Drop Earrings

9088,"I'd asked for a nontraditional engagement ring, ideally with a Sapphire as the center stone instead of a traditional Diamond. My husband, after searching every local jewelry retailer he could think of and not being successful, found this ring online. This is the ring he picked out for me and it's perfect. He was really relieved when it arrived, it looked exactly like it does in the picture. I get compliments on it all the time. It's held up really well, including the finish, and I'm not gentle with jewelry. The only one compliant I have is that I had to get the prongs tightened shortly after I got it, but apparently that is a very common with rings.

9099,"Nice look, no fraying, solid connection to silver clamps unlike many of the rubber tube neclaces.

9107,"i LIKE THIS OK BUT I WISHED I HAD GOTTEN LEATHER BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS WILL LAST VERY LONG
",4
9108,"I would give this a 5 but I worry how long the clasp will stay on the satin, it does not seem adhered too securely. Otherwise this is great for your pendants if you don't want satin you have to tie/untie.
",4
9115,"These are nice, but gauged larger than normal pierced earrings. They are too thick to go through the holes in my ears. I wouldn't have bought them if I had known.
",4
9116,"Looks nice, easy to put in yourself. Looks kinda cheap up close though. Slightly bigger than I wanted and a little on the ostentatious side.
",4
9121,"I get a lot of compliments on this ring!! as you can see, it's just an interesting, neat ring. Only thing is the sizes are a little small. I ordered a size six for my middle finger, and it wont fit at all. but it fits nicely on my ring finger, which is a 5. i contacted the seller, and she said she would ship me a replacement once i returned the ring. But, i decided to keep the smaller size b/c it just looks so nice. It's just nice to know they are accommodating. Also, the ""cutting out"", or scroll work is not as, i guess ""clean lined"", making it look a little more handmade, but i like it. all in all, i love it and it gets a lot of attention.
",4
9152,"I purchased a silver rose ring by the same seller. I bought a month ago, but only put it in a couple of days ago. Since I've been wearing it, the rose petals on the ring, dig into the lower part of my belly button, leaving red marks. Don't get me wrong, I love the ring, but I have to sit up all the time to avoid the redness. I love this ring.
",4
9160,"Like the previous reviewer said, the bar is too long. I had to change mine too but it does not screw back as nicely so it's always a little loose when I wear it. It's fine though, doesn't fall off, and the color is so rich and sexy, I just love it, and I think guys do too :-) Very nice!
",4
9177,"It is pretty nice, it looks and feels like there is leather inside, and the ""wood"" is decent. Only problem for me was that the slot for the ring is very skinny. It will only fit one ring, so if you plan on having the engagement ring and wedding ring in there it is pretty tricky.
",4
9182,"I bought this box to replace one that I received from the jeweler. Seeing that I had spent so much for such a nice ring, I didn't want to ruin the presentation with a crappy box. This one is definitely much better quality and has a better appearance than the one that came with the ring. I only have two complaints about the box: 1. The ring holder holds the ring in a vertical position. This is personal preference, but I think the ring would look better angled. 2. The wood is so heavily shellacked that it almost appears that it's not wood at all. Opening up the box and removing some of the padding reveals it is actual wood, but without checking it has the shine and weight of something made of plastic. Despite these two minor complaints, I'm quite happy with the purchase.

9209,"i've bought these earrings as a christmas gift for my co-worker and she absolutely loved them. the pair came in a cute little pouch and was absolutely immaculate with very nice deep colors and detailed golden outlines. i think earrings will look even better over the time when the earwires get slighly tarnished
",4
9210,"I was drawn to these earrings at first sight. I love the beautiful contrast of the colors and how the clasp adds to its appeal. The size is perfect and both sides have the same picture. I would've given a 3.5 because on one side of the earring, the gold appears moderately dulled/lacking in luster (gold) when compared to the other 3 sides. All in all, I give it a 4 because of it's uniqueness and it was the first time my boyfriend complimented me on them.
",4
9218,"These earrings are really pretty but bigger than what I expected, hence the 4 stars. I have received compliments whenever I have worn them and overall am very pleased with this perchase. How could you go wrong at this price?! The only other issue I have with them is that the hooks are silver yet the decoratative color around the edges of the beads are gold, not the best match, should have been silver also, but really not too important an issue.
",4
9232,"Beautiful band, much nicer then I thought it was going to be. My husband gets compliments almost weekly, and says it is very comfortable. The only thing we do not like about it, is that it cannot be sized. Small price to pay, for such a comfortable, and beautiful, yet masculine ring.

9241,"The earrings were very nice. The only complaint is that they looked a little cheaper than I had hoped. however, they were wrapped beautifully and my friend loved them. Great service, fast shipping.

9243,"The photo has a much different appearance from the actual product. The frog ring is very nice, but will not look like the photo. I was disappointed because I wanted the rustic appearance shown and not the classy ring I received.

9245,"Excellent craftsmanship. Price more than reasonable. Earrings are small for an adult, but perfect for a young lover of horses. Posts were a bit long. Delivery was unbelievably prompt.

9249,"These are nice small stud earrings that fit perfectly with a necklace we already have. It's nice to find something at a low cost. Thanks for sending them so promptly.
",4
9265,"I bought this as a gift for a niece turning one. The size and type of fastener (screw, not pressure plate) were ideal for this particular setting. The gems look nice and the recipients were satisfied with the quality. I would say it was good value for the price.
",4
9284,"i was really excited to get the ring in the mail...i actually ordered another ring from ebay at the same time, and this one came in first! however like the second time i wore it the cherry part fell off...i fixed it with super glue...but who knows how long it will last this time...
",4
9286,"I bought this as a gift back in October 2012, and it was very small. It looked beautiful and I think my friend really enjoyed it. It does not come with a chain or anything to hang it on, so having a small silver chain would be ideal if you would like to wear this as a necklace. I was surprised how much color was showed, but it should be noted it does NOT look EXACTLY like it does in the picture. Still beautiful and I haven't heard any negative comments so far.P.S. This pendant also came in a very cute box, which made it look great as a gift!
",4
9296,"The pendant is very pretty -- almost as pretty as the picture makes it appear. It's smaller and thinner than I'd expected but that's my own fault for not looking up the product dimensions. Facets are slightly more angular than the picture suggests. And the colors don't blend into one another quite as smoothly as the colors in the Amazon picture.The bigger issue: anyone buying this product on the virtue of these reviews should be aware that whenever Gem Avenue receives a positive seller rating, they request that their buyers review the products positively as well. Therefore, the reviews that appear here are skewed to reflect the buyers who liked the product, not those who didn't.I, for one, liked the product. But caveat emptor.

9305,"These were really cute earrings...my only drawback would be my hair tends to get caught on them often. The setting sticks out a bit farther than I kind of like but overall a nice pair of earrings for the price

9317,"I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my wife, so I obviously haven't seen her reaction yet, but it's a very nice piece. It arrived quickly and was reasonably priced.
",4
9320,"The earrings themselves are cute and a nice size, but the color was not what I expected. They look much more magenta than ""ruby red"". All in all, a disappointment on color but I won't return them.

9344,"These earrings are very attractive. They sparkle! Also they go with both gold and silver jewelry as both colors are in the earrings.

9351,"If you like gold and shiney, then you'll love these earrings. They are very comfortable to wear. My only complaint is that sometimes the dangle drop gets hung up by its connector ring.
",4
9359,"The actual product, i.e. the pearls are terrific, but if you plan on giving this as a gift - the box they come in could use some improvement. Otherwise the quality of the actual product is good.

9369,"I purchased a necklace and earring set from Augustine Jewelry, so I thought I would buy this bracelet to complete the set for my wife. I'm no jeweler, but the quality does not seem to compare to the other set, even though they are both rated as AAA.

9370,"I was pleased with the earrings. For the price, it was a good buy.
",4
9373,"this chain is beautiful and made a perfect addition to a silver pendant for my wife for our anniversary. Could not be happier!
",4
9377,"I bought several months ago and wear it once a week at least. It's a little pricy compared to its quality (especially chain looks cheap), but still worth to buy it. The design is so unique!
",4
9379,"The pendant itself was very beautiful! The chain was also equally beautiful but was so small though! I bought it for an eleven year old girl and the chain was so small it wouldn't reach. She is a normal sized girl without a weight problem so her size was not the issue. If you buy this for a little girl older than 5 I would recommend buying a larger chain to go with it.
",4
9382,"The chain is smaller than I thought it would be, but the necklace is very pretty. If you are looking for a gift for someone with simple tastes I highly recommend this.
",4
9385,"I like this necklace. It looks pretty, but my only complaint was that the quality of this ""sterling silver"" doesn't look quite as good as the ones I've had many times. It looked just a little bit different, like if it was a bit cheaper.. Other than that, I think this would make a nice gift for a girl. :)
",4
9390,"I was hoping it would be a identical to the large flower. It wasn't. The necklace is not as open as it seemed but still pretty.
",4
9393,"I bought this necklace because the flowers matched my prom dress perfectly. It is quite cute and the pendant is of a decent size. However, the price is a little steep-$24- for a silver pendant. The chain is also short, but then, I am 18 and the necklace is meant for a young girl.
",4
9398,"Purchased this as a flower girl gift for my 7 year old niece. It's perfect for the occasion, and very age appropriate.

9403,"Met all expectations on Christmas morning. perfect length for 6 yo. Chain is very fine, so it's worn for special occasions.
",4
9409,"maybe I didn't do my research but it was supper tiny! really cute though! For the price it was fine though and my father in law loved it.
",4
9422,"Great ring, looks great and my girlfriend loves it, the only problem is with the 14K gold, it's a little bit weak and has caused the band to bend a little bit in a location, maybe try switching to 10k gold for a little more strength. Other than that, it's perfect.
",4
9444,"The ring is awesome. Pattern is practically identical to the picture. My only issue was I ordered the ring a bigger size, because I heard it ran little small, but my ring came just right and ended up being just a tad loose, so I'd recommend buying your regular size and if it doesn't fit, there is an exchange policy, which I think is great!
",4
9452,"These earrings are rather dainty, just the right size for everyday wear and could even go dressy. The Ross-Simons name backs up the quality. The pair I received are on the greenish side, which makes me very happy.
",4
9454,"I considered sending it back for a little bit. I'm not thrilled about it being one sided, and it's a little light on weight. I like some elements of it being concave, it lays well and is the diameter of a nickle. I've loved the peace sign since the late 60's & have been searching for a 14kt gold one.....I'm enjoying it.Toni Campbell
",4
9459,"I ordered this charm and was overall... pleased with it. My only complaint was that it is just a little too small. I really wish it would have been at least another 1/2 inch larger. The pendant is rather well detailed especially for it's size and, looks good on a serpentine chain. I'm wearing it now, and usually have several compliments on it each week.If, you have an appreciation for history and or, ancient Rome....I suggest you get one and wear it with pride.

9462,"I bought these for my mom who doesn't like heavy earrings. They were perfect and a nice size. I loved the quality of them too.

9481,"I saw the exact charm at Kay Jeweler's at the local mall for a lot more money. I liked it a lot, but it was too expensive. Glad I checked with Amazon.com. Great buy!

9489,"The necklace was to go with a locket I had purchased from another website. The description was very accurate for the measurements. It arrived within 3 days. This was a gift and I was pleased to give it to the recipient.
",4
9496,"I bought these earrings for my 15 yr old daughter, who is tough to buy for, and she loves them. They are very pretty and yet a touch edgy, the quality is acceptable, and with the on sale discount, the price was fair.

9498,"It's cute, VERY cute, but the little dangling jewels kinda hide out in my belly button. So, they don't dangle so much.

9500,"Nice medium weight chain. You could use it with pendents but not really small ones. Has a nice finish. Good to wear alone.

9520,"Purchased these to match a ring I got for my girlfriend and they look great with the ring. She loves to wear them. Triangle thing is somewhat weird, but overall it is good.Update Feb. 2012: Said girlfriend is now my wife and she still wears ""the trifecta"" (I got her a matching Garnet ring). She gets many compliments about her earrings and they have held up very well over the last three years. I would recommend these earrings any day. Make your lady happy :)
",4
9533,"bought this for my 18 yr.old daughter and she loves it. It is really hard to find a crown ring that isn't tiny. this is not tiny. it is a little bulky for someone with a thin finger. she wears a 5 and it is a little on the big side but she likes it. the only down faults is it is not very shiny. it's sorta dull, not shiny like sterling silver should be. but it is worth the price.
",4
9538,"Read the dimensions carefully. Its tiny but can be won as a pendant. The color is lighter than I had hoped for but it looks classic.
",4
9576,"This anklet is much more beautiful in person, than the extreme closeup shows. It is sturdy, yet dainty, and the white gold beads really sparkle. I would warn the buyer, however, that the 10"" advertised length includes a one-inch length of weaker extender chain. The actual length of the sturdy beaded part is only 9"". So, if you are wanting to wear it without ever taking it off, and you may want to measure your ankle before buying to decide if this is actually the anklet for you.

9604,"My granddaughter is very involved with volleyball and I was searching for something special for her. I found the Tiger Eye volleyball braclet and ordered it hoping it would please her...she is 15. She loved it! I thought it might be too small but she wears it nicely.

9605,"Ever since I began watching the Decorah eagles on UStream, I have become an eagle addict. This pin was perfect and matched description, but I needed a larger one with a little more bling, so that's my fault. Hats off to the seller, though!

9606,"The glowsticks did what they were supposed to! Nice bright blue glow!Well packaged and delivered very promptly and efficiently.Only concern is that since (once activated) they contain broken glass, they are potentially a liability with young kids who are intent on chewing and bending them beyond their limitations...!It would be helpful if the packaging could be labelled with clearer warnings of whether the glowsticks contain toxic chemicals and whether (if chewed till severed) ingestion of contents is likely to be dangerous (besides the risks of the broken glass)!
",4
9610,"These came in a tube, so they were secure in shipping. The shipping cost was ridiculous from the vendor. They were a good blue hue when they glowed + lasted all night. It came with a bag of bracelet connectors that were easy to use, but easy to lose/drop so had to be careful. Overall they were great for a large party + kids really liked them alot. Much cheaper than the store + would buy again if the shipping cost was more reasonable.
",4
9612,"I ordered these for my classes Synchronized Swimming performance. They were wonderful, even though we had way to many for the first performance. We cracked them about an hour before the performance and they made it all the way through (this was for our last song).My only problem was that the connectors that were included had issues holding the sticks, not sure if it was the connector or our fault. Also some of the connectors ended up getting a slit in them making them useless.Over all wonderful product and made our performance so much better.(meant to put this on the green one as well) If frozen over night they can be used again but it should be within 24-48 hours, we pushed it a week and they did not reuse as well.
",4
9614,"These work great, they last a long time, and the colors are very vibrant. The only issue I had was it took a week longer than I expected to get the order - be sure to give yourself extra time (a week or so) if you are buying these for a specific event. The order actually arrived on the end day of the ""will arrive between X and Y"", but that meant I got it almost 10 days after the earliest time that they indicated (X and Y were 10 days apart).
",4
9619,"I do really like this necklace. It is very attractive and goes with so many things. The only problem is that I have to be very careful of it because the clasp comes undone very easily. It comes off practically every time I lift off a scarf, for example.

9646,"I gave these to the best men at my wedding. I had two best men on account of having two brothers. The cufflinks look great. They are quite nice, and well constructed. They aren't flashy in a bad way, although the box they came in was dull in a bad way.

9680,"I collect pewter lapel pins, so I am always looking for ones that are well made. I like this pin for that reason and the detail. It's thick and the backing is very solid.

9684,"These are pretty earrings, well matched with a rich blue color and just a bit of the starry night shimmer that I love about lapis. They were a bit more expensive than other lapis earrings I have seen, but these are well made and exactly the oval shape I wanted. The gold posts are not inserted directly into the stone like most stud earrings, but are a part of the gold frame around the entire stone. Very impressive.

9712,"I purchesed this for my girlfriend for her birthday, and she has enjoyed it ever since. The delicate nature of the product is great for people who like that type of necklace, but it may not suit everyone, and there is always the fear of the chain breaking. For the price and the quality, this is a worthwhile item to purchase.

9718,"I bought this as an averyday pendant for my girlfriend and its perfect. not to big so that it looks like bling but just good enough for it to get noticed and praised. It's a great little gift and the chain does not look cheap. it came in a nice jewelry box and very protected packaging. NOTE: SHIPPING TO CANADA WAS 35$ PLUS FEDEX CHARGED ME !0,49$ EXTRA! Apart from that, its a good deal.

9720,"I think this necklace is beautiful for the price!!! I wasn't expecting greatness, but it was worth the price. I wear it everyday and I haven't had any problems with it. (I bought it when it was only $50)
",4
9725,"I got this Pendant for my girlfriend as a Christmas present. She really liked, however it is small, but that is kinda why we both liked it, not too bulky. Unfortunately the chain is super thin and broke within the first few days. She had it repaired on her own but it broke again within a week. She decided to just buy stronger chain that would fit the Heart pendant.

9727,"The item looks great but note that it is extremely small. There are length sizes on here but if you look at the picture too much it make you believe the product is bigger than what it truly is.

9738,"The pendant is a little small but over all nice size diamond and good quality for the price.
",4
9741,"The necklace is nice, though a bit smaller than you might think. I would like to point out, however, that you can NOT actually have it at the angle shown in the picture. The chain clasps are too big to allow it. in fact, contrary to one review, you can only hang it one way, which is ""straight,"" which is put in quotes because it actually still hangs at a slight angle due to the shape of the pendant. Actually, I lied, you can hang it sideways (not just angled, but SIDEWAYS) if you want, but...not really attractive in my opinion. It's a pity, because i thought the angle the picture showed was really nice, and although the straight is still nice, it is not AS nice.
",4
9745,"The strand is exactly as pictured. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I thought the nacre feel on my teeth would be the same as a real pearl (since they used the same pearl material). I always rub pearls on my teeth to see if they are real, a trick I learned from a jeweler. So, having said that, these are along the quality lines of Majorica and other nice costume jewelry. I wanted a gray pearl necklace, and this faux version will suffice until I save up for a real one. The knots between each pearl add a nice touch, there is a nice weight to the necklace, and the clasp is nice (albeit sterling silver). Nice for the price.
",4
9751,"The bracelet was a little narrower than I expected (this one was the medium thick Singapore). It seems like parts of the bracelet straighten out temporarily as you wear it, which is disappointing because I like the twisted look (I bought it to go with a necklace from another vendor). The price was very good, and the bracelet goes with the necklace well, so I will keep it.

There are lots of ladies in my family, young and old, who receive Christmas gifts from me along with a little cash (depending on if they have been ""naughty or nice"".) My plan is to give all of the ladies a pair of Xmas-red garnet earrings with some cash tucked into the earring box. Isn't that a much warmer gesture than the rather cold ""money envelope?""(Check out the price of Hallmark-type cards & envelopes these days - expensive!)This style of garnet earring will be perfect for some on my list (I purchased three pairs).The garnets in these earrings had very good color, although the silver was thin. They are very light and will not drag down the ear. Super deal for the price ($9.99 on special)! The adorable gift boxes are perfect for holding the ""Granny Bucks"" with the earrings.People might not remember money gifts, but they will remember jewelry!

It came with directions to reassemble it, but they are far from clear. After half an hour we got it back together. It's not that hard once you figure out how to do it. Better descriptions of the individual rings in the instructions would help.

It's the first time I tried a spiral twist and it was a bit harder to insert. My only complaint is that the screw ball fastener is plastic and the twist is metal, so it's not going to last that long, but for the price, it's worth the short time.

9864,"Really beautiful ring though the teardrops contain imperfections so symmetric to be real and make the amber look as fake. The green color is obtained applying a coat of something at the base.

9867,"I was satisfied with the ring, but for some reason I thought it would be a little bigger. It has nice gems, and is really a nice quality ring. Wish Amazon would model their rings on hand models so that one would have some idea of the size of the ring, especially when there is no carat weight listed.

9971,"this chain although very fine is also very beautiful. I was not sure what size the links would be before I purchased it. I would go for bigger links, but I do love the design. I would purchase the same design again, but in a bigger link.

I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars instead of 4!****************************This is a beautiful chain for a pendant (or like me, a Saint's medal!). It has a lovely intricate design that I haven't seen before and is quite stunning. The chain is a tad bit shiny, so keep that in mind. I've worn mine solidly for a month now, take showers & sleep in it, and it's still holding up, as is my 6 year old daughter's chain, who also wears it sleeping, playing, and all that rough stuff that kids do. Neither one has shown any signs of weakness and for the price, I highly recommend it.The only flaw I saw was that one or two tiny links were ""bunched"" up with each other, I was able to fix all but one by simply pulling them and trying to wiggle it. I still haven't fixed the last one but I am afraid to break the chain, and since it is minor it's staying. I would recommend the chain more for women than men, although if your man isn't particularly picky.... it seems more feminine to me with the fancy design.I plan on buying more for my other children when I get around to it!!
",4
10026,"My set has been with me for two years and I love them. As with all dangle earrings their uses are quite specific and the color white shown in the picture is more of an ivory that is hard to match with my skin tone. Still very pretty when I get the change to wear them, and my boyfriend compliments every time which is nice considering he's not prone to noticing the little things. The bottoms hang down to the place my jaw meets my neck which leads to a very graceful line and compliments bone structure without being over bearing. Still they manage to be statements by themselves. A drawback of that is I have yet to find a necklace that you could put on with these without feeling overdone or part way into costume. The hook on one earring disconnected after about year while getting snagged in my hair, but I just picked it up and used pliers to retighten. Hooks getting bent out of shape with use is nothing new, or surprising, but it means they aren't peak quality either.

10105,"These earrings are a nice size and the quality is there. However the backs are too small and cheaply made. I switched the backs from another pair of earrings and they worked fine.

10144,"I purchased these at $16 in December 2006; they are currently running for $15, which is so worth it for 14K white gold earrings. At this price you should be thinking about next year's Christmas presents. Otherwise, if you are looking for a treat for yourself, you will not be disappointed. The reason they lose a star with me is that for the 7mm size, the earring backs should be larger; they are on the small side.
",4
10148,"the ball earrings are beautiful and they look great on my wife! only complaint would be that the tension backs are tiny (and, therefore, hard to handle and find) but you could just replace them with tension backs from your unused earrings.
",4
10150,"These were a great earring for the price. If backing is loose change for another. Great Shine and Polish to them.
",4
10156,"These are ok, but the felt a little loose and were too small for the look i wanted. I have to say the color is really good though, the picture makes them look a little dark but they are very pretty.
",4
10160,"I bought these earring hoops when they were on 60% sale. Cost me about $76. When they arrived, I was very disappointed by the quality of the diamonds---no sparkle at all. Also, it hard to put on as well --- the needles are incredibly thick, and the end is dull --- it pained my ears a lot. I took them to a jeweler and got them checked. It turned out that diamonds on them are real, just poor quality. The jeweler sharpened the tips for me so its easier for me to put them on. I am a little bit happier with them now, and since they do look elegantly on my ears, I regard my goal achieved. I give this product 4 stars because they came in right Amazon's description.
",4
10163,"Bought it three weeks ago, We had to exchange it because the size was too big. Be careful to check the size a second or third time when ordering rings as the tab down is touchy. The ring is a real good prduct for the price. The gold is a little too gold though,silver would probably look more ""real"" but for a substitute ring or just something safer to wear when you don't want to lose your best, this works real fine. Don't think that a 35.00 ring is going to be confused for a 3,500.00 ring, it just ain't going to happen but for a night out or at the beach or park it is perfect.
",4
10166,"Came with scratches on the faces; however, the engraving makes up for it. No one will really notice them once they're shined up for the big day! Solid construction and not too bad of a turnaround time. Fair price too.
",4
10167,"Excellent product but it catches and tangles my longer hair. I still wear it because I like it and it looks great with my outfits.
",4
10170,"Promptly shipped, nicely packaged, with clear documentation. Stones received were in the lower end of the described range: Color I and Clarity SI2. After Amazon's jewelry sale of 40% discount, the $3800 purchase price seemed to be about the same as Blue Nile or a retail store. Happy with purchase, easily done online, good return policy, but no great bargain.
",4
10171,"It had been a tough couple of years for my wife of 21 years and me but she stuck with me when many women probably would not have. Now stronger than ever it seemed like an important time to emphasize just how much my wife's strength and love meant to me, thus the opening for a rather extravagant gift. I was concerned that she might think that she already had more than enough jewelery or that the financial outlay might be a turn off...Forget it. Her eyes lit up like the gleam of these little sparklers and it was immediately clear that I'd made the right call. The earrings are beautiful and at least as good as advertised. The stones are bright and clear and reflect light beautifully. The mountings are top quality with secure closures. A great decision to buy.
",4
10195,"The worst thing about this ring case was the annoying ""made in china"" label. Once I got past that, though, I felt the quality is quite good, the slots are adequate for all the men's rings I placed into it, and the padding is attractive. Additionally, it closes tight and firm, and the little lock works fine.I think it's worth the price and has certainly organized my ring collection in an attractive way.
",4
10208,"I have recently become ""ring insane"" and thought buying tons of rings would somehow make me flashy. I became flashy but also unorganized when I couldn't find any rings because I had them scattered all over the place. That's when this ring box came to the rescue... Not only does it house the larger rings I own, it also is slim enough to be tucked into a drawer. I plan on buying another one as soon as I've filled up the first one - which should be later this month.
",4
10213,"The value vs. the cost was balanced well & I feel that I got a decent product for the asking price. I was interested to find that it included a basic lock (key included), though I did have to reshape and file the edges of the key in order to actually use it. It didn't take much work to accomplish and it holds every last ring securely, from the smallest (I have small hands, so I have trouble with jewelry cases, as they often swallow my smaller rings) to the largest, including an adjustable sheath-style ring with 2 ring bands and a set of 3 nesting chevron-style rings. It holds each ring securely so that you don't have to worry about any slipping out of place if the case gets tipped over when transporting. It's not the highest quality but it's more than fair for the cost.
",4
10216,"Purchased this case for a friend to display some award pins and medals. It fit the job perfectly. Interior and outer fabic nicely fitted. The two halves align well and it`s even lockable. It`s about 12 inches by 8 inches. Price was good. Delivery was fast and accurate. ( You can always fill it with gold and silver jewelry if you desire )
",4
10218,"I like the case. It's well made. I do have to ""push"" my wide rings down into the foam slits to get them in. I would say after time that the foam will get the memory of the wide rings and be sloppy for narrow ones, but I can live with that. I would buy again considering price and quality.
",4
10225,"i am very pleased with the 2 ring boxes irecently ordered. i have been going a little crazy on ebay buying lots of silver rings, and these boxes make it a lot easier to find what i want to wear each day!!!

10238,"I have never had a box to put my rings into until now.. I am surprised that my wide rings fit so well.....I wear large sizes up to size l4. The case takes up little space and is lockable. Looks good too; very understated. I would suggest purchasing the case.
",4
10239,"The case is very beautiful,the interior is velvet and makes the whole case look very nice, but the only thing that dissapointed me was the fact that the ring spaces are wide enough but not deep enough. My rings kept popping up. Other than that the case its beautiful!

Not a big deal. I have had it over a month and wear it at least 3 times a week but I keep noticing the clear elactic bands are slowly breaking.You get what you pay for!! It still helps me to read it however.

10307,"I have wanted several pair of lapis earrings -different styles but not ones that one would find in a ""regular"" jewelry store or catalog. I found one pair when i went on a trip to Turkey last year that were unusual. Since i won't be traveling anytime soon, I checked Amazon as i have bought a number of jewelry items and have been vey pleased.I purchased this earrings from Amazon. There was a good description and could enhance the picture of them so i could really see how they looked. When i received the earrings, i was not disappointed. The 3 ""stones"" were each a slightly different shape and different hues of blue. i love them and have received compliments whenever i wear them. The price was very reasonable. Margo Rice. (I didn't proof read this email)

10312,"This charm is way smaller than I anticipated-I was thinking penny-sized and it's the size of my pinky fingernail. It's really beautiful though and I will keep it, it will look good on a delicate silver chain.

10354,"I bought the Mizpah Medal and Necklace set as a gift for my wife. We have always talked about how appropriate they are for committed couples. I was very pleased at her reaction when she opened her gift. The medals aren't huge or gaudy looking, they are about the size of a nickel. The necklaces are definitely silver as I have worn one since the day that she opened them. It has been through many showers and basketball games without discoloration or tarnish.For the price, you can't go wrong with this purchase. Delivery was quick. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend this item to Amazon shoppers in love.

",4
10368,"I was VERY excited when I saw these! & it looks just like the picture. Charms are a little small & thin. But over all I am satisfied. I think maybe it is priced a little high, for the quality of the charms. Chains are very good quality.(Stainless steel) Charms are fair. (Sterling silver) I'm hoping they can be worn at all times, & don't tarnish too fast or rust.
",4
10372,"The idea is a good one however the item is very small and quite difficult to read. Not sure why chains are different lengths.
",4
10373,"I bought it for my girlfriend (and myself). She loves it, though, I have to say that it is not so nice. It gets scratched very fast and the little thing where you close and open it (I forgot the word, sorry) is not sterling silver; thus, oxidizes. The box it came with is pretty but gets ruined when taking off the tape. Nice as a gift if it is not going to be used often. But seriously, if you can, add some bucks and get something better.Overall 4 stars.

10374,"Beautiful piece of jewelry- but just so you know- Jacob was actually telling Laban ""The Lord better keep between us, or I'm bringing the pain down on you!"" (my paraphrase) Jacob had worked for his uncle for 20 years, the first seven through the deception of Laban who substituted his other daughter to marry Jacob. Here is the account of their parting:36And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?37Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.38This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.39That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.40Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.41Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.42Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.43And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?44Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.46And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.47And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.48And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;49And Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.50If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.51And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;52This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.53The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.54Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.55And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.

10402,"I bought it for them as a Christmas present and definitely loved the quality of the metals and the length and sturdiness of the chains. It was a perfect gift the only reason I give it 4/5 stars is because I thought the halves would be a little bit bigger and heavier. Overall a quality product!
",4
10407,"I opened package and was pleasantly surprised by how well made both necklaces were. I am giving it as an anniversary gift to my husband. It is a necklace I can see us both wearing daily. Strong and sturdy chain. Great look and meaning behind the necklace. Good buy! Wanted to add I gave it to my husband and he loved it and has not taken it off yet. Either have I!

10411,"The necklaces are beautiful & shiny. Yes the pendants are small, but I think it's in a good way. I am extremely happy with this purchase!! I will rate this item again in a few weeks after we've worn them for awhile. I absolutely recommend this product to eveybody!!

10434,"My boyfriend got this for me for christmas. With me starting at University we were unsure of how our relationship would fare. He bought this as a reminder that no matter whereever we are, near or far, that we have each other. For us this was a major step towards a serious relationship.This necklace is not intended for 24/7 wear. I was able to wear it for a month before the chain broke but I am hard on necklaces.I would definitely suggest this gift for other couples. My sister and her boyfriend have the same necklaces and they go to schools that are on different ends of the state. The constant reminder helps them when they are missing each other.
",4
10439,"I was happy overall with the product. My major disappointment was that the words were difficult to read when the pendant was together, impossible to discern when apart.
",4
10440,"I gave this to my long distance boyfriend for our 6 month anniversary. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry that helps keep us feeling a little closer despite the distance between us. The only problem we have had with the item... his piece of the mizpah coin came off the chain when the ring separated. We were able to find it and he used some plyers to close down that ring a little more. So before you present this to someone, you may want to check and make sure that those rings that keep the coins on the chains doesn't have an opening in it. We've both worn ours ever since we got them including showers, etc and neither of us have experienced any tarnishing or anything. So for me, it's been worth the money.

10483,"I ordered this for my niece for Christmas. I haven't given it to her yet, but I'm sure she will love it. It does not seem super-sturdy, but should hold up fine, as it's more of a keepsake than a toy. It arrived in good shape and worked fine right out of the box. It seems like a good gift option for a small girl (my niece is 5) who is into the ""princess"" theme.
",4
10484,"I purchased this jewelry box for my daughter because it reminded me of the one I had as a little girl. This is however, not quite as sturdy as the one I had. It is very pretty with the scenery on every side, but it is very lightweight and the outside covering is a type of coated paper. My daughter is very careful with the box, so it is still in perfect shape. I'm not sure how long it would last with someone who does not take care of her things. The music still works perfectly and she's had it since last Christmas. Keep in mind that it is quite small. I purchased it mainly because it is pretty and reminded me of my own, not because I thought she could store a lot of jewelry in it. I actually don't think she has any jewelry in it at all. She just enjoys raising the lid to listen to the music and watch the dancers.
",4
10502,"I hoped for more 'sparkle' considering the quality specified. But then they are small. Some online sellers provide a written certification of quality, but not Amazon. My wife wouldn't let me send them back, and she give them 4 stars. They fit comfortably and securely.

10510,"The earrings are beautiful and detailed and a real value for the price. Considering that, you may want to check to make sure that all of the attachments (rings that connect each piece together) are secure. One of the earrings had a loose connection that required an easy adjustment.

10519,"I wasn't really planning on buying this but when I added it to my shopping cart, the price was about 15 dollars cheaper! So I decided that the price was right. It comes in a plain, dark blue velvet box and with an extra box for gift wrapping if necessary. The pendant is quite small and dainty. If you don't know diamonds, this one is tiny and looks more like glass. I recommend this necklace as a ""just because"" gift and not a birthday, anniversary, Xmas, Valentines, etc. gift. It is a very basic necklace that is a great alternative to flowers! ;)

10562,"Quality of leather looks nice. I can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off. It's metal squeazed to leather and that's what I expected. You just have to keep an eye on it and don't sleep or shower in it. It looks nice.

10563,"I just got my 20 inch leather cord sterling silver necklace today, opened it up and quite surprised the see a good quality product for the price. I ordered this cord as to go with a medallion pendant I ordered from Amazon.com! I think this new 20 inch cord is going to do the trick, for I felt that the 16 inch leather cord that comes with the pendant was going to be to small. Glad I did, for this 20 inch just rests where my neck meets my chest, about an inch bellow my atoms apple, it will definitely work. The only air of concern I have with this necklace is those sterling silver ends. For now the clasp system will probably hold up for a great long while, but the wield or solder point that connects the o-ring to the leather cord, where the clasp connects by clasping the opposing end, it's material there is pretty thin. Now I'm just looking forward in getting the rest of my order from Amazon.com, as to complete this new leather cord necklace. And as far as ""wait time"" for the necklace to be delivered, it was right on time!

10607,"The item was not quite what I was expecting. Although I knew that the length of the necklace was 16 inches, not seeing the whole necklace in the picture, I assumed that the links of jade were going to be bigger. I was expecting a little more substancial piece. But, after I put the necklace on and wore it for awhile, I was rather surprised by how well the size matching of the jade to the legnth of the overall &quot;fit&quot; the necklace rather well, and it was weighted perfectly. It was a comfortable piece to wear and I grew to love it more after actually wearing it. A thing that I love that I don't think is mentioned is the clasp on the actual dragon is such that it can be removed from this necklace and put on other large necklaces. I have not tried moving it to a strand of pearls, but I would think that it might work!I am giving it a four out of five because of that initial impression was not earth moving, but the piece is really quite nice. If I wear it more and grow to love it more, I may regret not giving it a five!

At first I was annoyed with how to put in a picture which is why gave the product a 4, I have however figured out how to do it. Basically cut out a picture in the shape of the heart's interior and slide it under the top part of the heart ( the downward point \/ ) hope that make sense. Practice with a piece of paper first.

10719,"Considering the price, this is a pretty good find. The only real complaints I have are that it's much smaller than the picture would have you believe and that it's very difficult to open without damaging. If you plan on keeping pictures in it, make sure you have them in the smallest size available, and be careful when openeing it.

10724,"It is hard to open and close but it is so beautiful. It goes perfectly with my girlfriend's complexion. We are both so happy I found this locket.
",4
10727,"I just received the necklace today, I bought it as a valentines gift for my girlfriend and I'm sure she'll love it. I've read many reviews on this and it seems people are having troubles putting a picture in. It's actually quite simple, Use a needle to pop out the plastic covering, trace the covering over the picture you want to use, cut out the picture, put the picture in, put the covering in, tadah! Other people seemed to have issues with opening the locket, again, it's not hard at all, just insert your finger nails in the seam and pull apart. Asides from all that the locket is actually really nice looking. The only problem I seem to have is the silver seems to scratch easily. Other than that great product!
",4
10729,"The necklace is beautiful, but there are no directions/instructions about how to get a picture into the locket. Very frustrating! To make things worse, I contacted Amazon, and they could not tell me any additional information. I find it strange that they do not know simple information about a product they sell. The necklace is beautiful (4 stars), but since it does not do what it is supposed to, and because of Amazon's poor service, I would change my vote to 1 star.
",4
10742,"I just got my belly button pierced, and I am now wearing this ring. It is very comfortable in the piercing, and looks very pretty. The only thing is, that the top ball is a little hard to open at first.
",4
10745,"I have ended up wearing these earrings quite a lot. They are quite pretty, small, understated but with a little sparkle that catches the light now and then. They go well with my marcasite choker. A nice, versatile pair of earrings. I think they are overpriced however, despite their good quality.
",4
10749,"I gave this to my husband because it occurs to me that if medical professional need to know his allergies, he may not always be able to tell them and I may not be there to speak for him
",4
10751,"Ordered this necklace to replace the one I have worn for over 40 years that finally came apart. This one is exactly like the photograph shown with the item, on one side is a medic alert symbol using a raised piece of painted metal that is riveted to the base and on the other side is the stamped lettering for the penicillin allergy. I can't tell you how long it will last since I've only had for a week, but assuming the rivets used to mount the medic alert symbol hold, it should last me the rest of my life :)
",4
10777,"I received the chain I ordered and was surprised, as I don't think the picture above does it justice. Its very pretty and very shiny. And strong. Will definitely be put to very good use.
",4
10782,"The earrings were nice, they were good quality and looked good in my ears. I also liked that they weren't too big more my ears.
",4
10789,"Great product and quality. Very appreciated by the recipiet of the gift as something to organize body piercing jewelry. A+
",4
10794,"Find it truly need and handsome. The compartments are good enough for all standard sized cuff links (can hold 8 pairs). However, at the bottom of the box, i found a small golden sticker which says ""Made in China"", but I am paying US Dollars for such a small little box... Hmm, I guess the profit margins must be good for the merchant. Steven Lim (RSTN)
",4
10795,"The dealer did not have the ring I ordered, but they are very helpful and they did their best to satisfy my request.
",4
10885,"My mom absolutely loved it after she went and got her glasses and strained to read what it said. Otherwise, it's high-quality and beautiful.
",4
10887,"Received items well ahead of scheduled delivery window. Items were sensibly packaged and no damage was noted.Jewelry bags were of the right size I was looking for. Material was soft and thick, very thick from what I am used to, which is a plus as it cushions anything I place in these bags.I am a little turned off by the large ""Made in the PRC"" tag in each bag. Because of this I don't wish to purchase any more of this item. But this does not change the decent construction or quality of the product. Any issue related to the tag is at the discretion of the individual buyer.Update:I've been using these bags for several weeks now and have had one fail. The drawstring on one bag turned into several long threads and then broke completely. The bag itself is still good with no signs of even wear or tear. Have to rethread a cord through this one.
",4
10888,"I'm going to order larger bags...these are great for small earrings, but larger earrings and bracelets need the 5"" bags. they're well made and a bargin pricewise
",4
10891,"I ordered a few of these bracelets in different styles as gifts. Though I am not sure they are sterling, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price. It also comes in a nice box that is perfect for gift giving.
",4
10894,"Received this item in a timely manner and it is stamped .925 sterling silver. The size was just right and the outer band smoothly spins around the fixed band. As in the image, the outer band is silver and the underlying band is a dark background bringing out the pattern, however, in the image, the outer band of knots appears to be raised, whereas the one I received is flat. Also, my ring looks much more like a series of figure 8's ,overlapping in places, rather than actual knots with the over-under as appears in the image. Where the design begins and ends there is an obvious seam.That said, I wanted this as something I could wear to Ren Faire and the crude design lends itself to that rather than something overly fancy. And at the price, I wasn't expecting too much so am ok with the item I received.
",4
10895,"Good product, looks very pretty. I am very satisfied for the price I paid.
",4
10902,"The bracelet was exactly as shown in the picture. It comes in a lovely box with a card that has a poem written on it. My friends loved the bracelets and I am very pleased with the purchase!
",4
10905,"The bracelet looks good, the package is very nice. Great small gift for someone younger. Clasp is a little difficult for someone to work alone.
",4
10909,"Really like these bracelets, bought one for myself, then ordered four more for my sisters and Niece. I've gotten many compliments on how pretty they are. The message each conveys, will be a nice reminder to each giftee, that I'm thinking of them and wishing them well. The only thing is; avoid getting them wet, when washing your hands, the silver plate will come off, so be careful.
",4
10911,"This bracelet has very positive words and it is so lovely. I wish it was just more durable. The heart peace off within days of use. And i love it so much that i was actually taking care of it before that happened. Other than that though this is a great bracelet.
",4
10919,"I placed an order for 4 different types of these bracelets to give to co workers for valentines day, but I cancelled the orders after I read the reviews and most commented on the faulty clasps of the bracelets.I sent an email to DMM expressing my concerns about the clasps being faulty as when you're giving a gift to someone, its really not nice to give a faulty gift, and I must say they promptly responded to my concerns with:&#34; We've sold thousands of theses braclets with a very small number of complaints. This is the first i've ever heard of a faulty clasp. If something's wrong with a product you are almost guaranteed to hear from a customer, but if everything's good, you never get the good reviews, people just go about their day. So to judge an item based on a couple of reviews, defintely doesn't reflect the true quality of an item in most cases. We've already refunded your order, so you would have to re-order at this point.&#34;Although not totally convinced abt the faulty clasps, I will definitely reorder as they are just too cute and adorable and the price is right.
",4
10922,"It as a very nice bracelet. It was shorter than i expected but it was very pretty and the box was beautiful.
",4
10927,"Bought as a gift for my friend in UK! I love the quality & look of the bracelet and the poem too!But, the lovely gift box was mashed all up and torn during shipping!very disappointed in shipping quality but not bracelet.
",4
10935,"I have this one in two different color, the black and the light blue. Both are awesome. If you like dice, then you'll love this.
",4
10949,"Nothing remarkable. The white inner cloth does clean a bit better when damp (not wet) and the outer blue one shines things up nicely. It states not to use it with pearls or 14kt gold or higher as it will scratch. I don't know if it is just a disclaimer to protect themselves, but I'm not going to take the chance!
",4
10967,"I finally wore out another cloth I had been using. This is a large cloth - so I expect it will last me quite awhile. I use this cloth to keep the jewelry that is on display in my store bright and shiny. We are near the beach - so things can tarnish quickly. It is easy to use and doea a great job.
",4
10971,"Quick and easy way to clean jewelry but was a bit messy on the fingers. When I'm in a rush and want a quick clean this is the way to go.
",4
10973,"It's not a miracle cloth, but it does a very good job as long as you're willing to spend some time rubbing your jewelry.
",4
10988,"I bought this after reading the fave reviews from many others. Out of sheer curiosity, I decided to buy one to try. I managed to try it on my silvers just recently and found it to be effective. There are two layers to the cloth, the exterior being the blue one and the interior being the white. The white piece is the one that is treated with chemicals. The blue for polishing. The design of the cloth is good because of the arrangement of the cloths: it keeps your hands far less dirty than you would to use just the white cloth itself. You need only to gently rub the pieces to see the stains on the cloth. I think with technique, this cloth could do better. Very good value for money and definitely clever.
",4
11023,"I asked my husband to guy this for me since I had a ton of sterling silver jewelry that was tarnished and I never wore anymore. It is a great cloth, easy to use and took the tarnish off no problem. I even had a pair of earrings that were BLACK with tarnish. It does seem that it works differently on different items that are sterling though. Some of my pieces I cannot buff to as high a shine as others but this cloth helped me discover a whole lot of my jewelry that I thought I was not going to wear again.
",4
11025,"The product arrived quickly. It is large enough for me to clean even very large silver pieces. A pair of earrings that were badly tarnished, and unwearable - to my way of thinking, were sitting on my desk for the trial run and they are beautiful now - they look brand new. Tarnish residue was left on my fingers - but that's part of the process, last I checked.Unfortunately, it seems that some people received and instruction card with the cloth? This was not the case with my order, therefore, I gave it only four stars.
",4
11035,"Great price and worked perfectly. I polished my Pandora bracelet and it sparkles now, so happy with this purchase! Great size and you cant beat that price. Sent link of the product to several friends!
",4
11046,"I have some necklaces with various stones that I couldn't use liquid silver polish on. This worked great as I could work carefully around the stones and take my time without worrying about making a mess.
",4
11049,"I needed a polishing cloth to spruce up some of my silver jewelry that had seen better days. This cloth should last me a while - it is a great size and polished up my lovelies nicely.
",4
11065,"My career keeps me on stage. Because of this, I was forever searching for some attractive jewelry to wear during a show. Gem Avenue was my answer with this and many more inexpensive and attractive rings. Of all my past purchases, I would buy this one again and find myself wearing THIS more than my others. A little thin, but purely beautiful. Buy this ring.
",4
11069,"I ordered the ring, thinking that the quality would be low; however, I liked the design of the ring. When I opened the box, I was really surprised at the quality. I only wear it when going to nice places. I always get comments on how nice it looks. I am going to buy some of the other rings.
",4
11077,"i recieved this ring in the mail yesterday, it is a great product, but the color is a bit more pink than it appears on the computer. otherwise no complaints
",4
11094,"The receiver of this gift has had so many compliments on this item and I myself am most pleased with its quality and design. The only thing I would (and did) change about this item was to replace the thin box chain with a substantial ball chain. The box chain is too flimsy for the weight of the tag and it appears more authentic with the ball type chain.I would have rated it 5 stars if it were not for the chain! I am dis-appointed now though, because I reordered the item and the design changed!Now I can't get the same as I originally ordered!
",4
11095,"It's a nice ring I think. I am glad I added it to my jewelry and ring collection.
",4
11104,"The ring is beautiful, it looks as great in person as in the picture. If you buy it you will need to clean it often - it begins to dim with wear very quickly. and it is thin so if you buy it be ready for easy dents. Otherwise you will really enjoy the ring and will probably be happy with it.
",4
11113,"This is a beautiful alternative to the traditional claddagh ring. I love the Celtic knots instead of the hands holding the heart. It makes me more elegant. The ring had a slight deformation on part of the heart but it's not too noticeable. I wear it on an almost daily basis. :D
",4
11114,"fast delivery, lovely packaging, accurate sizing... I haven't taken the ring off since it arrived!!
",4
11117,"I love this ring and I wear it everyday. However, it did turn my finger green. After coating the inside of the ring with clear fingernail polish, I haven't had any problems with it.
",4
11119,"I'm not sure why some of the reviews called this ring ""large"". It is not. In fact, my daughter was replacing a claddagh ring and was a little dissappointed that it wasn't a little bigger, as described in some of the reviews. It's the size I'd have expected, and she likes it very much.
",4
11151,"I really loved the ring when I got it in. My ONLY complaint is that it is a tad bit smaller than I was thinking it would be. But it's still so pretty and I wear it everyday!
",4
11158,"I bought this ring to replace on an ex boyfriend got me. It was a good price and i think its really pretty.
",4
11163,"I love it. The box it came in was cute. The Claddagh ring is something I always wanted. I love this ring. It's very feminine.
",4
11174,"Hands on a ring weird me out, so this was great.I have some concerns about the .925 sterling silver,so we'll see if my daughter's finger turns green at any point.But for now, it was a great purchase and gift.
",4
11175,"It is smaller than pictured- but i love it! Showing off my Irish pride :)
",4
11180,"This claddagh ring has the celtic symbol instead of the hands folded hands, I prefer the hands. II gave my friend that was allergic 2 nickel this 1. She LIKED IT.
",4
11185,"Great ring for the price - my teenage stepdaughter loves it. I gave it a 4 because it was a bit more dainty than I thought it would be, and wouldn't want it for myself.
",4
11198,"I used this as an interim wedding ring while my real one was being made. It's exactly as pictured, very detailed and substantial. I wear it on my right hand now as it is so lovely and it's held up well.
",4
11213,"I purchased this ring for a gift for my daughter's birthday. The ring was nicer that the picture looked online. She was really pleased with the ring.
",4
11219,"Ring is almost exactly as pictured. The heart is not as full and rounded but that is a minor difference. I have not turned green so metal is silver. Overall a nice purchase.
",4
11246,"Like I mentioned in the feedback, this seller was in my same state and shipping was great (on time, condition, etc.) It was exactly what I was expecting and looking for.
",4
11256,"I love this ring and I think it's beautiful, but it took a while to get here. Over all, I'm happy with the product and the ring sizing charts provided on the site are very accurate. Enjoy! :)
",4
11259,"The style and design are great. It did however turn part of my finger green. Its a really mild green and is on the bottom of my finger, probably from my sweat. Id recommend this ring to people, unless its a gift. It might be embarrasing if you give as a gift and the recieptant's finger gets slight green markings.
",4
11268,"its very pretty but the only complaint i have is the heart is a little crooked. All in all it looks like the picture.
",4
11277,"I bought these as a gift, along with another pair from this seller. These were offered at an extremely low price and when they arrived, they were well worth what I paid. I would recommend these (and this seller)
",4
11300,"I was very happy with the product because it arrived looking just like the picture online. Also, it arrived in the time I needed it.
",4
11310,"I think that this is actually a very decent bracelet and for the price more than a great buy. This makes a very good gift.
",4
11321,"As I said in the title, this piece of jewelry is indeed truly lovely, and well made too - nothing flimsy or cheap looking about it. The crystal is a very nice size as well. This was a very satisfying online shopping experience in every aspect!
",4
11322,"I have to replace the chain because it's a little too small, but the stone is absolutely gorgeous! It's a christmas gift for my sister and I know she will adore it. Thank you!
",4
11336,"I got this toe ring and just love wearing it. Its pretty sturdy but is slightly different from the image shown. in the middle portion its more of silver but image shows a white tinge.The only problem is that they are too narrow that they fit only super thin toes though they are adjustable.
",4
11346,"I bought this ring in an 11 to fit my right thumb. Other reviews said buy it one size up, so I did. Fits nicely and is very attractive. Lots of compliments on ring. Wear it on days when not too busy with hands as it does catch on things occasionally but no more than any other ring might. Not cumbersome, even though substantial. I am allergic to metals accept gold and silver and have no problem with green on my flesh, so even though ring is not stamped, I believe it is sterling. This is definitely a good buy, you will enjoy this piece in your collection.
",4
11354,"I saw this product on-line and purchased it. It looks the same on-line as it does in person and I have gotten much use out of it already. I have also gotten compliments on it. It goes with anything and is fun and unique to wear. I can tell where it was cut and melted back together though when I chose my ring size (which is fairly small) but I don't think it is that noticeable to anyone else as I wear that part to show on the under side of my finger. I plan to continue to get lots of use out of it and the only thing I would recommend is to take off the ring before applying lotion - it does get stuck in the wiring otherwise and makes it hard to get out!
",4
11361,"It is a beautiful ring. I ordered a size 7 and it is a tight fit because of the design. I suggest going a size larger when ordering.
",4
11362,"My teenage daughter chose this ring as an inexpensive gift for a friend's birthday. The item was as expected and accurately represented. The item was shipped promptly and arrived with time to spare for the birthday party. Birthday girl loved the gift, as well.
",4
11364,"I love this ring because it is so unique and people always have good comments to give me about it. My only complaint is that the ring is hard to keep clean. It will get tarnished (as all silver does) in the nooks and crannies which can be a pain. But I love this ring despite that!
",4
11366,"I really liked this ring.Very cool, and very different from anything I ever wear.Unfortunately, I didn't see the cautions about size until it was too late. It was a full size too small. And it wouldn't fit on any other finger. Well, that's not true, it fit nicely on my step-daughter's finger.If you like the ring, order a size larger than what you think you need.Then, you'll be happy.
",4
11370,"The ring is very lovely. Not quite the way it is pictured, but still very nice to look at and well-sized. But be careful and examine yours when you get it. Mine has a section that digs into my finger if I wear it ""wrong,"" so I don't wear it that often.
",4
11372,"The ring is good but the size is a bit smaller than other size 8 rings i've had in the past
",4
11373,"I wanted a ring that stood out yet was not too flashy. This is perfect. The unusual shape makes it an eye catching item, yet its neither bulky nor overwhelming. I love it. Two caution.... it doesn't exactly look like the picture. I just happen to really like anyways. Second it often gets caught in my hair or clothing. so watch out.I would recommend it and would buy it again.
",4
11375,"It looks as amazing on the website as well as on the finger. The size is exact. The Sterling silver is nicely done with a hint of shine. It is a talk piece whenever I wear it. Its intricate detail of the wirework is so well done. Though from time to time I feel the wire slightly jab the underskin of my finger, but can be fixed by turning the ring so it is more comfortable. I've had no discoloration so far and I wear this ring all the time. It is a piece that you will not be disappointed with. Great price to top it all. Enjoy!!
",4
11379,"Love the ring! It's certainly unique, and many people have complimented on it. For the sizing of the ring, I used Amazon's ring guide and it fits perfectly. It does on occasion snag my clothes, so I have to be careful when I wear it. Overall, I'm very pleased with it!
",4
11381,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this ring. I wasn't expecting much but it's quite sturdy. It's a conversation piece and when a friend of mine saw it, she immediately ordered one for herself. Since they are all originals, you have to expect some imperfections but it truly is a beautiful ring. GREAT price!!
",4
11402,"It looks exactly like the picture. The ring looks delicate but feels sturdy and is very unique but do be aware that it can easily snag on clothes. If you're unsure about the size, I'd suggest order a larger size because there's no flexibility in the ring. It's fairly comfortable but wide so be sure you really like it before buying. I'm very happy with it!
",4
11403,"I like it alot, but not for everyday wear, the silver is soft and will bend if caught on something, but for the price, nice addition to jewelry collection.
",4
11409,"Ring fit perfectly, open work is interesting and attracts attention. The loops DO catch on my backback everytime I take the backpack off, and so have already broken one soldered connection.
",4
11416,"Everyone at work loves the ring and my customers ask where I got it all the time... it's unusual and fun!
",4
11417,"This is a beautiful ring but the sizes run small. I would have needed a size 11 or 12 to fit my ring finger but they don't go that big. I had to exchange this item and it was really easy. The order also arrived quickly in appropiate packaging.
",4
11418,"I just recieved my order. This ring is true to size. It is comfortable for a wide ring and is very delicate looking. I know that I will enjoy this ring for a long time.
",4
11426,"Girlfriend liked it. Her friends liked it even more. Can't really see the diamonds too well, but they at least give a nice glimmer. I payed $119.00 for it in August 2007.
",4
11427,"I bought this necklace a couple of years ago. I paid less than the price shown, but would gladly have paid more. It is one of my favorite necklaces ever and I wear it all the time. There is quite a bit of gold in the necklace. You won't be disappointed if you like butterflies or if you like staion neclaces.
",4
11428,"I've had this for a while and always get compliments on how cute and original. I did put it on too tight and my toe went blue, but now i put it on as ment. I love this toe ring.
",4
11431,"I was looking for some unique but simple earrings for quite a while when I saw these on amazon. After reading other reviews I was a bit worried about the ease of getting them on and off. I am pleased to say that after the first couple of times of wearing them I got the hang of it, it is very simple now. I really love them and wear them all the time.
",4
11432,"I like these earrings because they are unique and comfortable. The only problem I had was getting them in and out. It's a little tricky with the swirls and the whirls took a little coordination. But still like them.
",4
11438,"product is very unique. easy to put on and take off. on the small side though. it could be a little longer.
",4
11440,"They are a bit hard to get in but I like them. Very nice and different. People comment on them because they are different.
",4
11443,"The design and the fluid movement of this beautifully made earring really catches one's eye.Choose your desired metal and you're ready to go.I didn't give it 5 stars as they were a bit petite in size and weight.Thank You Mr. Mason.
",4
11468,"I really like this little ring. Unfortunately, they didn't have it in the size I needed and I bought a bigger size that doesn't quite fit. I like the blue stone and styling...would recommend to everyone!
",4
11471,"Seems strange that i'm twenty-three years over the age asked. The ring my wife loves. Now I feel silly the i bought my wife a ring that some fourteen year old would buy for a elementary school dance. Oh well.Patrick
",4
11482,"Ring arrived on time and looked like it's picture. Just be aware of the return policy. Only 10 days to get a refund and a 35% restocking fee. Combined with FedEx costs to Canada, it's almost not worth sending back for an exchange or refund.Again, the ring arrived on time and as presented, so overall they do a good job. Would just like to see a more relaxed online return policy for a $70 ring.
",4
11488,"The Salton jewelry cleaner makes your jewelry look brand new. I could not believe the dirt that is removed from all the pieces. I found it is best to repeat the process to get the best results. Once done your jewelry will sparkle. The only problem was setting it up the first time. You must make sure the water container is securely in its place or the steam will not function even though the ready light is on. Highly recommend this product.
",4
11500,"They are beautiful earings. The only thing was the picture made me think the coral was red when it's actually more orange than red. Maybe the description could say more about the color of the stones since sometimes the color in the pictures can be a little off.
",4
11502,"The price was right! They are a little flimsy but it meets our needs. I will order them again when needed.
",4
11513,"So I bought these for my husband and he now wears one when he's doing work around the house, which is pretty hilarious. They are exactly how they look, pretty small, perfect for a guy or a girl, just covering the earlobe. Nice earrings, if the back is too long just take a wire cutter to them.
",4
11517,"These are really cute little earrings. However, they are so tiny, it just looks like little squiggles in my ears. I have to hold them right up to my eye to see that they are actually snakes. The workmanship is nice and the product description is accurate.
",4
11524,"I've gone through 2 pairs... And I LOVE them BUT... they pop off every time I pull my hair one way or the other, they're fantastic..if you can keep your hair or clothes from ripping them out and losing them...
",4
11525,"These are cute. Were a gift to sister- by request. They really are ""tiny"", I think they're best for young girls/girls, or second hole for women.
",4
11531,"These are small silver lightning bolts, exactly as pictured, about the size of your earlobe. They're fun and cute. Nice earrings, if the back is too long just take a wire cutter to them.
",4
11533,"the bolt shapes are the same as the picturebut it is pretty thinner than what you see.all in all, pretty satisfied!
",4
11546,"I have this for a year. It still looks nice. It gets dirty pretty easily, but just invest in some cleaner. It looks real and it very cute. I'm happy with it!
",4
11553,"Earrings look good, very sparkly. Wish they had lever backs instead of french wires. Otherwise they are perfect! Can be worn dressy or casual.
",4
11589,"my mom loves it but the chain is too short. So now I have to take her to jewlery store to find the right size chain.
",4
11613,"I like these earrings. They're light-weight and I get a lot of compliments on them. They're a little more stiff than I thought they would be from the picture, but other than that, they're just what I expected. Thanks!
",4
11632,"Only problem is all the branding on all the stuff. It would be much nicer if finejewelers wasn't on the bag, box, and then on the inside of the jewlry box.

11656,"I really liked the pearl necklace, it's nice and affordable. If you're looking for the finest pearls or are a pearl expert, well, I'd advise you to seek a specialized jewelry store but if you're just browsing for a nice affordable gift, this is the right place. I like the necklace and earrings and the look pretty well on my girlfriend. Thanks!.

11670,"It is a nice piece of jewlery. Pearls are not too big but not too small either. The clasp is a bit tricky and feels quite flimsy. My girl friend loves it and has gotten many compliments but she can't wear without someone's help. Over all great for the price.

11671,"For the price, I got what I paid for. VERY heavy odd shaped pearls but once on the neck the look great with heft !!!!! These make a great gift !!

11690,"These pearls were beautiful, I purchased them for my bridesmaids to wear at my wedding with their rust-colored dresses and they were absolutley beautiful. The pearls were slightly flawed and uneven but nothing very noticable. They had a great luster and looked very natural. The biggest problem was I ordered 3 and couldn't get a 4th. Disappointing! Other then that they were a great purchase, I was impressed.
",4
11691,"Buying jewelry online is a hit or miss, and I wasn't expecting much at the great price during a gold box promo. Also, I tend to be on the pickier side.When I first got this, at first touch it felt nice and cool in the hand as all pearls does and should; the weight was very substantial, and the earrings, a little flatter than round was well made.However, boy did I STRUGGLE with the clasp! And usually I have no issues with fishhook clasp. I literally played with it for at least 30mins, as I was trying hard not to put any strain on the delicate strand. However, once I figured it out, it's pretty easy now and I can easily get it on and off.The pearls themself has a nice sheen to them, is a creamy white color and is pretty uniform in size. However, there are blemishes, but I like that as it makes it more unique. (I also have a few other strands, one being from over seas given as a gift from a soldier when he was there that was very costly, but unfortunately, the strand broke and I've been procrastinating to get them restrung.) The blemishes are 'natural' looking and not the fake plastic looking flaws some pearls have, and at a distant, you can't really see they're baroque.I'm only 5' barely weighing in the triple digits and am 27 years old, so these are pretty big on me, but I like unique big bold jewelry, and this definitely screams that, and that's not really something someone says about pearls! So I'm very pleased. The 17"" is very nice! I love the length! It's just perfect! Since the pearls are so big in size and heavy in weight, 16"" would given me that 'suffocating' feeling which I can't stand for more than say an hour, and 18"" would be wayyyyy to big for this type of jewelry on me. So this sits perfectly on my neckline. However, my mother, who is 62 and a bit on the heavier side, did not appreciate the length at all. So be weary with that. That being said, it looks great with all types of shirts such as boat, crew neck, v-neck etc. Also, the color and sheen to it looks wonderful with any color combination! These can be dressed up or worn casually. I can pull this off with jeans and a nice shirt, but would have no problems wearing this with a dressier outfit. (However, usually when I'm really dressed up, I tend to go for diamonds...but that's just me =)The earrings are very BIG! So big that when I wear them, I have to take out my second piercing, otherwise both earrings would be smushed together. Then again, pearls look classier by themself, then with all my earrings in my ears. (I have a total of 7 ear piercings, 4 on my left, and 3 on my right, and 3 of them are cartiledge piercings.) Like I said above, the pearls on the earrings are 'flatter' but that's also a good thing as it doesnt sit too high up on your ears, but just perfect since it doesnt get in the way or feel uncomfy. These earrings are also well made; no glue or nothing to be seen!All in all, these were a real bargain for the price! I would have been happy with just the necklace, so I view the earrings as an added bonus. I would NOT be surprised if I saw just the earrings alone for the price I paid, as this set is realy well made.I am very happy with this item and will definitely recommend! However, I wouldn't purchase this for anyone I know...just because I like to be the only one with pearls this big and awesome looking! lol j/k...kind of.ETA: If these ever go back down to the sale price I bought it for, I am DEFINITELY going to pick up at least another set or two, just in case something happens to this one. I wore it earlier with a black cowl neck shirt, and the pearls looked dazzling and just the perfect length!
",4
11694,"Lovely jewelry, great price, but the clasp is pretty tough to work. This is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers. I'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. It's probably a great choice for very occassional use, though with the quality and price, it really is a regular-use type of necklace. I think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered, traditional-fashion person.

11710,"I bought these for my wife on Valentines day. Sadly she was in the hospital for a surgery and came back home on Valentine's day, and when I gave her this gift - her smile made my day.She was floored by the pearl string - flat out. The weight and feel of the real odd shaped pearls is really flattering on a womans neckline. The ""potato"" oddness of the imperfect round shape adds more authenticity to the individual pearls.A very good buy for the value.At least for me, who never can tell a perl from a similarly glistening worthless stone, this string of pearls and the ear buds made my wife wonder how could I have selected such a nice choice...

11742,"I realize the item only costs $20. This is why I gave it 4 stars. If I had paid more the rating would be lower. The dolphin is very light and open on the back. The chain is cheap and the stone has very little color. I think the stone was the biggest disappointment because I planned to replace the chain. The dolphin itself has a cute shape. I wish I had seen a picture of the back before buying. I've decided to keep it mainly due to time constraints and I will put a new chain on it. However, I wouldn't order again. I would probably pay more and get a heavier, nicer necklace. But, at $20 my niece can consider it disposable.

The box was very cheap, the sides are &#34;bent&#34; in almost dented but not damaged. Not great considering it's a gift and I know my niece won't even notice. Overall I'm pleased and look forward to giving her these cute earrings for Christmas 2012!

11769,"My little girl loved them and they are delicate enough to keep in for long periods. They only got 4 stars because one of the posts was badly bent and it was difficult to get it back to a reasonable shape without jewelers pliers. other than that they were just the ticket.

I looked around at Macy's and a few other quality places and found similar items for as low as $250 on sale during the holidays. They were not identical, and I do like these a bit better.I do wish they were a little larger, but my wife thinks they are perfect. No regrets,and she loves them. I'm happy. No rip off's or junk. Glad I got em for her.

11842,"I was surprised by the color of this necklace when I got it. Instead of the moonstone-looking color it has a light purple color to it. The stone itself has lines across it that is typical of blue lace agate. I love how unusual the silver around it is too. This pendant comes with the necklace included. It is light enough in weight to be worn comfortably all day. Blue lace agate is useful in spiritual work by helping to protect you, improve optimism, positive thinking, hope, patience, and peace just to name a few. This is a great necklace but don't judge the stone color based on the picture.

11858,"Pearls are notoriously difficult to buy and sell via the web because a pearl's color varies so much, and it's tough to accurately portray color on a screen. This is especially true of black pearls, which can be black, blue, gray, purple, or green.I've tried 4 Augustina black pearl necklaces, and all leaned toward the blue/gray spectrum, with splashes of purple and pink and very little green, my least favorite color. These pearls have a nice shape and luster. The 3-strand necklaces, however, weren't properly graduated; the middle strand lays on the top of the bottom strand more often than not instead of ""nesting"" in the middle. If you like your multi-strand necklaces to lay flat, you may not like that; if you don't mind them jumbled, it may not bother you. Beautiful necklace for the price, just disappointed with the way the strands were graduated.
",4
11859,"This is a beautiful bracelet. It has a nice weight to it, enough to know if it falls off (which it hasn't yet).The bracelet is flat which is perfect. It allows for a nice number of charms; however, I have been wearing it with one charm at a time, simply because I like the way it looks and feels.
",4
11860,"Earrings seems sturdy and nicely made. Leverback posts secure in place easily and no worries such as those with traditional french hooks. The tiny clear crystals are cute, but do not expect to be very visible at a distance. The cuts/facets on the blue crystal cubes are extremely pretty- but again, can only be appreciated up close. I have long, dark hair so must wear it up to show off these little beauties.

11863,"Delivery was quick .. one point I would like to mentioned is, I saw a nice purple color on the amazon but after the delivery of the actual product, the color was more light which was first kind of disappointed me .. but it had good lusture and nice uniform shaped.

12083,"THIS belly button ring, is SO adorable. It is true to the picture and is very high quality. I have gotten so many compliments on how cute, sexy, and unique it looks clinging to my navel. Now, this is to be expected with any out-of-the-ordinary belly rings such as the IZZY LIZZY, BUT I do not find it to be very comfortable when sitting down while wearing it. The lizard is so long that it pushes against the bottom of my navel and causes the same pain I felt when I left the piercing parlour. To fix this, I just adjust the way I sit. Other than that, no issues whatsoever.I only wear this when I KNOW my belly will be exposed, i.e. beach day, pool party, hot date (&lt;- lol, just kidding), and any other time to show off the stomach. But at the end of the day I put a bioplast back in for comfort purposes.All in all, very cute. Very attention getting. A tad uncomfy in certain positions, and in my opinion, NOT to be worn for extended periods of time.Happy Shopping!-Jewel.

I do however think that if your going to spend the money on diamond earings, you should get the best. Never settle. 1 carat is the perfect size for diamond earings. I found a different pair that I plan on buying that are even more beautiful than the ones i already bought. They are brilliantly cut round 1 carat diamonds that can't be matched.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093F4K7M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0093F4K7M&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazon070f-20

12154,"My dad gave me these earrings as a present when I got into college, & I absolutely loved them. As a jewelry maker I'm extremely picky, but I only found a couple small issues with them. The backings are a little loose so they sometimes feel like they're going to fall out. Also, the sapphires are a little too opaque. At the same time, both of these problems might just be with my pair in particular. They're actually bigger than they seem & look pretty big once you put them on. All in all, a great gift at a good price. I think most women would be very happy with them, I am!

12441,"These earrings are quite well made. The posts are solid and there are no gaps or spurs where the post joins the ball. However, there are 2 drawbacks for me personally.My earlobes are rather thick so the posts ended up being a bit shorter than I prefer. This surprised me as the other reviewer for these stated that the posts were ""long"". Maybe my ears are abnormally thick, but I've not encountered earrings with posts this short before *shrug*. Putting them on was a little bit of a struggle, but in the end I was able to wear them all day without feeling pinched. However, when I went to take them off at the end of the day it was a bit of a challenge. Of course having extremely short nails probably doesn't help me at all either.My other issue is the size of the backs. They are miniscule! Fortunately I had purchased a bag of backs a while back so I just traded them out and all was right with the world.These earrings do look really nice and so far seem to be of a good quality. Even though I have to struggle a bit with them I will continue to wear and enjoy them because once they are on, I am good to go without any complaints.

12486,"I bought the earrings to wear for looks, since I don't want to get my ears re-pierced. They look great but are very strong magnets. Can usually only wear for couple of hours and my ear lobes hurt. But for the most part they serve the purpose for an evening out. Just not for all day wear. I havent noticed them cutting down on my appetite ect, and have worn them as recommended for 1 hour or more prior to eating. Also found they look great on blouses that I do not want to put pin marks on, I use all four and make a cluster of the pearl and gold tone earrings.

12573,"So this is my first cuff earring (I've been dying to get one so I'm pretty excited), and I don't know if it's just because I'm still learning how to wear it (hard to get on when the gap is smaller but tends to slide down a little on my ear when the gap is bigger) but I am having some minor issues. Even so, I love that it was so cheap and because the metal bends easily so I can adjust it. I think it's very pretty, and once it's on, it's very comfortable, and I completely forget it's there.

12578,"The diameter of it is a bit larger than I expected however it is a very nice piece and I love wearing it.

12585,"I received this bracelet today and am very pleased. It is sturdy enough while also being very soft and feminine looking. I agree with a previous reviewer that it probably will not hold more than a few regular size charms so I'm thinking of buying a selection of miniature seashell charms to complete the bracelet. The bracelet's links are tiny(4mm or just slightly more than 1/8th inch across) which is smaller than I originally assumed from the photo.For those wanting to add a collection of charms I would caution that the design is sturdy, but not super heavy-duty. It's a great weight for a light, summer look!

12590,"These earrings are pretty good. Pretty much what I expected. This is the second time I have purchased them.

12591,"Nothing fancy, but exactly as depicted. Pleased with purchase and price.
",4
12604,"I love this ring and looked at it a thousand times before I ended up buying it. It arrived in great shape and was everything I expected. I have had no issues with Eve's Addiction and would definitely shop with them again. However, there is one little problem...the rose gold band started to turn almost immediately. It looks almost antiqued, sort of pink but mostly black down around all the prongs. The coating just didn't hold up. I like the ring and still wear it often, I just wish it hadn't tarnished so quickly. The other two bands still look like they did the day the ring arrived.

12607,"I was please with the detail, size and weight of the charm. Three dimentional.

12649,"My mom loved this. I have had a great time with this vendor. Everything they make is well done and arrives very quickly without any problems. I really like that they have pendants of many specific dog breeds. My mom is a dedicated Papillon owner; so, this was a great gift.
",4
12676,"Beautiful pair of earings. Packing was good, and the quality also seems to be nice. It sure does sparkle. Exactly what I wanted for everyday use. I think its worth the price.
",4
12693,"The ring came in a timely manner. It is very comparable to rings found in retail stores. I only wish it had come in more sizes. I had to go get the ring sized up and that took about two weeks but now I wear it every day. :)
",4
12727,"I purchased this for my mother who loves rollerskating and she really likes this too, but it is a bit small; the size listed is accurate, so don't be frightened off, just don't expect people to know what this is from a distance.
",4
12731,"I was looking for something to hold my dog's ashes in and this was way too small (5""w x4""d x 1 1/2""d) . I only have myself to blame for that as the measurements were listed. It is a handmade item so my heart box was shaped a bit wider than the one pictured. The felt inside is brown and a bit simple, but otherwise I could imaging it being a sweet gift for a loved one. A bit pricey, but special also as it is signed and dated.
",4
12737,"I bought these earrings for my 2-years old daughter. They perfectly fit a young girl and very secure. The look very realistic and natural and resemble a real ladybug sitting on the girl's ear. Someone mught thing they are tiny but it is a size of the ladybug, so don't expect a butterfly size. They look very beautiful especially on sunshine. I like it very much. So does my girl.

12739,"These studs are low-cost and really cute. I get compliments on them all the time at school and work. They were well-worth the purchase.
",4
12746,"These lovely earring really are comfortable and stylish. Silverspeck.com was very reliable with quick delivery and the earrings look great. I would recommend them to everyone who likes leverback earrings.
",4
12747,"These earrings are a beautiful shade of blue. I wear a lot of blue and they go with many different shades of blue.
",4
12762,"I under-estimated the size of these earrings. I was looking for very small hoops so I returned them. The company was great about the return. I would buy from them again.
",4
12775,"There is an inconsistency between the pair of earrings I received. The cutting of the stone is different on the top of each stone, resulting in one with more sparkle. Not many people would notice, but I will overlook that a little bit because otherwise, these have a good color. I got what I paid for.
",4
12788,"I was looking for some purple amethyst earrings to celebrate a special event and came across these economical little guys. The quality is good and shipping was timely. Really hard to beat at the price too. Only thing keeping these from being five-star is that the color was not as shown, they're actually quite pink.
",4
12793,"Beautiful earrings for a great price. It is a very good size and they can be wear with any occasions.
",4
12795,"its a very nice ring, with a great meaning. it's like a promise ring for your girlfriend/fiance/wife... i just hope it fits my girlfriend because it only comes in size 6.
",4
12797,"These are really pretty - but I was a little disappointed because they aren't as ""red"" as I'd hoped. They are more of a dark pink color - and I can't wear them with anything red. The stone really is beautiful though!
",4
12799,"I think these earrings were at a pretty nice for how much they were at. Though I didn't buy them for myself. But either way they looked really nice.
",4
12801,"These earrings look much better in person than in the picture. They are a deep pink color, which i was looking for, and i am absolutely in love with the square cut of them! They definitely look pricer than most CZ earrings.The only negative thing i have to say is that the earring backs are very very tiny, and could be easily dropped/lost--so watch out!
",4
12818,"Recently purchased an ultrasonic cleaner at Wal-mart, but was so displeased with it i took it back the next morning. Searched and found this one for just about the same price, but the difference is night and day. Am very pleased with this product, and would recommend and buy again.
",4
12822,"I use the cleaner to clean 9mm brass for reloading. It takes several cycles for cleaning, could be more powerful. You'll need to make a wire handle to remove the basket. I did this with some fine stainless steel wire.
",4
12830,"I say that this transaction wasn't what I expected because it came so quickly! But also because its quite bigger than I expected and in my opinion it a bit masculine for me. I didn't realize the design was alternating orientations either, and I was looking forward to utilizing the ring orientation in the traditional way which I now can't do. Also, I had another worry ring which I was replacing with this one that spun much better than this one does, probably because its 'bulky.' Of course, this is just my opinion! =] The service and quality is great and quick!
",4
12838,"I first ordered a size 10, which was correct for my thumb according to the ring size charts available on Amazon. It was WAY too large. I then ordered a size 9 and it was still too large. I would recommend at least 2 full sizes lower than Amazon suggests.Otherwise, the ring is not ""fine jewelry"", but it has a fun, comfortable shape and is a little more interesting than a plain band. The quality is good, but silver is soft and so it bends easily. I would buy it again (in the right size).
",4
12839,"I do like this thumb ring. I have never worn one before, but wearing it, I barely notice it's there. I like how it's curved for the shape of the thumb too. Great buy!
",4
12841,"The box looks nicer than it does in the picture, the only problem I had with it is that it's smaller than I thought it was going to be.
",4
12844,"So far so good. I still have a couple of pieces of jewerly that I would like to be sharper but guess I might have to take them in for professional cleaning. I tried cleaning one necklace numerous times, without the results I wanted. Good for at home use.
",4
12849,"I am satisfide with the produck and love the way it works its eazy and simpul to use....So thank u for your conser andHelp with my perches.
",4
12856,"Before filling, follow my jeweler's advice and add Mr. Clean up to the bottom of the basket and fill the rest of the way with water. He suggested that I toss my rings in every morning to clean them while I shower. No rub, no scrub (and no soap scum build-up)!
",4
12863,"I bought this to clean my dad's dentures. He couldn't clean them for himself anymore and I had frozen shoulder so it was a problem for me to do them by hand for him. This worked fine. Occasionally I had to run it more than once - the preprogrammed cycle was rather short for any real cleaning project - but it got them sparkly clean. I also used it to clean his very grungy watchband. Worked ok for that as well.
",4
12870,"her thoughts""I love it. It got both my jewelery and my watch very clean.""only negative, it jostled loose a couple of small diamonds, so make certain to look over all items that you put in to clean.
",4
12876,"I bought this for $45, and I think I should have bought the cheaper one. I read the reviews for both, and I think this performed just as well as the reviews for the cheaper model said these things do.Results:Citizen EcoDrive: 5 years old, Stainless Steel and gold tones, WR 100. I used the watch holder that came with the unit, and found that it cleaned the parts that were under water pretty well. Then I became adventurous and put the whole thing under water. So far, I don't think it hurt my watch, and it looks pretty shiny after wiping off the water.Dirty pennies: Didn't work out so well. It was neat to see the initial puff of dirt that rose to the surface of the water, but I didn't see shiny, new pennies afterward. Perhaps water couldn't remove the ravages of chemical reactions and old age.Antique watch band: This was a 1920s or 1940s ladies watch that I bought at a flea market. Bulova, 10-12K gold filled. I took the watch mechanics out and placed the bracelet and glass face in the water. The waves were so strong that they shook the glass face out of the bracelet. That was upsetting.Fossil Sunglasses: Someone left a pair of sunglasses at my house, so I cleaned them. They look clean. This seems better than wiping them since you could just be moving the dirt around and not removing it.That's all I've cleaned so far. So basically, it works pretty well on younger pieces with loose dirt. The older and more compact the dirt becomes, the harder it is to remove (which is understandable).
",4
12878,"I decided to purchase this item despite the negative reviews. I was a bit apprehensive because the price was about $10-$15 higher than others I found.I wear 8 diamond earrings in my ears and rarely take them out so they get really, really, REALLY gunked up with hairspray, etc. Normally I use one of those jewelry cleaners that the jeweler gives you, and even after soaking for an hour, I still have to scrub to get them clean and it still doesn't do a thorough job.I used this unit with Blitz Gem & Jewelry Cleaner ConcentrateGem & Jewelry Cleaner Concentrate (8 Oz)and even though I only used the 480 second setting just once, ALL the gunk was gone! I haven't seen my earrings this shiny/sparkly since I purchased them.I was a little nervous to use on my Tanzanite rings and bracelets since I've heard that the stone is a bit brittle, but had NO issues...Just used less time to clean and they still came out great!Also used on a pair of glasses that my boyfriend wears daily working as an electrician, and it worked well on those as well.The unit was much better made than expected after reading the reviews. I'm very pleased with the purchase and recommend it! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I wish they had a basket with smaller holes for stud earrings. If you put the studs in the very center they're ok, but if they shift out of the very center they will ""escape"" out the larger holes and can get lost if you don't pay attention. Providing a smaller basket for stud earrings and smaller pieces would be a great idea.
",4
12885,"I gave this necklace to my mother as part of her Christmas and she loved it. She thought I paid a lot more than I actually did. If you're looking to impress but not go broke doing it, this works pretty well. I gave it four instead of five because the CZs could be more shiny.
",4
12887,"It is a very distinctive and unique tie slide but it was thinner than I expected. My husband loves it.
",4
12901,"I've been looking for a Titanium ring like this for months and the cheapest price I found was over $100. Once I saw the price on it i figured what could I lose. But, this was the same product asa the others I'd seen and for a lot less. The process was quick and easy as well was the delivery. This is the reason I shop online......... oh and by the way the design should read ""Tribal Phoenix""
",4
12902,"I bought this ring last year as a gift for my best friend. The company has astoundingly quick delivery so kudos to them for it. Unfortunately they didn't have his size then (10) so I had to buy size 11. It was big for the finger I intended him to wear it on, but he switches it around or puts it on his chain.The design unfortunately scratches easily, so he takes it off when he's doing rough work such as moving chairs and tables. This is a ring that is probably great for light-active days/events.
",4
12913,"I can't really rate this except from the day my son got it. Fit well and looked nice, especially for the price. My son went back to Iraq, for the 8th time, the day after I gave it to him, he liked it a lot when I gave it to him.
",4
12918,"Its much darker than in the pictures but I dont mind. Very light and beautiful. Its titanium (a big plus) which doesnt give me a rash so big plus for that!
",4
12929,"I have smashed the blazes out of my wedding ring several times so I decided to get an ""everyday"" replacement. This was a wise choice because I think a truck could over my hand and it would be just fine. The ring feels heavy for its size. The only fault I have with it is that if you rub your face, this ring will scratch it. The outer edge is sharp. I'm sure it will dull over time but I find myself being a bit cautious with it. But for the price, it has been a great substitute.
",4
12930,"I looks a little biger in the amazon pictures, therefore I was specticting a thiker ring. But my future wife loves it, that's all that matters to me.The quality is high!
",4
12940,"Gift item that was much appreciated. Will have to have it sized for the ankle, but otherwise it was great.
",4
12951,"Extremely small, I think the measurement what is given is off. Small and very thin. It looks nice if you don't mind to have a very small earring on.
",4
12955,"I just received these earrings . They are just like the picture. They are smaller than what I imagined but I am still pleased. They are very light and you don't even know you are wearing them. I like the clasping mechanism on them and feel secure that they won't come undone. Great price. Received really quick even in the midst of xmas!! I would definately recommend them for someone who wants subtle gold earring.
",4
12956,"The quality seems to be high; and the filigree pattern is very attractive. Whlle they do seem a bit small, they look very good on my wife who received them as a gift. She was very pleased with their look and quality.
",4
12958,"The texture on these earrings gives them a beautiful sparkle. The clasp seems very sturdy, which is something I always look for. Overall, they seem to be a well made pair of earrings at a reasonable price.

12959,"These are small in size but overall a great value. Italian gold, great gift for the woman in your life.
",4
12961,"These earrings are subtle and dainty yet I I am complimented everytime I wear them. They are very light and so easy to wear that I have accidentally slept in them (without my noticing nor the earrings falling out over night).The locking mechanism at the back closes with a bit of a tug, which made me worry that I would bend the earrings, but I have not noticed any damage despite my fears.All in all, great earrings for the price.
",4
12967,"These Earrings are great. The only critisim I have was they were smaller than I expected from viewing their picture.
",4
12976,"...and she said ""yes""! ;)A beautiful ring and the stone sparkles like crazy. Also, it's very comforting to know where the stone came from...
",4
12988,"I bought this because I have a lot of silver jewelry that I wear. It does the job quite well, but on my dirtiest items, I found myself wishing I had a small toothbrush or some similar tool in order to get into the nooks & crannies without causing damage to the item itself.It takes a lot of effort to clean jewelry this way, but compared to other options, this is the safest & least damaging (in my opinion). If you don't have the time to sit down for a few hours & polish your jewelry, don't get this. Opt for something else.

It is represented here exactly as it really looks, which is very refreshing!!My only concern, which I will be contacting the company about, is that it did not come with a letter of authenticity.If one is not forthcoming, I will take my ring to my jeweler's to ensure both stones are authentic.
",4
13018,"I bought this for my 14 year old sister and she loved it. She loves giraffes and this was the only giraffe necklace on Amazon she liked and approved of (yes, even though it was a gift she chose it!). It is a nice height and doesn't look cheap. However, it does not come with a chain, which is a minor detail. Yet, since I assumed it did I had to find a chain for it.
",4
13020,"Genuine beauty garnet. The earrings are small, but noticeable and the color reflects very well. I purchased a matching pear shaped garnet pendant and the earring and pendant set is beautiful! The seller delivered the package in a timely manner. I would buy from this seller again.

13069,"Negatives:They are somewhat the large side if your main squeeze (or you) prefer small earrings.Positives:Sterling silver. Quality made. Great price. Good looking jewlery.Recommend it?Yes. The tree of life is spread throughout many cultures and can be adapted to your own philosophy or religion(it doesn't have to be just a ""Celtic"" thing). My wife loves these earrings and wears them often.
",4
13074,"I've owned this ring for about 7 yrs. I wear it on a daily basis. Some of the finish has worn off to reveal the silver underneath, but that is ok. I wear it with my platinum and diamond art deco wedding ring. It is a fantastic match. It is very thin in size so it looks best with another ring along side. No one ever questions that it is not real or vintage. Would purchase again if I ever lost the original.
",4
13081,"These little earring jackets work perfectly with my vintage diamond stud earrings. Although small, they are very nicely crafted,and the little diamonds add plenty of sparkle.The packaging was elegant, and the shipping was prompt, as promised. I appreciated the free shipping to Hawaii, very few firms are willing to do this. Would definitely buy from Katarina again.

13158,"My wife was wearing this for almost a year and the chain broke. Chain was a little weak. Other than that the pendant looked great.
",4
13159,"I got this on a Friday deal at Amazon for 200$. It was a great deal only at that price, because they were color H and I1 clarity. I have not had it upraised, but from my experience at the jewelers where I have seen I1-I3 ranges, the description at Amazon is pretty accurate. At a greater price I would recommend researching your local stores first. Sometimes they have great deals (ofcourse one can do better at the color and clarity but I have yet to find a better deal under 200$)Too bad it is very delicate/thin. Hardly shows you are wearing it... unless you are wearing a shoulder-off shirt or a shirt collar that will deliberately take the observers eyes to it.
",4
13165,"I was very pleased with the purchase and it arrived just in time for my wife's birthday and Valentine's Day. I used the Super Saver Shipping option and was not disappointed. My wife had a appraisal done for insurance purposes and the color and clarity was spot on. I was able to insure for more than I paid for the necklace because it appraised higher. Will definitely shop for jewelry here again.

13167,"I was hoping it would be a little larger, but the pendant was a well-received gift.
",4
13175,"These are perfect; they are dramatic and not flashy. I wore them to work and received a lot of praises from people. I gave 4 stars because I had to have them repaired prior to first wear. Both posts do not fit well with backs, but its an easy fix.

13184,"The product was delivered in a timely manner and was well packed. The item was exactly what I expected and I am happy with the product.
",4
13190,"I'm giving it four stars instead of five only because it's not professional-quality camera work or film or whatever. I mean, you can kind of tell it was made at home.Other than that this is a terrific yoga workout. It was long but not dull; in other words, long enough to feel like you had a really good yoga class and spent your time and money well. There were lots of original yoga moves, so you don't get stuck doing boring, boring, boring sun salutations. It doesn't overemphasize strength poses, but has a good mix. I liked the instruction to make it your own and be true to your own level. I like it that they switched to different people from time to time so you could see real people with real bodies doing yoga--just like me! I mostly listen to the instructions rather than relying on the view, and I found these instructions did not require me to constantly lose my balance while craning my neck to see the TV.There is a good length savasana (rest pose) at the end of the workout, but it is silent (hooray!) unlike most videos where they yammer on at you and run you through a total body relax at breakneck speed. The only problem is that they don't tell you the workout isn't over, so you open your eyes and check. This would only be a problem the first time though. After the rest pose there is a not-too-long pranayama (breathing) practice. It takes a few minutes and is a good way to end the workout.I hope to see more homemade yoga workouts by real people doing yoga. These really are the best kind. Professional quality filming doesn't make up for lousy workouts. This DVD is a class you would really enjoy. It's definitely worth the price and the five dollars shipping.I hope to see more yoga workouts like this one. I'm tired of doing endless proud warriors and chatarungas. I think this workout is most appropriate for people who have yoga experience, but neophytes might enjoy it too.Another homemade-type of video you might like is Yoga in the Garden of Serenity. Sounds crazy, but it's a terrific workout especially for your neck and hips.

13286,"I have recently bought this pair of earing and the matching bracelet for my son's care-giver. When it arrived my sisters and I were tempted to keep them for ourselves, they were lovely. I particularly like the make and the feel of the bracelet. They are what I would term ""fun"" pieces but not in the least suggesting that they are for younger persons only. I am in my 40s and would enjoy wearing these pieces.It was a good buy at the sale price.Oddly enough I also liked the packaging, the items came in a regular protective brown cardboard box that protected the little ""gift boxes"" on the inside.
",4
13288,"Fairly pleased with these. I like the anklet and the bracelet done in this style quite a bit more, but these are not bad at all.I kind of wished the crystals on the string were flexible such that were a person to move their head they would not always stay in a straight line. I mean don't get me wrong... the earrings dangle and will move. They look to all be mounted on a silver rod, which will swing from the top. Maybe this was done for a reason, but I think they'd look nicer mounted on a loose cord. And for all I know I'd complain about the lack of structure and symmetry.Anyway... from a damned picky person, these are quite nice.

13301,"Got as a mother's day gift. These earrings are good quality, very pretty & versatile. Since they are multicolor, they go with alot of things.

You wont be disappointed!I am in my late 20s, and own MANY pieces of jewelry... mostly white gold and diamond, so we can just say. I like nice things.This is definitely one of 'em and I was very surprised when I got these! They have a very nice weight to it, looks and feel very expensive, is VERY shiny and eye catching, and very well made..not to mention the design is definitely unique and different, yet sleek and stylish.Why only 4 stars and not 5? Because the pendent itself is nice and long, it made the chain look so short, when I first saw it, I wasnt sure how short it was! It didnt even look like at least 16"". However, it does look good on, so it's okay!Buying jewelry online is a hit or miss; I usually end up returning 50% of my internet jewelry purchase, but I am definitely keeping these! You wont see them on anyone else!I also bought the matching earrings which received 5 stars from me.

13358,"i thought this item looked much better in person than online, although still true to the picture online. it was also much heavier in weight than i had anticipated too. i bought it for a christmas gift and the recipient was also very pleased with it. i think it's definitely worth the price.

13407,"I would recommend. Not big. Not flashy. Colored diamonds looks gaudy on a girl anyways, if your to get your special lady a set of blue diamonds these are the right size. Just enough, but not too much that people would think she's got on fakes. The blue is defiantly NOT the color in the picture, not even close. In most lighting they look like a greenish blue, but they still look good. Most men are idiots and when they see a picture of a diamond online they expect it to be the same size when they get them. 1/2 karat is plenty and I have plenty of $$ to have bought her a pair of, say, $5000 earrings, but I already spent that much on a ring once. Remember boys, the trick is to get her a FEW expensive things and than the rest get on the cheep and she won't question. She thinks I paid like $800 for these puppies. Good buy and would recommend and the cheep cheep price of $179.....but hey, one mans view on the situation.

Unauthorized payments were being withdrawn from my bank account, I got nothing but grief from both amazon and GE there was nothing they could do because it was my fault because ""I authorized the payment"" My suggestion keep an eye on both your bank acct and your amazon summary. Also returned items do not get credited to your available credit but to your balance.

13426,"These are very nice blue diamonds! The picture does show more of a blue, but these are more of a blue/green like the ocean, which is more true to the blue diamond. If you want a BLUER...you should look at sapphires. I got these to match a blue diamond ring I purchased while in St. Thomas....now to find a necklace to complete! Nicely packaged. If you want nice blue diamonds for a good price, give these a try!

13429,"I purchased these earrings while travelling in the US diring July 2011. The item was delivered before time (I used next day shipping) in my hotel. The diamonds were quite big and good looking. Of course they were not very sparkling, but you cannot expect so much for so little money.My wife loved them. Overall it was a good shopping experience.Subhendu

13435,"The CZ isn't too big and doesn't look overly fake. It's a nice ring, and it has lots of sparkle.I definitely recommend this ring if you are looking for some ""fun"" jewelry.

13463,"I was actually looking for an onyx & silver ring, but this one looks just as good. It's a good size, but not too big. Shipping was very quick. This is a nice alternative to a wedding band. It has a cool, sleek look & it's very expensive-looking, so it's really a great buy.

13478,"I got baby frog pendant first - it looked nice and I LOOve malachite and I would give it 10 stars if I could. This is one beatiful Piece- heavy malachite bead and so detailed animal I got many-many compliments. When I saw earings I had to get them. The only reason I give them four stars, it's hooks - too thin, I almost lost them when I put it on for the first time. You have to get plastic stopers (.50 in any jewlery store)
",4
13503,"These earrings are very small, maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each. They do appear white, (I don't see any yellow tinting) with a slight, slight bit of grey, which I prefer over a super white look (as you might sometimes find in a cz). These earrings catch the light nicely, showing a bit of rainbow effect. They aren't super, super sparkly or faceted, but they do possess shine and detail. I am very happy with these earrings as they are just what I wanted: something petite and real, set in yellow gold, and with a nice, clean and ""believably"" sparkly look! I also like the fit of the earrings backs, very tight and secure.

13516,"I ordered a smaller size for a piercing on top of ear on curve and they are perfect for the spot. Good shine and clarity for the price. Thanks

13524,"This diamond earrings are good value when it is on sale. Quality meet the specification.

13527,"For the price these earrings are a GREAT buy. The ones I received are quite clear, and refract light beautifully. Maybe I got lucky, but for $100 diamonds I couldn't ask for more!
",4
13532,"I bought these earings as a gift for my sister and she loved them.I had paid $99 for the pair which is a great price, but I do wish they were a bit bigger. That is why I gave them 4 stars. Other than that they are great.

13533,"The color of the sapphires is deep and rich. The settings are sturdy and bright. The timeliness of shipment was impressive -- two days!

13571,"I really enjoy my toe ring, and I have received many compliments on how pretty it is. I recieved it in about 3 days which is the quickest I have EVER recieved anything from on-line. I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys toe rings.

13583,"The bracelet is very beautiful, altough I expected it to be bigger. As a suggestion, maybe a photo with a person wearing it would have helped to imagine the right size before purchase.

13592,"These look really sharp and are very formal looking. It may be a little tricky keeping the 4th stud in your shirt if you have a lil belly! That aside, well made, and I do not know why anyone would complain about the box???! Are you serious?!! LOL! Nobody sees or cares about the box! Great cuff links and studs!
",4
13597,"I completely agree with the previous post. Good quality and very pretty, BUT, it is soooo tiny. I thought they forgot to put the cross on the chain when I opened it. Honestly, you can barely see it. I also agree in changing the chain, to maybe add some substance to the cross. However, I really do like it. I'm just shocked at the size. The 1/2 inch picture is very deceiving.
",4
13599,"Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this necklace, especially considering the incredibly low price. I love the delicate, beaded chain and the added bonus of being able to adjust the length to either 16"" or 18"". I'm glad I chose the .60 carat cubic Z cross. It's small and graceful and could easily pass for real diamonds. All in all, a great find for someone who'd love to have real diamonds and white gold, but doesn't want to pay the price.

13622,"These post earrings are beautiful but a little too small for adults. They would be perfect for a child. But too small for an adult especially someone a little older than have larger holes from wearing heavier earrings over the years. This is the only reason I rated them as a 4 instead of a 5. I know the size is mentioned in the description but you really do not realize the size until you have them in your ears. I would be very interested in the same pair just a little larger.
",4
13624,"Nice earrings but arrived in a small plastic bag. Think it would have shown a little more effort if they would have arrived in a jewelry box suitable for gifting. Very cute pair of earrings though.
",4
13627,"As stated in the other reviews, this is a petite ring. The diamonds are small and the band is very dainty, but the look is exactly what I wanted for an anniversary band and looks great on my small hand. (For your reference, I ordered a size 5 and will likely have to size it down to a 4.5 when I am no longer 8.5 months pregnant!) If you're looking for a delicate band with a lot of sparkle, you simply can't beat the price on this one. Just one star off because I agree that they should offer a point of reference for the scale of the ring, just so people won't be surprised/disappointed.
",4
13629,"I got the ring and I really liked it. The diamonds are very pretty. They are exactly as the rating described. The only reservation I have is the shank of the ring looked much heavier than it is. The gold is thinner than I wanted. But the ring looks good up against my wedding band. I am happy with it.
",4
13634,"It's a good ring for this price. One of the stones, you can tell is of less quality than the others, but otherwise really nice ring. Worth the price.
",4
13645,"It looks great, my girlfriend thought it was real at first and loved it. Just be extremely careful with it because we were goffing around and it broke really easy. I fixed it myself under a magnifying glass and she is going to be more careful while wearing it. Definitly not for everyday usage.
",4
13648,"So my wife loved it, more so then I thought she would. Its just real enough looking and not too over the top.I give it 4 stars becasue she commented on how the clasp feels cheep. It has not yet broken, but based on many of the other reviews here I am somewhat afraid that it will.For now we are keeping it, but just beware. At the moment I am giving it 4 stars since it has not yet broken.

13657,"Just received my bracelet and it's stunning! My mother owns a real tennis bracelet, we compared and mine sparkles just as much for a lot less money! Looks great layered with a watch as well. Very happy with my purchase!

13662,"Looks beautiful! I have also bought the silver one for a gift. Looks like a more expensive brand. I have been wearing it with both my gold and silver rings and bracelets. I have to not hook it to get the size I wanted but still look great on me.

13667,"Quality seemed just fine. My girl enjoys it. It is a bit large for her wrist. She's 5'6"" and it is a bit loose. But it looks realistic.
",4
13674,"I thought it would be bigger, but after seeing it, its hard to tell that its not diamonds. I had to tell my wife that I didn't deplete the savings account.(I know, a jeweler would not be fooled). It looks great & was shipped faster than promised.I would recommend this seller for these purchases. It is holding up very well.
",4
13684,"I love these earrings, they look really sparkly on. The only thing I would mention is that the first time I wore them one fell out of my ear. The post just needing adjusting to connect better. They came in a gorgeous Chinese style pink holder with a pop button which is really pretty and you can store more than just the earrings in there, so I would say it's ideal for a gift.
",4
13700,"I was surprised when I received these earrings of how small they were! I don't think in the description they ever gave a size. They are about a 1/2"" wide. However, they are cute and I like how they latch! Overall, I would recommend these earrings to anyone looking for cute dainty earrings!

13704,"I love this earrings. They are a little big bigger then I expected but I like it.

13725,"Nice earrings. Great value for the price as well. Fits right on the ear as I desired it to. Buy
",4
13732,"I like these earrings a lot. They look real, they're comfortable. The only thing I caution on, is the way they clasp on. They are not very secure, if removing a shirt, they are subject to coming out of your ear. I have had this happen numerous times now. Luckily, I haven't lost one.
",4
13740,"These earrings are really nice. They look just like real diamonds and are the perfect fit. The picture does not do them justice. These earrings sparkle very nicely and have a clean cut to them. Perfect if you cant afford the real thing.

13741,"These are small but very pretty and very real looking. I wear them every day!
",4
13750,"I love everything about them except the clasp. I think the size is perfect, they are very eye catching and latch easily but can unlatch just as easily and then I lose these earrings that I am so attached to.I don't know why people are complaining about the size when they look exactly like they should.
",4
13755,"As I said in my review of the bracelet, (which I bought together), I thought from the pictures that they might be bigger, however my wife was pleasantly surprised.They look much more expensive than they are. This is my first experience with cz but not my last (we're remodling a house). I recommend this seller for their shipping & quality of merchandise.
",4
13769,"These earrings were the perfect size for my daughter. They are attractive. The hoop does not close as tightly as I would like and they have fallen out twice, but I like them and hope that we can keep track of them. I would also wear them as a small, casual every day pair of earrings.

13774,"The pendant is really well designed, it's very pretty. I just did not like the stone (malachite), it was a bad bead.

13784,"Out of about 6 items I ordered at the same time this one arrived first.I got these as a gift for my sister and she seemed to like them.
",4
13785,"Someone else already said it, but yes you can lose them easily. They are a lot smaller than I thought. But still nice, great for a casual or dressy outfit. I got compliments on them. But now, one of them won't close anymore. The little hook bent and it's a bit flimsy and I'm afraid I'll break it if I try to straighten it. Since it no longer really closes securely, I don't even wear them anymore. It's a shame. They aren't very expensive though, so no tears shed if you lose one!
",4
13786,"Based on other reviews, I knew these would be small but I thought the stones might be too large.They arrived in 2 days with standard shipping. The address says Florida but the company (did some research) is in California. They came in a tiny plastic bag in a tiny fabric pouch.My earrings are symmetrical in every way and the stones are well set. They don't reflect the light as much as I'd want but they do not look cheap and the stones are not discolored.The only real drawback to these is the catch/clasp which is just held in place by a notch type of catch. It would be very easy to lose these and wouldn't take a lot of force to dislodge one. I'd say, if you plan on wearing them casually you'll most likely lose one. Great purchase but best saved for special occasions or when you'll remember to check your ears a lot to make sure they're still on.

13787,"BEAUTIFUL, BUT THE PIN IS WEAK, THE PIN HAD BENT AFTER THE 1ST TIME I WORE IT, SO JUST BE CAREFULL NOT TO BREAK IT.

13788,"The earrings were pretty and classy looking, however, I thought they would be just a tiny bit larger. The detail was good and the workmanship was nice.
",4
13792,"I like the product. I find it to be comfortable to keep in my front pocket. It keeps the 5 cards that a carry with me held tight. If you want to get at the card on the bottom of your small stack just remember that you are thumbing through all of them. I holds your bills very securely also. I'm pretty satisfied.The only gripe that I have is that the metal doesn't look at all like what I would expect gunmetal to look like. The picture is deceptive. I thought that I had been sent the wrong item. It looks like a not-so-bright chrome, which almost had me returning it since it cost double the amount of the regular stainless steel. My wife was the one that convince me that it wasn't stainless steel. It just doesn't look like ""gunmetal"" to me.Other than that, GREAT PRODUCT!
",4
13794,"I never liked bulky wallets and used to keep my money and cards loose in my pocket. I didn't want a normal money clip because it didn't solve the loose cards issue. Then I finally bought this product. I was very happy with it and frequently commented that it was one of the simplest but best inventions I've used in a while. I have it holding 3 cards, 1 drivers license and 3 thin MTA metro cards - which seems to be the limit of the card side. The money-clip side can easily hold a big wad of cash.Despite the seemingly good quality, after only a year of use the money clip broke off, making it only half as useful to me. (-1 star) My only other complaint is with the price. For $35 I would expect it to last many years or include engraving (for only $15 extra i could use an ipod shuffle for a money clip)... But since you'll use it every day it is still a decent value. However for my next money clip I'm going to try a similar product I found on amazon for only $10. If it's not as good, I'll reluctantly return and buy another ""smart"" money clip.

13797,"The colours of this stone are absolutely enchanting. I've always loved opals. They're a nice size for a lobe piercing. I found these earrings to be agreeable in appearance. Unfortunately, I have to say beware if you have sensitive skin. Something in the make up of this set set off an allergic reaction to my second ear piercing that I put them in. I've had them for 10+ years. Oh well. I'll save them to give as a present after I have them cleaned. Luck of the draw, I guess.
",4
13799,"Ordered this for my best girlfriend who is 6'0"" tall, got a longer chain from Silver Insanity too, also excellent quality & fast shipping. It's the biggest locket I've seen that isn't exorbitantly priced. Good quality silver, stamped and all. Plus it isn't too heavy so it will work with 1mm chains. Kinda tough to open, but one can't expect everything. Overall, I'm very pleased and will order from this seller again.
",4
13808,"I had been oogling this locket for over a month but it wasn't in stock :-( As soon as it was restocked, I place my order! It is pretty big but not a solid brick either. When it arrived, it had a small dent in it but i pushed it out from the inside of the locket. I wish it had a more tarnished look but overall, I'm very pleased with it!!

13812,"It's beautiful, don't get me wrong. That deserves a 5, however, the dragon has teeth that will tear up a hand rolled cigarette in one swipe. So it's now one of my many show items.

13821,"I love this pendant! A great little gift for someone who needs some good luck. At one-half inch square, it's a little on the small side, which makes it a nice gift for a child as well. The green clover contrasts nicely against the black background, and the square shape is unique also. It has a good-sized bail so you could hang it from a larger cord or omega. Stylish and a good value for a small price.
",4
13822,"I bought this as a Christmas gift. Even though it was very small (3/4""), it was well crafted and looked exactly like the picture. It came in a small pouch inside a black velvet box. The closure clip was not attached and only had one link attached to the horse head. I thought this was done purposely so it could be attached to a necklace by the link or if it was to be attached to a bracelet you could attach the closure to it and then attach it to the bracelet. The gift was well received.

13863,"shame they don't say too much about the diamonds. But the earings look nice :)
",4
13870,"I got this ring when it was on Sale for around $100 and it is definately worth it. No it did not come with a Certificate of Authenticity, but it is a nice ring for the price I paid. It does have a slight imperfection in the diamond, it has a tiny black spot, but not noticeable unless closely inspecting it. It is simple with the right amount of bling, I use it for an everyday type ring instead of my wedding set. If you expect to get a High Quality 1/2 Diamond Solitaire for this cheap amount I suggest you learn more about Diamond ratings. I think it is simple elegance and for the price I paid it was well worth it.

13873,"These cufflinks look very nice. They also look more expensive than what they really are. Also, 2 years later they still look good.

13876,"The rings were just as advertised and delivered quickly.We love them.It does takes a few days to 'break them in' so they spin easily.
",4
13886,"The detail of the skull on this ring is pretty amazing - especially for the price. And the fact that the skull is upraised allows the ring to be used like a signet or seal ring (the skull can be pressed into melted letter wax). The only problem I've had with it is that the back of the skull impression is hallowed out, so that there is air trapped between my finger and the ring, and this causes my finger to sweat a little. But, for such a great looking ring, it's certainly something I can live with.
",4
13903,"I Bought this ring a few years ago- it's trendy and has a nice appearance, although it does bend (and mine did eventually snap, after heavy use and being beaten up a few times(I'm rough on all my rings)). It's a cool small ring, but I like it nonetheless, and will probably buy another!

13912,"I ordered this bracelet and a couple other pieces from Dahlia to wear with my mother-in-law's pink pearl necklace on my wedding day. The bracelet was very pretty but I am not sure that it is 7"" in length. It was a little small and my wrist typically fits a 6.5"" to 6.75"". Luckily there were extension loops which gave me additional room.

Owning a Sterling Silver Gothic Vampire Bat with Rose Pendant is a nice addition to your collection of gothic display case items. The color silver makes the pendant very realistic in design and gives it a spooky, serious look. Owning one makes bats that much cooler.

13956,"Luckily, the ring arrived just before we were leaving for our wedding ( we ordered it a little late :) ) However, it did not fit even though we used the site's ring sizer. We followed their directions to exchange it and are still waiting to receive the new ring.

I really like the style of the ring and it seems to be of good quality, it just seems so huge on my finger. I think the product description should state the size so that others aren't as surprised as I was. I think I will keep it - but must get used to how large it is. It begs for attention - which is not my normal style.

14068,"First of all, this bracelet is pink. I don't know if maybe they sent me the wrong one, or if this used to be a different color, but the bracelet I received was unmistakably pink. If pink is okay with you, this bracelet is about 7 inches (18 cm) and stretchy. The pink jagged looking rock pieces are not aggravating in the least, it is quite comfortable. The stretchy threads holding it together are a red color. The round beads are very smooth and look almost like shattered glass on the inside, which looks very cool. This bracelet is actually pretty good, but they need to stop advertising it as red because it is pink.
",4
14078,"I've worn this chain a couple of times, and it seems very well made. The only thing, which prob can't be helped,is that if you wear it without a charm the clasp slips down constantly. But like i said, it's well made and has the nautical feel i was looking for.

14105,"Got this ear jewelry on a whim. It's very cute. Probably too old for it but I couldn't help myself. It came quickly and I would buy from the dealer again. Only problem with this is that you have to be careful putting it on the ear since the 'arms' have to be pried enough to slip on ear and then pushed back to grip and stay on.
",4
14107,"I love this cuff, it is very cute, I got a lot of compliments from it. Personally I like it better than the typical cuffs you see out there. It was a little hard to put on at first since you need to pry open the arms, but other than that it should fit perfectly on the ear. The only thing I don't like about it is that it can come off very easily. I was wearing a circle scarf and while I took it off, it tugged the cuff right off. Also with something as small as this, it is easy to lose.
",4
14110,"Over all I LOVE this product, its very cute, and comfy on my ear(: the only thing im not crazy about is when putting it on you have to pry open the mans little arms and if you put it on too tight, its a bit hard to get off, and sort of hurts. But over all great piece, and came in like 2-3 days!!! (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (: (:

14116,"...but it fell off within the first week I had it and is lost forever. I really liked it overall, great size, good quality metal, but even with it secured tightly on my cartilage it somehow managed to get dislodged. I feel if it were a bit bigger, at least you could hear it hitting the floor if it comes off. Bummer, I liked the cuff a lot and now it's gone :(
",4
14119,"This cuff is smaller than I expected. I suppose I should have checked the dimensions better. It is still a very nice piece and since I purchased it for my nine year old, it is quite suitable. Very good quality.
",4
14123,"Like the other reviewer, I love the shape of this cuff, but it hurts on the ear and gets caught in long hair. I have tried it on the lobe, upper part of my ear and inside part of my ear and doesn't matter. It's hard to get on and I'm constanly checking to make sure it's there.Even with all that I only took one star away beucase once on it is very cute if you can handle the discomfort.
",4
14128,"I'll start this review by giving full kudos to Sabrina Silver (the seller). They were very prompt in issuing me an email update regarding the shipment, and they shipped via USPS the next business day. With the standard shipping choice, I received the product two days after it shipped. EXCELLENT communication and shipping.As others have stated, these things are TINY. So small, in fact, that I needed a magnifier to get a good look at the detail of the face. As another reviewer stated, the actual product you get might not look as clean and detailed as the pictured ones here. In fact, one of mine looks a little like the pictured images (it's half-black and half-white) while the other one is about 95% black. However, to the naked eye and any distance over two feet, even picture-perfect detail would be virtually impossible to notice because the surfaces are so small.Overall, I'd say I'm satisfied with the purchase; the shipping was fast and neatly-packaged, the price was low, and the imperfections in quality are difficult to notice unless you work with people that wear jeweler's monacles all day long.

My first impression was that the stones are so small compared to the picture shown (I wonder what the 1 ct look like) and that the diamonds are not that brilliant even when viewed in the sun. I'll let my wife decide if she would rather have the larger diamonds after Xmas.

14143,"I put this item on my wish list - any my wonderful husband made my wish come true by getting it for me...and it's really spectacular.

14174,"I purchased the ring for my niece, because she was having her first child. His name is JJ- so she is wearing the ring ever since he was born.
",4
14179,"The pendant is very pretty, but is less than 3/4 of an inch from top to bottom. The stone is purple NOT pink as shown in the picture.
",4
14197,"The earrings i purchased are beautiful. I had a very hard time finding a square cut tiger eye with silver to match a pendant i had purchased. I found these and thought i would give the company a try. They were very reasonably priced. I am very pleased with my purchase. However, these are a Christmas gift so i am not familiar with their durability yet. So far So Good!!

14199,"I bought these earrings for my wife (per her specifications: brown, dangel, and square). She was happy and pleased with them. I'm happy and please because she is. Isn't life grand.
",4
14200,"I really like the earrings. They are a great size and color. I wish mine had a little more variety of the bronze color, but I love them just the same!
",4
14201,"I bought these earrings for my mother for her anniversary.She is a big fan of tiger eye, so I figured that this would be perfect.They are a little small in comparison to the picture.
",4
14203,"i gots these as gift for girl Friend. she love them, and she is the kind of woman who will it me if she doesnt like some thing i get her
",4
14209,"I bought this item for my wife not really knowing what to expect.I went by the review which I read and it looked really nice in the picture.I wasn't disappointed and neither was my wife.She really has not taken it off.She wears it everywhere.The chain is different than it looks,in a good way.Its a petite box chain.Since than I have purchased more from Amazon.I like it cause I don't have to leave the comfort of my home.This is my first review and am writing it because the other reviews have helped me a lot.Thanks again..
",4
14210,"I bought this for my girlfriend, When the package arrived i pulled out the necklace which i was a little disappointed in.First off the chain is not nearly as pretty as the one in the picture and I guess i had my hopes fo high.Also the camera is at an extremely complementing angle, which also made me a little disappointed when i compared the real necklace with the picture.The necklace is very sturdy(I have already dropped it twice).
",4
14212,"I thought it was worth the money it cost. Not high dollar gift but fair quality. I would buy this again or if looking for a quick gift. The necklace is a bit too short.
",4
14213,"The color of the stone was great. The chain is not a snake chain described or pictures but more of a box chain. It's still nice I think but is very short. I wasn't paying attention to the 16"" length described but that is a very short chain length.
",4
14217,"bought this as a gift for my mom and she loved it. It seemed a bit delicate when I saw it but she keeps it on her desk so I don't know how sturdy it would be with everyday use.
",4
14223,"I purchased this bracelet for my teenage daughter for her confirmation gift. It is a beautiful bracelet and the message is awesome! She really loves it and wears it everyday. Being a teenage girl is not easy and she says the bracelet helps constantly reminds her of what is important which helps her stay strong against peer pressure. I would strongly recommend this gift for anyone with a teenage daughter.
",4
14241,"Bought this as a gift for my wife and she loved it.Its been 5 months since I purchased this pair and it looks brand new.Not sure if the $70 was worth it..but.. not forgetting the anniversary...priceless.
",4
14242,"Nice quality, good price at the time. Bought these a as gift for my daughter, she wears them frequently.
",4
14247,"I like these earrings, I have gotten many compliments on them. They would make a nice gift for that someone special.
",4
14255,"Overall a good amount of silver in this piece! It is a bit big on me, about 10 inches; 9"" would be better & I'd say my ankles are average circumference. The quality of workmanship was very nice except when it was on my ankle, the clasp was positioned so that the adjacent disc stuck out about 30 degrees. I had to twist it into the right position, which isn't easy because this is pretty thick silver (I'd suggest a jeweler do this!). That's the only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5. They did a good job of keeping me posted on where it was in the delivery process & they included a nice catalog & information about the artist. Comes in a very nice padded gift box.
",4
14260,"made a real hit on Christmas. Got my 9 year old this and a charm, she can now personalize it any way she wants.
",4
14274,"I received the necklace and realized that the color was a little more orange than red. I bought it for a friend and I think she will like it regardless. The pendant is very large.
",4
14275,"The pendant was much bigger than I was expecting. It's very difficult to find an outfit that this necklace will go with because of the oversized pendent, I haven't been able to wear it much. The quality of the beads is good, the pendant is sort of plastic feeling but you have to touch it to notice. The cord everything is strung on is very cheap.Nice peice if you really want to make a statement and no one's going to look too close.
",4
14289,"i ordered the sterling silver Flamingo, and its really cute and very detailed. the only thing i thought it was going to be bigger. its less than 1/2 &#34; but still cute.
",4
14300,"for the price these earrings are lovely. made very well and a nice size. i really love them
",4
14304,"I purchased the bracelet and earrings that go with the wonderful necklace. just like necklace which is light weight and very delicate looking the bracelet is great quality it looks wonderful against dark brown or tanned skin types because of its golden glow. My only quibble is that in the photograph the bracelet looks bigger and with more strands to it where as in actuality it has just two strands and is quite small suitable for small wrists only I think for the price the makers could have used more amber strands. It arrived in this extremely beautiful dark blue faux velvet box which actually has straps to hold both the necklace and matching bracelet in their positions.The earrings come in their own dark blue velvet box which has a an oval lid. Clearly their designed to last and be worn for special occasions however because this is amber you can wear it during the day and it will not look out of place. I love the fact that the amber has been fashioned to resemble leaves and petals. This is a very feminine piece of jewelry suitable for day and evening wear in my opinion worth the money!
",4
14324,"I ordered this anklet for my December wedding and it's beautiful. I'm very pleased with the product.I'm definitely going to be flashing the ankle around. LOL
",4
14339,"really pretty, a little on the big side but not huge. definitely would work for a charm bracelet
",4
14342,"I like this necklace. I wanted something SS that dropped down and this fits the bill. The charm is pretty, not stunning, but I am happy since it doesn't look as fancy as it could with the CZ in it. Overall, pleased.
",4
14361,"I ordered this ring as a keepsake for my girlfriend before leaving for college, and after hours of searching for ""just the right one,"" I am so glad I found this. It served perfectly as the special reminder, especially considering how central the moon is in our relationship. When ordering, however, make sure you have the right size. I ordered one size to big, and had to order another (though I don't really mind, since I'm now keeping the larger one. ^_^ ). Next to each other, they look the same, but the difference is big when fitting it on.It works exactly as advertised, and looks just as good. Shipping was fast, especially when expedited. It is a great doo-dad to play with throughout the day, and remind me of my special girl. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it attracts scuffs easier than the back of an iPod. My ring has gone to shiny to ""matte"" finish in two weeks, though I don't really mind, since its the symbolism that's most important for me.If this strikes you as ""That thing that would be just right,"" don't hesitate to purchase. Many happy moons!
",4
14363,"I always love the items I get from silverinsanity the spinner ring is great it spins smoothly on its base and fits perfectly
",4
14366,"It is to expect that sterling silver doesn't last that long under hard daily wear. However, I'm surprised that mine lasted pretty well. If I have money again, I'd definitely order from this guy once more!
",4
14368,"The ring is exactly the kind that I have always wanted, but the quality leaves something to be desired. The moons are made of some kind of resin that warps very easily. They will definitely fall out over time. Still, with some silver tarnish and a cotton swab, it's easily remedied.
",4
14369,"Ring was as stated,however it is a spinner ring,and it has a tight spot in it so it doesnt spin as freelyas it should, but a nice ring over all.Im happy with it
",4
14372,"I wear this pendant everytime we go someplace special. Goes well with everyting and looks great
",4
14378,"Several of my friends had purchased bracelets from this manufacturer so I had seen the quality of the bracelet. What a bonus to find a better price at Amazon.com. Very pleased.
",4
14381,"It is smaller than I anticipated; however, it is a nice little piece for the price.
",4
14384,"I bought this as a valentine's gift for my wife. She loved the unique design.I didn't know that it comes with its own chain, so I bought a different (much nicer) chain for it.It took a while for it to arrive, although it is within their estimated delivery time.
",4
14387,"I'll make this short and sweet. It's a lovely necklace. The heart knot is pretty, as is the chain it comes with. I also feel that the chain is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about breaking it, and I like the length. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you can't wear it with the heart in the proper position. It just twists and hangs from the bottom. It can only hang from one of the curved spots, as you can see in the picture. I've had quite a few people tell me my heart had twisted while they tried to fix it! Otherwise, it's a pretty piece and i enjoy wearing it.
",4
14399,"Did not like the color so the company exchanged it for a color I liked. Great company
",4
14404,"The cross is beautiful. I was looking for a hat pin and this was perfect!
",4
14405,"The Mt. Rushmore tie pin is just what I was looking for- a small tie ornament that has a little sparkle.
",4
14420,"Chain is very fine, to the point that I first wondered if it was strong enough to safely hold my pendant. Catch is also very tiny.
",4
14431,"Living in bear country the wife loved it and wears it all the time. A tad smaller than expected but well received.
",4
14440,"The anklet was absolutely gorgeous but I had to send it back because it did not fit my ankle. Please don't make my mistake, measure before you order.
",4
14441,"I really love this item and it is now a permanant fixture on my ankle. I shower and swim with it on, and it has retained it's shine. The actual rose is a bit small and that is why I rated it a 4 and not a 5. Still, good value and quality for the price.
",4
14459,"I do like this set up to show my silver rings. Wish the stand to keep it upright was a little heavier. But in total it works.
",4
14468,"Bought as a gift for my little sis, from myself and my bro, her birthday is sept so sapphire is her birthstone. It is nice, exactly as described...a little big though, but they give dimensions in the product page so if you are unsure just check there.
",4
14484,"I received my order in good time, and I love it! It came in a cute little box and is beautiful. Fits perfectly, the sizing is accurate. I accidentally bent the band a bit because I punched our table (I don't have anger management issues, I was just messing around XD), but I was able to fix it, and it doesn't seem to have weakened the metal at all, so it is made of good tough stuff. I wear it every day, even to work, and it is both durable and lovely.
",4
14512,"Quality of the ring is very good. The craftsmanship of the design is superb. Unfortunately cannot wear ring for extended amount of time due to an allergic reaction with skin (not fault of seller). I would definitely shop with this seller again.
",4
14547,"There's nothing wrong with the artistic features of this ring, nor the workmanship. As others have stated, the silver could be perceived as ""thin"". However, for a ring of this width that's a good thing. Were the silver any thicker, it would be unwieldy to wear. I would suggest you buy a size up from your regular size, otherwise your finger might feel ""smothered"". It gets sweaty pretty quickly. The only thing that would make me say ""WOW!"" would be if the silver were brushed so that it really glowed. As it is, this is a very nice ring, especially on my middle finger, but not a spectacular one. The silver is... well, it's silver, but not a silver that *POPS*. But I'm also INCREDIBLY picky.Recommended. B+
",4
14552,"I recieved the jewlery in a lil velvet satchel..Its great quality ..Better priced then going to NYC ..Seriously I couldn't be any happier with this purchase:)
",4
14553,"I love wearing this ring with other silver/turquoise rings...just wish it were a heavier metal. Its very comfortable to wear on my middle finger....
",4
14576,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas 2009. I never thought of buying jewelry online before, but I didn't have the time nor desire to fight the mall traffic and I think of most jewelers has sheisters anyway, so I felt comfortable after reading the reviews on Amazon.The heart is unique in that the chain flows through it. Both the heart and chain feel sturdy; I was expecting a thin/cheap chain to accompany the heart, so I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing I think could be improved is the packaging. The item basically came in a plastic bag inside a very small, flimsy box. I had to rummage through some old jewelry boxes that my wife had in a drawer in order to really make it presentable as a gift.All in all, I think it's a great item and it was well-received.
",4
14577,"I'm always looking for different jewelry ideas for my other half for gifts, and when I seen the Amazon combo, this paired with the heart earings, I knew I had a good one here. It was a hit with her for a Christmas gift.The heart and chain appear to be fairly solid, especially the chain seemed more solid than your average chain that comes with pendants. The open heart sliding on the chain is a neat idea and not something that is often seen. The price seemed a little high for this item, that is why I give it 4 stars out of 5. I have seen similar for less money, but maybe you get what you pay for. All in all very good quality and an excellent gift.
",4
14581,"So I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. As soon as she saw it, she loved it. I put it on and she had a big smile on her face. About 2 minutes later, the smile turned to a quick grimace of pain. I asked her what happened, and she said that the necklace just pulled some hair on the back of her neck. This has been the chief complaint from my wife about the necklace. At least every other day I take it off her to cut off the hair that gets tangled in the chain. The heart itself is fine, but the manufacturer of the chain should make some of the wives of employees try it on for about a week.... they would make a big change if that were to happen....
",4
14596,"Girlfriend loved it. Only negative is it doesn't come in a nice box, only a plastic bag.
",4
14600,"I bought this as a gift and it turned out great. I was skeptical at first but it looked great when it was delivered. I has not turned green or darkened as I feared it would, so over all it was a nice surprise. Good price and great shipping.
",4
14603,"Gave the sterling heart necklace and chain to granddaughter for her b-day. She loved it, but when trying to open the small clasp, there appears to be a tiny round ball within the clasp. We could not get it open and didn't want to break it. Did anyone have that problem? Maybe we were not opening it properly. If so, please reply. Would appreciate any advice.
",4
14644,"I gave it to my girlfriend for V-Day, and she has worn it often. It looks nice with any outfit. I thought it was a good price for what it is. My GF liked it, I am sure yours will too.
",4
14647,"I had no complaints with the product. It was just as advertised and came within expected time. I'd do business again.
",4
14648,"The pendant looks completely different from the reverse side.They better put another picture showing it.The overall quality is OK but the shape of the pendant makes it easy to turn around and show it's reverse side which looks not so fine as its front.
",4
14692,"My Mother-in-law had a Good Luck Elephant pin that she wore to casinos for years. After her passing, my wife looked for her pin for years without success. After much searching, I found this pin on Amazon in time for Christmas. My wife is thrilled. The pin is beautiful, albeit somewhat smaller then I thought it would be. The price was reasonable compared to some of the other pins I saw. Time will tell if the ""Good Luck"" function really works. My wife feels lucky to have it, so that's good enough for me.Thanks Amazon.
",4
14711,"The chain is a little flimsy, but the tiger eye pendant itself has good color, and is a nice size--my wife liked it, and that's good enough for me.
",4
14713,"I bought these for my mom as a birthday gift. It's her birthstone. They arrived fairly quickly and were packaged well. When I first looked at them they didn't seem to be as dark,as what I viewed online. But when my mom put them in, they were beautiful. The color was great and they had a lot of fire to them. The size was perfect. Not to big, not too small. I would recommend these if you are looking for a nice, simple set of aquamarine earrings.
",4
14721,"If you're looking for a ""perfectly"" crafted ring, skip this one. The shape of the stars varies and upon close inspection, the band has a few flaws.However, if you're looking for a fun ring to add a little sparkle to your hand... then this ring won't disappoint. I appreciate the slight flaws found in this darling ring, as I immediately fell in love with it the moment I placed it on my finger. If it wasn't for the slight flaws, I would have given it 5 stars. This ring is absolutely darling.Update: 3.10.11The ring I wrote this review for is no longer showing on this page. It used to be a silver ring with stars that had czs in the middle of them. I don't understand why this company didn't make a new listing for the marcasite ring that is currently showing.
",4
14731,"Let me first say I absolutely love this ring. It is so pretty. I was hoping to wear it daily as a Mother's ring (my birthstone and my children). But given the size I don't know if I will do that. Maybe just use it for special occasions. I did check out the dimensions, but I guess it failed to register.I posted an image to show how big it is on my hand.I hope to find some more lovely things to purchase :)
",4
14735,"I gave these to my bridesmaids to use on the day of our wedding. They were nice-didn't look too cheap either.
",4
14737,"These are nice earrings in their design and size, but the backs were difficult to remove.
",4
14742,"Purchased these as a Christmas gift for a daughter-in-law who loves hummingbirds. I like the three colors, and although they are a bit smaller than I expected, they are very pretty. They arrived promptly, and I'm sure she will like her gift.
",4
14743,"Bought as a gift. They look nice. Personally, I wouldn't wear them but I have a grandmother who loved hummingbirds and these are right up her alley.
",4
14744,"Just got my 2 pairs of SF hummingbird earrings. They are just as beautiful as I thoughtthey would be and go great with all the green clothes I wear. I got one pair for myself and the other was for a friends birthday. She loved them too. The earrings were shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.The only negative is this company does not participate in the SF sticker program. (buy 5 pairs, get 1 pair free with the stickers.)
",4
14750,"I bought this bracelet for my 22 year-old niece. It arrived in a timely manner and I was very pleased with the quality of the merchandise. I believe it was an excellent value for the price. My niece loved it.
",4
14775,"These earrings were bigger than I expected (they're about 1.5 inches tall), but they certainly had the effect I was looking for!
",4
14776,"I purchased these earrings to wear with my mouse Halloween costume. I got stopped several times by people to have pictures taken and got lots of compliments on these unique earrings. They are pretty big exactly what I wanted to make a statement!!
",4
14778,"In a word - BIG! My wife wanted some fun earrings to wear to work - she manages the cheese section of an upscale deli/market. I did not realize how large the foam cheese earrings were, but she liked them anyway.
",4
14787,"I enjoy the minty flavor of this mouthwash, even though at first it is a little confusing, because it's also salty. I've been using this to clean my lip piercing, and I haven't had abnormally fast healing or anything, but I have been in a few dirty lakes this summer and this stuff has kept me away from infection.Oh and if you want this stuff to last you longer than a week, just unscrew the cap and soak the end of a Q-tip in the bottle and press the Q-tip around your piercing for a little bit, definitely beats buying like 4 bottles of this stuff to last you the whole healing time.
",4
14803,"Everything I thought it would be. It's not a pure black...it's more of a gunmetal color. Edges are sharp, I've accidentally scraped paint of some things with it while working. It seems very durable and lightweight. I really like it. I'd buy it again if I lost it or it was stolen.
",4
14804,"The ring came before the estimated time and looked just as the discripton made it out to look. It is very light weight and durable. The only trouble I came across with this purchase is that the chart they offer to judge what size to get is a little off. My ring was a size to big. I would recommend ordering this ring...but do not use the ring chart on the same site!
",4
14807,"The ring came quickly and in great condition. It was also a fair price.
",4
14818,"Pros: I have seen nicer sterling silver pieces before, but overall, this is a nice pendant for the price. I especially love the fact that it has 4 spots for photos. It's also a nice size - not too huge that it looks awkward, and not so small that you can't even see the pictures you put in it.Cons: They might as well have not even included a chain because it's a piece of junk. I docked it 1 star because of this and almost docked it 2 stars, but I figured most people would buy this item assuming they had to replace the chain anyways. But, be sure to consider that additional expense when weighing the cost of this item. Would have been nice if the locket was more like $25 considering you'll spend another $10 bucks to get a decent chain.
",4
14823,"I gave this to my granddaughter for her birthday and she really liked it. It is real pretty but the chain is really thin.
",4
14839,"I love crystal, and I love Swarovski! But, I have to admit I was disapointed when I received the necklace. The crystals are VERY small. The picture advertised is magnified. I ended up puting the necklace on the rear view mirror in my car. Where I was once disapointed, I am now happy to catch all the beautiful colors, good crystal can bring, whenever I drive.
",4
14848,"The earrings are sweet, just a little tinier (old lady not into metrics) than expected. Kept them anyway. Maybe my granddaughter will like them.
",4
14849,"The earrings came quickly and are very pretty. They are, however, very tiny, measuring only approx 6mm across.
",4
14853,"These earrings are ""cute."" If they were just a bit bigger I would feel comfortable in them. They will make a nice gift instead.
",4
14862,"Closure clasp was not the best as they are difficult to snap closed, but the earrings themselves are very nice.
",4
14864,"These were just a mite smaller then I anticipated, but they were high quality, arrived on time, and I was happy with my purchase.
",4
14875,"These are beautiful earrings but they are too tight so you can't wear them very long. I love them they match everything but I can only wear them for about an hour.
",4
14876,"Nice cross; however, a piece fell offthat I needed to glue back on. Forthe price was ok.
",4
14882,"I ordered this pendant, along with a 1mm 16"" snake chain, and it arrived inside a black velvet pouch inside the shipping box. It is stamped "".925"" on the back of the pendant and on the loop that hangs from the chain. The marcasite catches the light, but blends in with the rest of the design, which is nice. My only complaint is that the long part of the ankh is fragile and I was able to bend it slightly. Something to be careful about.
",4
14894,"I was pleased with this item. My only criticism is that it is smaller than it appears in the pictures, so I was decieved. I was hoping for a larger pendant.. However, my wife really likes it and it came with a nice little velvetine bag in which to store it.....
",4
14908,"Pendant does not include chain and must be ordered seperately which is fine but wasn't clear to me at time of purchase so I was surprised when it came without one...
",4
14922,"The detail is very good. Silver insanity has created another piece of art work for your neck
",4
14923,"As pictured, pretty nice looking piece. I ordered this along with the earings as a gift.
",4
14941,"These are excellent every day wear with everythingearrings. Comfortable and stylish. I have boughtthem multiple times and have given them away to theiradmirers multiple times.
",4
14949,"Fun earrings. A ''tad'' bigger than I expected. But, I got over it, and wear them all the time. Because of this order I figured out how big 20mm, 30mm and 50mm measurements are in regards to hoops! LOL. Basically, this one is about almost 2in.
",4
14953,"the earrings was just what i was looking for not to big and not to small .it was a good buy
",4
14978,"These earrings are very pretty, actually look nicer than the pictures. However, they are smaller than expected but perfect if you wear your hair up.
",4
14984,"In addition to Muppets, I collect Penguins....this is adorable, and I snap it onto my silver chain or bracelet for a little fun when I wear black/white outfits. Picture is exactly what you get. My enameling was perfect, clasp was well-made. No problems...pure fun.
",4
15006,"i used a discount code on this one...i believe it was freefall, from their catalog. i needed a ring i could wear going to the beach and such so i didn't have to worry about my real engagement ring getting ruined. let me tell you, this ring is absolutely gorgeous. it is soooo sparkly and eye catching sometimes i wear it more than my actual engagement set. looove it.
",4
15008,"These Earrings are just beautiful! You can't really tell from the item photo, but the stones are princess cut, which was a wonderful surprise to me, as I presumed they'd be round.Only down side was that the stems are very long, which makes activities like sleeping in them, or talking on the phone a painful experience. I'll probably see if I can't get the stems cut shorter, because that would make them perfect ;).
",4
15010,"in the photo on this site, the ring appears to be dull, faintly brass colored. it looked like an inconspicuous option for men who arent interested in super shiny objects on their hand. well, this ring is very shiny, and has no gold/tan tint to it like in the photo. dont get me wrong, the ring isnt defective or anything, it just doesnt look like i expected it to based on the photo. it looks like a dark silver, shiny. i cant help but think the photo is of a different ring, or it was photoshopped or something. if youre looking for a dull, earthy looking ring like i was, this isnt the ring. its very shiny. good ring, just not the one i wanted. amazon was kind enough to issue me full credit for this discrepancy.
",4
15027,"Saw the other review that these were small, and they are on the small side. I have no issues with handling them or helping put them on my daughter. I actually bought these for my young daughter after going through 2 or 3 cheap play clip on earrings for her where the construction was awful. Thought these, while 3x the cost, would last longer. And after about a month, that certainly seems to be likely. My daughter has also learned to put them on by herself. Great buy and they get used all the time. Worth the price.
",4
15039,"I was pleasently surprised at how nice this ring looks. It is very simple yet elegant. The only problem my husband has with it is that the finish is easily scratched but if you are not studying it closely you can't really tell. I think it is a great buy for the money.
",4
15040,"I purchased this ring for my fiance. Overall we both love it, but as was already stated, the finish does scratch easily. From a distance you can't really notice it, but it is visible if you are really looking at the ring.The service was fast and exactly what we expected.
",4
15047,"They are very pretty, nice for everyday outfit and night too. One of them came without a little stone, as I live abroad it is not easy to make the return, but in spite of it, they are beautiful. I use them everyday!
",4

15053,"I've been looking for a Titanium ring like this for months and the cheapest price I found was over $100. Once I saw the price on it i figured what could I lose. But, this was the same product asa the others I'd seen and for a lot less. The process was quick and easy as well was the delivery. This is the reason I shop online......... oh and by the way the design should read ""Tribal Phoenix""
",4
15054,"I bought this ring last year as a gift for my best friend. The company has astoundingly quick delivery so kudos to them for it. Unfortunately they didn't have his size then (10) so I had to buy size 11. It was big for the finger I intended him to wear it on, but he switches it around or puts it on his chain.The design unfortunately scratches easily, so he takes it off when he's doing rough work such as moving chairs and tables. This is a ring that is probably great for light-active days/events.
",4
15064,"He wanted something to replace his lost wedding ring and since he's always having to take his off for his job, this was the best idea. Price can't be beat, easily to replace when he loses it (yet again) and he likes the design. Sizing seems a bit off, ordered a 13 (his size) but it fits a little larger.
",4
15070,"Its much darker than in the pictures but I dont mind. Very light and beautiful. Its titanium (a big plus) which doesnt give me a rash so big plus for that!
",4
15079,"The nickel-free, sterling fiagaro chain was indeed in superb craftmanship. Light as a feather yet beautiful as a diamond. italian Fiagaro shows enough beauty when wored. It looks unique and expensive but to get these in store would cost from $39 - 113.00 depending the size length. It would been better if they had them here. Overall, beautiful and priceless!

",4
15143,"I was hoping to get a pair with the same darker green shade of jade as pictured to go with an intense green jade pendant I have, but the pair I received was very light--clear (translucent in some areas) of the tube. These are apparently faux jade for the price, and that's more to why I hoped for a more consistent color as pictured. Also, the ear nuts (back fasteners) are very, very small, smaller than the posts need, making it difficult to secure earring without losing the ear nut. And, once one drops the ear nut backing, heaven must help in finding it--they are that small. I lost both the first and second time of wearing and taking off, never could find either, and had to replace with extras I always keep on hand that are more appropriate for the posts' size and adult ears.They are still very pretty earrings--comfortable, lightweight, not too large or small, and are at a good price. I wear them often.
",4
15144,"These earrings look pretty good for $10. They are small, but if you look at the dimensions, you would know what to expect. The color is kind of faint, and I guess that's why they are cheap. Overall, they are fine- a good buy.

15145,"These earrings were smaller than I thought but they are beatiful. I receive many compliments when I wear them.
",4
15165,"Lovely earrings.The best two features are they are extremely lightweight ... just think ... no elongation of your piercing ... and they come with the plastic back around the post. Very comfortable to wear. I've worn them several times and have not had the itchy earlobes syndrome that comes with non-surgical steel.As a buyer you may want to know that the faux pearl is not transluscent as pictured. It is a solid sphere. And the metal is not the pewter color seen in the picture. It is a very shiny silver color.For those who do not page down to the product description and stick with the product specifications, the drop is 2"" which equates to the 5.1 cm seen in the product specifications.As I type, 1928 has a 20% off sale on everything! through Sept 6, 2008. I must go look for more jewelry.

15194,"These were given to me by my lovely hubby for Christmas. I like the fact that they are totally ""plain"";this allows one to wear the pair w/nearly everything(yes, even your fabulous new bathing suit for summer!!!) There is just one ""negative"" about the earrings though--really wish that the set was ""longer"" in length.Anyway, they are very,very well made & the stone is fabulous too----for the $, they look like $200.

15197,"The beads are a bit smaller than I expected, but I am very impressed with the quality-excellent buy!

15200,"I received these very quickly in a lovely little black velvet pouch. The earrings measure 1"" across at the center circle and a full 2"" from the top of the hook to the bottom bead. They are a lot bigger than I thought they were, but I was pleasantly surprised to see them actual size. They can get to be a little weighty, so I remove them after a few hours.They are a real treat!

15226,"11-06-12 This review was written when the name of this item was 'Antique White', not 'Antique Creme', obviously they changed the name since this was written.This is a very nice unit, despite the fact that the color is more cream or blonde (has more tan tones than white tones)from what we consider to be antique white and if you look at the picture you will notice that the slide out shelf when closed requires opening it all the way up in order to get to any items on the bottom shelves and when open you have to bend down almost on hands and knees to access the bottom shelves. However, one of the bottom shelves has a slider which brings it forward a lot. Also almost none of it is solid wood.You have got to love the fact that all the holes were pre-drilled correctly, all the parts were present, including some extras and they all fit together nicely without any problems. The instructions were clear enough if you did not attempt to think you knew better than they do and try to skip some of them (like me) causing longer assembly time. Parts that arrived cracked (I am sure while in shipping) were quickly replaced by CS (customer service) with just an e-mail through Amazon( CS rates 5 stars) without any problem at all (there were 2 of them).This unit is heavy. It comes in two boxes with one weighing 80 lbs and the other 120 lbs. It is composed mostly of particleboard with a very nice finish. Do not attempt to push the unit to a different location once assembled as it may crack or seperate where the levelers on the bottom are located or elsewhere.You can lift one end at a time and kind of walk it if you must, but don't push up on the top molding as screws in particleboard do not hold anywhere near as tight as in solid wood. Also do not attempt to tighten down the screws too much for the same reason as they may lose their grip altogether, just firm, not tight, will be fine.I can not give you an accurate estimate of the time it took me to assemble it as we had to wait over a week or two for the replacement parts because we did not notice the second part was cracked until we were almost done and I made some mistakes. So figure a week for each part. As a rough guess, I would say about 5 hours to assemble.The user of this unit likes it a lot and it looks very nice, holds a lot of things, but pay close attention to the height of the shelf where your sewing maching will go as it is not adjustable. The height is 12 7/8"" according to their diagram but I measure it at 13 1/8"" high. The electrical outlet does not have a way to turn it off, so it is always on. However it does have a red light to indicate it is on.The electrical cord itself is pretty thick (which is good) but I could not get the cord holder the unit comes with in the back to hold it. You push the cord into it and it expands enough that it is susposed to hold it.The sewing machine shelf is rated at 30 lbs weight load. The next shelf up is 25 lbs and the smaller adjustable shelves further up are 3 lbs each. The very top of the unit is rated at 15 lbs (keep that in mind if you want to put a tv or something up there). The sliding shelf that extends out from the unit (work/hobby shelf) is rated at a 25 lb load. The very bottom shelf (1st one above the floor) is rated at 20 lbs.

The downside is the blue color was lighter than I expected, the blue color is a bit too transparent for me. But with the price I paid, I am happy with the purchase.

The stone in the picture is a little darker (as stated). It's actually a very pretty pink. The band nicks easy, but no one is going to look that closely at your ring.

15366,"Bought this ring as a wedding band in a size 10, it was really nice and looked even better than the picture, but when we compared the ring we got to the size chart it was more like a 12.

15369,"My husband LOVES this ring. Everyone compliments him and he's happy to have a non-traditional ring. Plus, his entire wardrobe is black so it matches perfectly.One con:Where the black meets the titanium, it's a tiny bit rough and scratches a little if you touch there.

The craftsmanship is unmatched as i spent hours looking for a good looking RN Necklace for my girlfriend..this is by far the best crafted one that I could find. It doesn't come with a chain or a nice box either, just in a little wax bag.Overall, a little pricey but, then again, I don't know much about Jewelry...the real critic will be my girlfriend when i give it to her for V-day..

15397,"I bought this ring as a Valentine's Day gift and my future wife loves it as a fashion accessory. She wears it all the time. It blings bright and takes over almost her whole lower knuckle. It is very elegant and classy and unique. The one drawback is the fact that it gets snagged on a lot of items such as clothes and fabrics. She recommended not wearing it to work. Overall its a great buy.
",4
15401,"These earrings were as described - they are real silver (they do not irritate my very sensitive ears). They are shiny and have not tarnished at all in the time I have worn them. The posts are a little long for my liking, but they are easily cut if you have the proper tools. I took off one star because the post does not have a catch for the earring back. I believe this is because the earrings are so inexpensive. For the price, however, these cannot be beat. They are the perfect size (check how large you want the ball of the earring before you buy!) and are high quality for the cost.
",4
15403,"My mom got me these off my wish list because they're the regulation size for what females can wear in the Navy and I didn't have any for work. They arrived in a little velvet pouch which was cute, but one of the posts was slightly bent... no big deal right? It still went in my ear no problem. The main issue I have with them is that the posts themselves are engraved, which I've never seen before so it's a bit weird to me. Also, you know how sometimes you get a little gross stuff on the post after you take your earrings out? Just me? I hope not... anyway, it's extra gross when you have to try and wipe your ear junk out of the writing on the post. That being said, they're still functional so I'm willing to overlook the weirdness.
",4
15409,"These look pretty and are a better size than the 12mm ones I purchased first. 10 mm might have been a happy medium for daughter, but of course this is a matter of preference. However, they aren't quite as sturdy as the 12 mm ones.

15415,"The only thing lacking from the petite little sterling silver necklace is sparkle, the CZ's dont seem to sparkle at all, they just look like cut glass. Overall, after having seen the Real deal at [...]**, where the real thing is [...] in 10k white gold and real diamonds, this is a really great alternative, and you cant beat the price. My wife was thrilled with this, and at first glace thought I got her the [...] one, she almost cried.

15428,"The pendant is great. I can't comment on the reviewers who had issues after opening it since I have never done so. Difficult to find a chain to match the beauty of the item, the pictures don't do it justice.

15455,"I needed to hold an item in a cage and Silver Insanity had some very cool options. I selected the Caged Earth Globe Pendant. It was all it was portrayed to be and it came very quickly. The only reason I don't give it a five rating is that I had to glue the clasp closed permanently as it came open when brushed against by shirts or whatever. I would use Silver Insanity again because the selection was so interesting.

15457,"I bought this ring for myself as a Christmas present, since my hubby doesn't share my taste in jewelry.I wanted a vintage style ring, something a little gaudy, as a right hand ring. I don't wear any CZ, so this is my only piece.The quality is very nice. The band and craftsmanship of the setting are super! I was VERY impressed. I absolutely love everything but the large round stone in the center. The center stone does not look like the pic! I am a little apprehensive about how ""fake"" it looks. While you should assume that it will look slightly fake due to the size of the CZ, just be prepared for it to look ""quite"" fake and not exactly the way it looks in the pic. The pic lends you to believe that this stone will be subdued. I don't know how to describe it, but most CZ refracts so much light it looks ""colorful"" (does that make sense?). This in does just that, which is why I normally don't wear CZ. Again despite that, I am pleased with it.I don't mean to knock it too bad. I am still excited to wear it on a daily basis and anticipate many years of wear with this ring.I should add that I'm (obviously) quite picky about my jewelry. I only wear a few pieces, so I want to make sure what I do wear compliments each other. This one has slightly exceeded my expectations.
",4
15465,"I love earrings that are different and artsy. These definitely stand out. At first when I saw them I thought they seemed a bit thin and they aren't made of heavy metal. Some may find that to be cheap looking. However they are light in the ears and they do not weigh down the earlobe which I sort of like since I am not usually a fan of big dangle earrings. They weren't too hard to get in the ear but they are a little bit harder to get out but not too hard. I happy with this purchase and they sent me a catalog with many other choices that look amazing so I plan on ordering more as a treat to my self somewhere down the road.
",4
15468,"Love these earrings! A gift from one of My stable boys that I wear often. They take a minute to get on and off but they are truly unique and I gets compliments on them whenever I wear them. 4 stars instead of 5 bc getting them off aggravates Me. :)
",4
15479,"These earrings are great. It's nice to have such pretty studs. However, I am nit-picky. One of the pearls is slightly off as far as symmetry goes. It's something that bothers me because they are a $50 dollar pair of earrings (not earrings from Claire's or Target). Still, they're beautiful.
",4
15481,"I wanted a simple wedding ring, and this product fits the bill. I would have given it 5 stars, but the actual color is more like stainless steel and not the silver it appears to be in the picture. The ring is very smooth inside and out and is comfortable to wear. The outer surface is gently rounded, so it has more of a profile that a completely flat ring, but it's not obtrusive. Some scratches are already visible after 2 days of wear, but that's to be expected. At least I know it's not going to get bent out of shape!

15486,"I am happy with this Dodgers pendant, I wear it every day! It could be slightly bigger, but maybe being smaller is less tacky anyway. Seems to be good quality silver. I recommend this product for all Dodger fans!

15487,"I bought these thinking that they were larger and would dangle more. They are actually quite small but are still beautiful. Very delicate and understated.
",4
15489,"This handy little item is a genuine set of leg cuffs - these are NOT play cuffs or a cute piece of jewelry, it's the real McCoy! The cuffs themselves are larger than handcuffs (naturally), and are connected by a 14-inch chain - long enough to allow movement, but definitely short enough to give the wearer the idea that they are not in charge. It comes with two keys, and can be ""double locked."" That is to say, they can be placed on someone's legs, and then locked in place so that they do not become any tighter.OK, where do I start? If you are already into BDSM, you will find these to be a great item, restrictive and rather intimidating in appearances. But, you MUST have absolute faith in your partner, as these things do not have quick-release button, and cannot be removed without help. This is for real bondage.If you are just starting out into BDSM, then I would NOT recommend these. Like I said, they require a lot of faith in your partner, and if they are locked on too tightly, your feet will be in danger. Plus, who can forget Stephen King's Gerald's Game?So, I recommend this item to those heavily into BDSM and who want some really restrictive cuffs. I do not recommend it to those just flirting with BDSM.(Review of Leg Cuffs with 14"" Chain - Double Lock)

Though before purchasing and after reading reviews at amazon, i was already mentally prepared that they'll be small... But they are toooo small. If the manufacturer can increase the size of the ruby flower, they can be a big hit.Overall they are still being liked as the design and construction is very good. Good Product.

The O-rings - Its a minor point but in the picture shown they are black but mine are clear. Just a point for the discerning buyer. I did't really care though.

The pearls are very closely uniformed and half only very mild (only detectable from inches away) blemishes.

15786,"Shipped and arrived fast. The pendant is a nice weight and looks very nice and shiny. It did come with a tiny indention in the pendant loop, but hardly noticable, not enough to send it back. Also, it does not have the 925 silver stamp anywhere on it - if it matters to you. The chain is very nice. Overall, it's a nice piece.

15788,"Nice ring, although the colors do look a bit more vibrant online, as usual. Fun to play with.

15811,"I got these in the mail after ordering them two days prior. They came in a cute little velvet bag. I find them very adorable and received many compliments on the first day of wearing them. The only thing I would like to mention is that the blue tint isn't as blue in real life. I plan to order more jewelry from Silver insanity. Also they are each approximately the size of a dime. First jewelry bought online that I was not disappointed in. I plan to wear them whenever I can.
",4
15817,"Bought these to replace the standard plastic stays that come pre-inserted. They do the job much better. For the price you can't beat it.
",4
15826,"These metallic collar stays are replacements for cheap plastic alternatives. They are virtually indestructible, do not bend under regular circumstances, and are just as heavy as needed to keep your collar in its best position.Their size is the one used by most shirts manufacturers, and most likely almost all you plastic stays will be of these dimensions.The metal used is not magnetic.For most men three pairs of collar stays (6 pcs.) are more than enough.
",4
15828,"I was pleased to find these stays at a reasonable price from a reliable vendor. The stays themselves are the right rigidity; a bit wide to fit in most standard collars but the do fit very tightly.
",4
15838,"Bought this item for my mom. She wanted something simple and inexpensive. This fit the bill and she loved it.
",4
15846,"Loved the pendant but comes with an over-sized chain that was too big for my wife.

15849,"Let me start off by saying that I've been looking for a wallet like this for about 7 years. My husband used to have a wallet that was barely long enough to fit a dollar bill in...no extra wiggle room on the ends. And that's what he wanted. I've been hitting and missing with other styles for a long time. And I had JUST ABOUT given up, when I decided to look one. more. time. Needless to say, I was so excited to have found this one!This wallet ""fit the bill"". You can just BARELY squeeze the dollar in. But that's what he wanted. There's not a ton of room for cards and stuff, but it's perfect if you don't like to pack around a bunch of extra stuff. It does have a clear window for your license. It's constructed of leather, but it's not a soft, nice-feeling leather. It should soften up after some use though. Maybe it'll last longer, being a stiffer leather. However, it's not stiff because it's thick or anything. It's a thin, plasticy-feeling leather. But it IS leather.Overall, I was glad to pay the pricetag for this wallet. My husband is going to make sure he likes it for a few weeks/months, and if he does, I'll be ordering more for backups because there is NO OTHER WALLET like this. And I've looked, and looked, and LOOKED for years with nothing even coming close. The only reason I gave it four stars is because feels like it could be made of higher-quality leather.
",4
15855,"I got this 1 month ago and love it! But it does not have alot of atm card or credit card slots but does have an I.D. window. it is a cowhide type of leather and is very fuctional. It has no logos or special disigns on it. Overall this item gets a 4.
",4
15865,"This box is simple and pretty. It can hold A LOT of cards, and over-sized envelopes fit in easily. There is no lock on it and no way to lock it, so that might be an issue for someone; but the lid is fairly heavy and it wasn't an issue for us.
",4
15866,"My fianc&eacute; and I purchased this item to use at our upcoming wedding. We debated going with one of the cheaper options but decided you don't go ""cheap"" (looking at least) for your big day! Once this item was delivered we were elated with out decision. The box itself is extremely pleasing to the touch, looks very professional and opens/closes with ease.The only negative is that there isn't any sort of locking mechanism for it but I am sure it will be a minor worry at the wedding.
",4
15885,"I received these on time, so they do have good service, however, the stones of each earring are different colors. one was more oranges, greens, reds, and had a grayish stone in it, while the other was deeper reds and blacks. and one is longer than the other, even though they have the same amount of stones on each, one just has thicker stones than the other. This upset me, but not worth the hassle of returning because I don't think anyone will notice when I wear them and they are still good quality, nice and sturdy. just beware-- they are not guaranteed to be identical.
",4
15886,"Cute earrings. However, they're much more lavendar than blue. That's my one disappointment. I didn't thinking I was buying purple earrings.
",4
15887,"It beautiful but the setting is slightly crooked; not noticeable to most. The CZ has a nice brilliance but no one would ever mistaken this for real unless they have never seen a real diamond or have glaucoma. I order 4 items but 3 came in about 3 days. The other items I would give a similar review. The rings came in a beautiful silver heart box with a pink bow; great for gifts. The price makes these low risk purchase and I would definitely buy from this vendor.
",4
15892,"One of the reasons I don't like buying jewelry on line is because you can't see the sizeBut that's my fault for ordering themI bought these to give to my neice for ChristmasThey are a lot smaller that what I thought they would beAs a Christmas gift for a young girl, they are OK
",4
15906,"I bought this necklace as a gift for an older woman. I chose it because I wanted something understated and elegant, not cutsey or girly looking. When I received it, I was pleasantly surprised by just how pretty it is in person. Don't let the price fool you. It may be inexpensive, but it doesn't look that way.
",4
15923,"Product was purchased for a gift. The earrings were exactly as pictured and quite nice.
",4
15926,"The charm is of course smaller than pictured. It is fairly detailed for such a tiny link charm. I like it.
",4
15934,"Overall I really like these earrings! Very pretty design and overall well made. I had to bend one of the tops a little bit for the lever back to close properly, but it wasn't a big deal. The stones are also a little dark. I know that garnets are usually more maroon than red, which I like, but from afar they almost look black. Still very pretty earrings though! I got them as a gift and I'm positive my mom will really like them!
",4
15957,"I just recieved my shipment of 15 of these sweet little rings. We plan to use them in the maternity area of a hospital for still births...we will take photos of the babies hands with the rings then give them to the mothers as a keepsake. We often photograph babies hands with mothers wedding rings, but some womens hands swell during pregnancy and they dont wear their rings to the hospital. The low cost of the rings allows us to absorb the cost with a small donation from a recently bereaved family who shared our vision on this project.
",4
15963,"I was looking for a simple band i could wear to add a feminin touch to my marine corps uniform. it looks awesome, its not showy, or deperate, its simple and delicate.. its not the best material i guess but its fine for what im doing, i recommend it for anyone, im not married and i bought it, i was hesitant at first cause it says "" wedding band"" in reality its just a simplistic band that is nice. i love and reccomend it to anyone. also i bought my regular ring size and it fits perfect!
",4
15991,"I got this and while the sizing is a bit off, (buy a size bigger than you normally would) I can't complain. Great rings for a great price. LOVE mine. Wear them everyday!
",4
16006,"Sweet simple band. I like it but mine was a little dented in one spot. Im a little picky so It bothered me. kept it anyway. If you like thin bands you will like this.
",4
16016,"These little bands are worth what you pay for them. They are very inexpensive but make sure that you are aware how thin they are. They absolutely serve the purpose of what I bought them for. I have very small fingers and alot of sterling silver rings that I like are a tad too big. I use these as ring guards of sorts to help make a ring that's too big wearable. I put one on each side of the ring that's too big and it doesn't fall or slip around. Order up a size. I wear about a 4 1/2 ring, ordered size 5 and they are tight. They might bend easily if you're not careful. I am happy with them. I bought 2.
",4
16026,"As an avid jewelry fan, I was drawn to this ring because it seemed cheap but pretty. The latter is actually quite true. Although the stone is much more purple in appearence than it is blue, like a sapphire, I still really like the ring as a right hand ring and think I will get plenty of use out of it.
",4
16031,"I like the case except the edges are grey when you have the phone on its back, which makes it look cheap but that's ok. But otherwise, it fits and is pretty.
",4
16034,"Pretty good item for the money you spend for it. It's a fairly simple piece of jewelry, about an inch in length and fairly light. You can't quite tell from the pictures, but it's missing the back half to allow it to lay on the skin better. That may be a good, or a bad thing for you, depending what you're looking for.
",4
16038,"ordered one of these for myself, had to go back and order two more for gifts. Great size, great price
",4
16042,"The earrings were absolutely lovely. Casual and elegant. I would recommend these to anyone. :)
",4
16045,"these are really cute earrings, but they are a little smaller than what the picture depicts - although had i read the description, i probably would have known that. Otherwise, they are super cute!
",4
16046,"I purchased these as a Christmas gift and the recipient was VERY pleased as was I.Jeanne
",4
16047,"I should have known better after reading the reviews to check the connections of where the chain hooks in to make sure it was closed shut. I loved these and wore them often. Just this past week I went to take them off and the one was missing the chain and ball - ugh! I've made jewelry and have the tools I could have tightened it and closed the loop. I just never thought to look. I liked them so much I think I'm going to break down and buy another pair since they weren't that much money. Just wish I could be buying a new pair and not the same earrings.. Guess if it happens again even if I tighten them I'll have a spare!
",4
16050,"If I could, I would rate these 3.5, but I rounded up. I love the earrings as pictures, but the ones I received have a longer chain so the ball hangs about a centimeter longer than shown in the picture. Instead of the spiral surrounding a hanging ball, it looks more like a spiral around a chain with the ball hanging much lower. I still wear them, but I think the chain length makes them a bit more casual and less classy than they look in the picture.Additionally, Silver Insanity - the vendor - was a pleasure to deal with, and I received a personal email from them about shipping before Amazon emailed me to let me know it had shipped. Some companies don't bother with contacting you unless there's a problem, so it was a nice touch. These arrived more quickly than I expected, packaged in a small box with my other earrings. Each pair was in a small plastic bag, and I loved them all!
",4
16052,"These are definitely a scaled version of what you get in the picture. However, with purchasing quite a bit of my jewelry online, I always check it's actual length before buying. They make a statement without being too large. If you missed where it states the length in the description, they are 1.5 inches long. Still, such a fabulous deal!
",4
16058,"Earrings look really pretty! The design is so unique! They would have been perfect if they were just a little bigger.
",4
16063,"I love these earrings, the only problem I had with them was the ball and chain fell off, but I still love the look of them without it!
",4
16065,"the chain with the ball on it was a little longer then the picture leads you to believe. but they are cute non-the-less. and you cant beat the price!
",4
16070,"OK, I'm sure by now that you know that I'm always complaining that they look smaller than pictured, But I think that some of the beauty of this unusual design is lost in the diminuitive size. They are very delicateand fragile and beautiful and small. My daughter loves hers.
",4
16072,"THE EARRINGS ARE VERY PRETTY, WHEN I PUT THEM ON AND WAS HAVING A LOOK, I NOTICED THEY WERE BOTH GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, NOT WITH A RIGHT AND LEFT, MAYBE, I GOT THE ONLY PAIR THAT WAS TWISTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, ALL I DID WAS OPEN THE LOOP, AND TURN THE SPIRAL THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION,WHEN I BENT IT BACK IT WAS NOT AS NEAT A JOB, AS BEFORE. BUT THAT IS OK, THEY ARE STILL PRETTY, AND I ENJOY WEARING THEM, AND AM THINKING ABOUT ORDERING ANOTHER PAIR. THEY ARRIVED PROMPTLY. JEANNE
",4
16077,"I bought this locket last year for my mom omn xmas. She loved it the only con is that her six garndchildren pix did not fit. Maybe I can buy another one. It is a beautiful and my mom wears it everyday.
",4
16080,"I love this ring. It looks beautiful, and is very durable. I did lose a stone, but I was going through training as a restaurant manager. For this price, it's well worth it. From what I remember, it arrived fast as well. I am very happy with my husband's purchase. I know my place.
",4
16099,"The medal, although very small and light, is beautiful and shiny silver. It also has the traditional miraculous medal inscription on the back. I found it to be the perfect May Crowning present for my 13-year old daughter. I did replace the original chain with a sterling silver chain. The original chain looks like a carnival prize, or something that would come from a bubble-gum machine. I'm sure it would do the job, just not the look I wanted - it wasn't delicate and quality like the medal. All in all, I wish I would have looked for a medal with no chain and purchased the chain separately - I probably could have saved some money!
",4
16107,"I bought this piece thinkiing the chain was also nickel free. However, only the mezuzah itself is nickel free. Otherwise this is a very simple, masculine, elegant piece. Good length without being too much of a ""jesus piece"". Just be aware that you'll have to buy another chain if you have a nickel allergy.
",4
16139,"They were exactly as pictured and I am not disappointed at all.My only niggler is that this earring plus another earring (SCER155 10mm White Genuine Swarovski Pearl And Swarovski Crystals Silver Leverback 1.5"" Long Drop Earrings) came packaged in a LARGE box with bubble wrap. Completely unnecessary!!! As I live outside the US, I had to pay customs to bring it in, and the extra packaging was not appreciated as it cost more.But that aside, the item itself is well worth it. I only wish my social life required it more often! Unlike the other aforementioned earring I purchased at the same time, it does not adapt as well. It's a bit too dressy to wear to the mall with jeans! BUT it is ideal to wear with a slinky black or white dress on a date!It's also a bit pricier than my usual budget for jewelry of this type, but worth it.Very pretty with the different colours, and it looks more expensive than it is.This type of clasp can be a bit tricky at times, so be careful not to break it.
",4
16143,"Keep in mind that these earrings aren't particularly large, but for me they were the perfect size. Lovely quality, beautiful colors. Am very happy with my purchase.
",4
16152,"These are really pretty. I like the colors & the quality. They make a good gift for yourself or someone else.
",4
16157,"I bought these earings for a girl friend. She loves these colors. The combination of colors is really just great with dark long hair in the background. Swarovski is the best.I simply love these earings especially with the very reasonable $19. Go for them.
",4
16175,"They are small-ish, so that is why I give them four stars, but otherwise they look nice and they even look more expensive than they actually are.

16177,"My kids and I gave these to my wife for Christmas and she liked them. Want to be a happy man, have a happy wife.
",4
16203,"My then-boyfriend (now husband) gave this to me for an anniversary about 2 years ago. I have a thing for crystals--and the color family of purple/lavender--so naturally, I loved it. Its length is just right, so that it dangles prettily from the ears but doesn't get in the way. The silver has since tarnished from use, but that's easily remedied. I think it's a bit expensive, though, and I don't know if I would have bought it for myself at this price.
",4
16245,"These earrings are lovely but not as I had imagined, based on the description. The picture on Amazon made it look more like there were 3 solid bars hanging from the hoop but these earrings are actually 6 little dangling baubles. Even though I had imagined these earrings differently, I love them and hope to wear them for many years.
",4
16256,"These earrings are very pretty and sparkle with color. They pick up the colors in your outfit. I love the lever backs too. Great value for the money.

16279,"I gave it to my son's piano teacher.She likes it!It is pretty ear ring.
",4
16283,"I'm a girl that loves sparklies. These earrings were made to order. They are just perfect; very pretty, feminine and the price was the best part. I have several other pieces marked to buy after Christmas. Finding this web site was great.k. marsh
",4
16302,"I originally bought a pair of these (in pink) for one of my nieces for her birthday. She loved them, as did everyone else. I have since bought two more pairs: one in blue for her sister and one in black for myself. They are stylish and can be worn with anything, dressy or casual.The earrings are light and well-strung. The clasp is perfect. There is no way for these earrings to fall out or fall forward as dangling earrings with open clasps sometimes do.I plan on purchasing the matching necklaces and bracelets in all three colors.
",4
16303,"I was really excited when I received my package earlier today. These earrings are gorgeous and simple. The shipping was fast and I love the way the crystals look in the sun. For those who say they are fake, probably don't know swarovski crystals that well. I interned in a Swarovski store so I know that they are real.

16328,"These earrings are exactly as pictured in size and color. The size and design are perfect for casual /everyday wear and they have a lot of sparkle and shine.

16330,"These black and clear crystal earrings were a great gift for my wife for New Years. These went together very well with the dress she wore for our NYE party. The cost to quality factor is very good and I am looking now at something for Valentines Day from the same seller.

16342,"I was also surprised at how tiny the cross is. I bought this for my husband. Although this is to feminine for him, it's perfect for me and I have decided to keep it.

16354,"Purchased this for my grandson's first communion. It is a nice cross for a little boy.
",4
16362,"So many of my friends have this bracelet in sterling silver. I don't wear sterling silver but I love the style of the bracelet. This one will go with all of my other gold jewelry. It is a terrific price too!
",4
16363,"I like the quality of this bracelet. Craftmanship is very good, however, I returned it because I wanted the heavier and thicker kind. But if you're just looking for a simple and light bracelet, this is it!
",4
16366,"This bracelet is light, yet strong. I wear it every day.The gold is shiny and bright, very pretty.I like mine so much that I came back to get one for my friend too.
",4
16368,"I put this item on my wish list thinking it would be a reminder more for me than anyone else, but when my mom sent me an Amazon e-card, the wish list popped up and she ordered me the bracelet! High five to a great mom! :)The bracelet is very feminine without being too dainty...it has a nice presence on the wrist without being too obvious. The hearts alternate from a satin finish to a polished finish which gives texture and depth, also creating an illusion of two-tone gold. The round jump rings from heart to heart remind me of the metal ring belts, so it has a contemporary look as well. The stampato finish on the back is smooth and extremely comfortable. The back has a nice look to it also, which is good because occasionally I find the bracelet has turned itself over on my wrist, and the underside is showing (thus only 4 out of 5 stars).This is one of the cheaper stampato link bracelets available, so it is more affordable, but only the purchaser will know since this looks as though it would cost much more.Thanks again mom...YOU ARE THE BEST!
",4
16376,"I wasn't prepared for the fact that this is a double-length charm. It makes the bracelet fit differently on my wrist since I added it. But the detail is very clear, even the ""green mountain state"" part at the bottom of the license plate.
",4
16377,"The necklace arrived and is as pictured. I must say, I expected it to be a little heavier or more substantial, but for this price, it is lovely. Having the extender makes it work well with many different necklines. I'd give it four stars.
",4
16379,"This is a good chain and you definitely can't beat the price. I wear this with a Mizpah pendant that I got for me and my boyfriend and its danty enough that it doesn't compete for attention. So far i've had it for a little over 2 months and it has not tarnished, and it's been to the gym with me with sweat.
",4
16381,"I was pleasantly surprised by the the nice quality. It wasn't terribly expensive,so I wasn't sure what to expect. It came in a timely manner also. I am pleased with my purchase.
",4
16386,"Had a slight problem with my order, I cantacted the company and it was fixed immediately. Great customer service, which is a real treat these days. I will order from them again.
",4
16396,"I think the earrings are really nice, however I expected them to be flat discs (to match the necklace I have), but they were bowed. Still a great bargain!

16399,"I am used to very lightweight earrings, and by 3PM, I really know I have them on, however they are beautiful and I have gotten many compliments on them!
",4
16435,"Good looking. Great value and quality. Keep well in the ear. Longer than I expected, but it is not a real problem.
",4
16461,"These earrings are gorgeous. Just the right size and two-toned.However, my earlobes are not real big. Therefore, the earring tends to lean forward, because the earring has more weight.I would give Five Stars, if I they would remain balanced. I must adjust throughout the day.
",4
16464,"I wear these earrings almost every day. When I received them they were too wide apart at the top, so I bent them a little and they fit much better. Very elegant looking.
",4
16471,"I agree with most of the reviewers. I have a pair in yellow gold which initially didn't fit perfectly. I gently bent the earring to tighten the earlobe width and was able to improve the fit. It worked for me, but make your own decision to carefully, lightly bend the earrings because they are obviously hollow and could crimp. I agree that the clasp does not seem particularly secure, although I have not had any problems. The earrings are very, very light-weight, thus very comfortable. If they fit you, they are very handsome.
",4
16474,"I bought these earrings for my wife because she was looking for some small gold earrings. These earrings are very elegant and the quality is very nice. The only complaint that I've heard about these earrings is that the clasp on one of them comes undone easily. Overall, this item was a great purchase!
",4
16477,"I don't believe these earrings hang the way the design intended. There is a gap between the front end of the earring and the ear. Looking back at the side view pic now I can see how that happens considering where the center of gravity appears to be. These nuances did not seem to bother the person for whom I bought them so if she was happy, then I was happy. The earrings look like they cost more than they did.
",4
16484,"I bought these earrings for my Stepmother in Seattle, so I never actually saw them. Now she is a refined person with classy taste, so you can't just get her any piece of junk. She said they were perfect and she loved them. That's a great recommendation!
",4
16486,"These are very, very light-weight earrings that can be modified slightly to form a perfect fit to the earlobe. The look is a classic gold hoop with a horseshoe shape fitting very close to the ear, like a ""huggie"" earring, but larger. The size is perfect for daily wear, but would look great for a night out. The u-shaped clasp holds the earring on securely. Great bang for the buck when worn.
",4
16497,"I love this necklace. It was perfect for my daughter's silver and gold cartouche.
",4
16526,"Excellent earrings. These earrings are small and shiny. I wore these earrings a couple times. I have to give these earrings to my niece, she likes small everything.
",4
16531,"Of all the earrings I received for Christmas these were my favorite. Maybe because I bought them for myself. Nice, simple and smallish gold hoops. They are not as big as you would expect judging by the picture shown. After doing a little research on duragold (because really, what is it?) it appears to have a slightly lower percentage of gold in it and reportedly the strongest gold alloy ever. Whatever that is. Still, I love these except the post is a little long and gets caught on my clothes. I'd buy them again and I would buy them as a gift.
",4
16537,"These small gold hoops are a nice purchase - good quality. They don't have much weight or heft to them, but they have good color and shine.
",4
16542,"I needed to replace a favorite pair of earrings; so, of course, nothing was going to be perfect, but I like these and have worn them quite a few times and will continue to.
",4
16553,"Just like the other reviews I am very satisfied with thisPurchase. These earrings are great for every day, night event, travel, etc.With these there is no need for me to take several pairs when traveling.The only reason I don't give a five star rating is due to the color is not as yellow as I would have like it. However, they don't look cheap at all.
",4
16556,"Purchased for my mothers birthday. They are pretty little hoops. Little being the key word. They are small but if you don't like bigger earrings then they will be plenty big enough for you. The polished gold is pretty and mom says they are very comfortable earrings. If Mom likes them then they are okay with me!
",4
16557,"I read through the previous reviews before deciding to purchase these earrings. I am pleased with them, and think that I made a good decision. They are small -- as other reviewers have noted -- but that is what I wanted and the dimensions are reported accurately on the product page. They are also lightweight, which I believe to be a positive attribute. Overall, I find them to be a very nice, simple earring that gives a very classic look and is of very nice quality.
",4
16558,"These earrings are very nice, the color and feel are great. these would have been perfect if they were a bit bigger.
",4
16561,"The color, shape and gloss of these classic earrings make them perfect for almost every occasion. Earrings that will never go out of style and which cane be worn for years.
",4
16570,"Purchased these small hoops during special on Super Bowl Sunday. Glad I got them $10 off as they are small....which was noted by other reviewers. They are solidly made and look like they cost more than I paid. I am certain I will get lots of wear from them.
",4
16572,"For the price, these are very nice and good for everyday wear. Will be giving these as a Valentine gift to my Mom.
",4
16576,"I bought these for myself as a Christmas gift. I really wanted just standard Gold hoops of good quality. The Pros are that these are extremely light and comfortable to wear. You won't even notice you have them on. The cons are that they are so small, you'll only want to wear them when you are at work or dressed comfortably over the weekend. If you're like me, they won't be a go-to for an evening out bcause their size makes them look too casual.
",4
16579,"These earrings were part of my Christmas persent for my wife. They are quite petite, but so is my wife. She wears her hair in a pixie cut, so between her small stature and short hair, these hoops are perfect. They have a nice shine and a substantial width, both of which allow them to be tastefully noticeable. It's too early to know how sturdy they will be, but they seem fine. My wife loves them! We both recommend purchasing them.
",4
16582,"These earrings are not as large as I had thought but they are a good size for work. The workmanship is good and they look good on. They do not pull my earlobes down. I would recommend this purchase to everyone.
",4
16585,"I wear mine for weeks at a time and forget I have them on. They are high quality and very attractive hoop earrings, but much smaller than I had imagined. They are keepers and the price was right!

16588,"I got what I expected from these earrings. Although, I was hoping Amazon would be a little more competatively priced.

16605,"These are precisely what I was hoping they would be. They are classy and classic--exactly the type of every day hoops a lady would wear. They are hollow and not gold-filled, so beware if that's what you're looking for, though I don't know why you'd want that since that would just make them heavy and lead to old lady ear droop. Exactly what I was looking for!
",4
16606,"These are nice earrings, but they are WAY smaller than I expected and I did actually measure before making the purchase. They are about the size of a dime. They are good every day earrings, but if you are expecting larger hoops, these are not them.
",4
16616,"I purchased theses based upon the size. The first pair came broken in the box. The relpacement arrived very fast and in perfect condition. They are very good quality for the price.

16618,"I purchased these earrings thinking that they'd be the perfect si. It was nicely delivered professionally placed the works. If it were a gift that alone would have been great. For me though tho diameter is listed, I was expecting a larger item, they were shiny and beautiful, just not my style. Amazon hasn't ever has disappointed me so I can only blame myself for buying something on a pc instead of in person!
",4
16630,"Gold hoops should be a staple in any jewelry collection, so after shopping around I decided these looked reasonably priced for the quality. These earrings were lighter than I expected but overall I am very satisfied with the quality and look.

16637,"Bought these for my wife who loved them - just the right size - and they look great on her
",4
16641,"I am pleased with the earrings. I would, however, like to add that post or clasp to hold the earring on to your ear is not the best and until my husband bent it, it kept falling our of my ears. I have lost several earrings because of this and it isn't just this pair, but all brands.

16646,"Just as I said.

",4
16667,"The quality of the 14k gold 1"" earings is very good. They are comfortable while wearing them and snap securely in place. They require a firm effort to remove and I like that because I know they won't fall off and get lost as others have in the past.
",4
16675,"The earrings are beautiful and have a simple design. I give it 4 stars for its rather simple design which some may prefer and some may not. It has a beautiful shine. I bought it as a valentine's day gift and it worked :-)

16690,"The earrings are really nice. A Little smaller in diameter then expected, but a good width. Wears close to the ear. Have worn them everyday since I got them with no problems. Would try Duragold again.
",4
16691,"I rec'd these earrings last week, they are beautiful and I have't taken them off yet! I love them! They are the perfect size and are very comfortable even to sleep in. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I feel that for the amount of money I paid for them and they say they are 14K gold, then I think they should be stamped 14K gold.
",4
16697,"These were great earrings except that the wire was thinner than expected. However. so far does not seem to be a problem.
",4
16703,"I ordered these earrings a little over two months ago and I am very happy with them. They are very light weight and they do not pull on your ears. The size is perfect; very ""in"" right now. You do have to pull on the stem pretty hard to get them off because the clasp is very tight. However, so far, so good. They have not broken and the clasp has not become loose or anything. I even accidentally left them in a pocket once and they were put through the washing machine. They were completely fine afterward. I do wish the earrings had been about $20 less expensive. But, overall I love my earrings!
",4
16708,"The hoops are beautiful and as described in the ad. The gold appears to be of good quality. I haven't had any trouble with the earring coming unfastened, but the clasp on one appears mildly loose and flimsy. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and I have been wearing them regularly.
",4
16709,"I've been shopping around for 2"" gold hoops for a while and have been turned off by the high price. I have also wanted to avoid hollow tube type earrings that cut down on the price but also dent very easily and start to look bad. These earrings fit the bill. They are large gold hoops that are study and non dentable. The only negative is that they are thin when you look at them head on, but that's also because they're not hollow tubes. They still have presence though. I like these and they are a great addition to a fashionable woman's jewelry collection.
",4
16710,"my husband bought these earing thursday with express shipping, i reveived them friday. Very nice, perfect size, good quality but my only complaint is the closure. i was very upset when 3 days after i already lost one in the street and never find it.
",4
16720,"My wife loved her gift. She wanted a pair of sterling silver hoops and gold hoops. she loved both. Her only complaint is that the clasp is not that deep on the gold earrings (thus the 4 stars).
",4
16729,"The hoops are the exact size I was looking for, but even as thin as they are, they are still hollow. I was hoping for a solid hoop, but for the cost, they are a very good value.
",4
16730,"I've went through several gold hoops before settling on these. They're the perfect size - not too big, not too small. My only complaint is that the closure bends very easily. I feel like I'm going to brake them every time I take them off.

16731,"The earrings look really nice when worn... and guess what... they get delivered on time too...
",4
16734,"I got these earrings on sale. They are nice and big, but thinner than I had hoped.The closure/clasp seems to be a bit delicate...not sure if it is because it's 14K and the higher K usually is softer.Overall it was a good value for money.
",4
16745,"Nice little gold hoops that are comfortable enough to sleep in and wear everyday. They have a sturdy and solid clasp so I don't worry about losing them.
",4
16749,"My husband purchased these for me to match a white gold necklace. I wear them 95% of the time. I sleep in them. They are very small, but that's what I like about them. They're dainty. The latch is still working well, even though I shower in them and sleep in them. I change them rarely, as they match the necklace which is sentimental to me. I had meant to get some more white gold earrings and just haven't. These have stood the test of time... even though I didn't mean to challenge them that way.
",4
16764,"The small size of these beautiful gold hoops makes them one of the most versatile earrings I own: they can be simple (for work), casual (with jeans and a sweater), or elegant (with a dress, if I want to keep the look low-key, or if I'm wearing a ""statement"" necklace requiring other jewelry to be minimal.)My one problem,resulting in the loss of one star, is that one of the clasps is so tight that it's difficult open and close the earring. In hindsight, I should have returned them for another pair.

16770,"I was misled by the picture! It was too small (I thought) so I decided not to use it as a gift to a fellow worker as intended! All was not lost though as it was the perfect gift for my little niece! I'll know better the next time I shop for earrings ..... definitely a learning experience! Size does matter!!!
",4
16772,"The earrings are quite nice. The packaging was severely lacking as far as presentation as a gift. I expected something better than a small gift bag.

16777,"Bought these as a gift and I have not given them to her yet. But I showed them to some female friends and they thought they were gorgeous.
",4
16778,"Got this for my 6 year old. Well crafted but tiny for the nearly $80 price tag. This is the only reason I'm giving it 3.5 stars instead of 5.
",4
16787,"These are small, lightweight hoops. Perfect for everyday wear, yet shiny enough to go anywhere. I gave a 4 rating due to the posts appearing a little weak. But I believe that is because the base they snap into is tight at first.

16795,"I was happy to see the quality of these earrings once they did arrive. I am pleased with them. For the price..buy them!!

16804,"the earrings are very nice but they are smaller then what I was looking for. the color is very bright
",4
16805,"I ordered this to present it to my wife and I really liked when it arrived. Very well made and looks brilliant. But it was a bit small than expected.
",4
16811,"Bought these ones for $45 for my 6 yr. old daughter. Definitely worth the money and I would buy them again if they had them on stock. The hoops are exactly the size needed for little girls her age and they look amazing.

16832,"Somewhat disappointed in the size of the errings, they appeared larger on the web site pic than they were in real life.
",4
16833,"My wife loved these. I did, too! Simple and pretty. Only issue is the clasp was not secure on both earings. I was able to give a small squeeze and tighten up a bit, but this should have been fixed when made.

16836,"These earrings are really pretty just like the pictures and i couldn't wait to get them. Only bad thing was they were dented when i got them.
",4
16839,"I ordered these during the gold box sale. The earrings are solid but the clasps are bit hard to close. I will probably keep them since like the size of these earrings.
",4
16842,"They are very nice and light weight although I would have liked them to be a bit larger. It was difficult to determine the size as I'm not very familar with metric sizing. It did state that they would arrive in velvet bag, (just in a plastic bag inside a small box) however, as they were for myself and not a gift it really wasn't important.
",4
16845,"Bought these for my wife for Christmas 2010. She likes them alot, not too big so she is able to wear them at work, or a night out.

16859,"These earrings are really lovely but smaller than I expected. I was actually going to return them but decided to keep them because they really are nice.
",4
16871,"I was planning to buy silver earrings, but when these went on sale, I was able to get them instead! What a great value! They are small, which I like. The clasp is a little hard to open and close, but that is preferable to one that is too loose.
",4
16874,"If you are looking for cheap earings on Amazon, and you order them, don't be surprised when they arrive that they seem cheap ...Honestly, I bought some of these duragold for my daughter, and a larger set of earings for my wife. I had to return my wife's because the build/presentation was just too cheap.However, they are gold, and so for sensitive ears or younger ears (where the earings run the risk of being lost or misplaced) they look fine, and the price was great. Also, the clasp was pretty strong, and at this size are not heavy.
",4
16881,"I ordered these because I have a metal allergy and can only wear gold earrings, and I like smaller, plainer styles. These look spot-on. They're small (just barely smaller than a dime) and lightweight, but still noticeable when you wear them. They are very pretty and they don't irritate my ears at all.The problem with these earrings is the clasp. They are not very reliable. When I received these, I had to fix one of the clasps myself because it was set too wide and wouldn't hold the post. (Fixable with some small pliers, but I shouldn't have had to fix it.)
",4
16882,"kind of small but good quality. the wife liked them. what more could you want. plus free freight really helped.
",4
16883,"These are a little smaller than I expected (even though I measured before buying) but they are nice and light to wear daily or for dressy times. They are excellent quality.

16888,"The earrings seem to be good quality...just a little small for an adult...would be perfect for a pint-sized ear! Will make a nice gift for my niece.

16902,"I purchased these as a gift for my wife, she had told me she wanted some simple hoop earings. This item was perfect, because they had two sets, a polished and a brushed finish. This review is for the polished finish. She loved them and has worn them for casual and formal affairs. They are very high quality, and I would have expected to pay much more in a regular jewlery store. In the future, I will purchase with much more confidence.14k Yellow Gold Half Round Hoop Earrings

",4
16912,"These are a perfect size and price for my 11 year old daughter. They would be too small for an adult woman. The prong is not too large in diameter. Some earring prongs are just too large for my daughter and just don't go through her ear.
",4
16914,"The size is what I expected but the shape of the earings are not like the pictures. I want to buy thin hoop earings, not the thicker version. And it's hard for me to take them on and off.

16919,"I like this pair of earrings on my niece just not on me. The picture gave me a different impression of how it looked until it arrived and it looked more like a child's earring than for a woman.

16926,"My wife loved these earrings! I gave them as a Christmas gift and she was very pleased with them. They were well made and should last a very long time. They look great on her, too.
",4
16932,"I thought they would be a little thicker, but they are still beautiful.
",4
16937,"These are beautiful earrings, but they are smaller than I expected. I measured them, and they are exactly the diameter that was advertized, but the picture does not match the actual earrings. In the picture, they look skinnier and therefor bigger. In reality, they are proportionately thicker for their size. I am fine with the size and thickness, but it was a surprise.
",4
16944,"Just the size I was looking for. My wife really liked them a lot. They look as good as a pair I paid much more for from a jewery store.
",4
16945,"I knew my wife needed some everyday hoops, so I bought these for her for our anniversary. They look well made, and after a month of almost daily wear, there's 0 marring of the gold, no sign of wear 'n' tear. Given the high price of gold right now, these were a good buy if you're looking for some hoops that will last a long-time.
",4
16947,"It's ""perfect"", she said! On the other hand, I expected it to be ""meatier""! Having no experience at purchasing an earring I relied heavily on the picture and not the detailed specifics! Now I know what to expect vs the number of grams! Still I am ecstatic by the results! Thank-you Amazon!
",4
16949,"I am very pleased with these earrings. They are a nice size and great quality for the price. My only concern has been with the wire that fits through the ear. It seems a little light weight, and actually bent a little the first time I put them on.
",4
16953,"I love these earrings. I love the fact I can hear a click when I fasten them. I have lost several pair of gold earrings in the past. Love Them!! I did not rate five stars because I thought they would be a little heavier.
",4
16958,"These were a gift to myself. They're a little thinner and smaller than I expected, but that's probably more because I didn't read the description accurately than a reflection on the product itself. Otherwise, they're very pretty and I wear them almost every day.
",4
16961,"These are nice and I wear them often, nice size, nice feel. I thought they were a little pricey, reason for 4 stars
",4
16963,"These are attractive gold studs. I personally would not want any larger size. The posts are very thin and the backs are tiny. I have a little trouble putting them on and worry how durable they will be. I would not wear these overnight for concern about how they would hold up tossing and turning, but for work, they are pretty and did not bother my sensative ears.
",4
16987,"They are very nice, but the post should be longer. I like to use stud earrings to hold dangling earrings. I replace the wire from the dangling earrings with a stud. It does not work well when the post is short. These studs have the shortest post I have encountered.
",4
16990,"Perfect size for every occasion. Great also for use with second ear piercings, and I love the fact that they can appear to be almost invisible.
",4
16992,"Attractive studs to reopen my wife's piercings with however one caveat; the posts are UBER thin and the backings UBER tiny so somewhat difficult to ensure they were securely attached at the back. They look great, well worth the money spent (how can you resist 60% off on 14K gold earrings) :)
",4
16995,"These are the perfect size for my second and third ear piercings - not too large or bulky. The gold is shiny and not discolored, and I like the smooth texture (some studs are faceted). The only complaint is that the back on one was loose, and when I tried to close it a little with the tweezers, it bent out of shape - the backs are a little wimpy. But I tried again and it's fine now.Also, I am allergic to metals with a lot of nickel alloy, and these don't bother me at all, so I know they're real despite the good price. I got them for a lot less than I saw at the department stores.
",4
16998,"The (gold) post could have been a bit longer for those who have chubbier lobes; or post earrings could be offered in two sizes: this one and what I mentioned above. The cultured pearl ones I ordered at the same time has a VERY slightly longer post so I know this creation in post earrings is possible. I am very allergic to anything that doesn't have a higher gold content and both the earring sets I ordered must meet this criteria for I had no adverse reaction...except a very slight one from the gold post on this pair being so short: the backing on the back of the earring rubbed and irritated.
",4
17001,"I got this online for my daughter who keeps missing her earings.I could not help noticing how small it was. I really should have used a tape rule to measure it. It was difficult trying to get it in place, my daughter is 11 months and obviously kept turning while i tried desperately to keep it in, the stopper is also so tiny. the hole in it was a bit wide and the earring kept trying to slide through. I had to add pressure to this using my teeth. I must admit it is pretty but use a tape rule and appreciate what 4mm is before buying it.. I wake up everyday to check if it is still on her ear..Suprisingly it is still there..Hmm
",4
17004,"I got these as a gift for my mother. They are extremely pretty and have nice color, and seem pretty stable and solid. If anything happens I suppose I'll adjust my review accordingly.
",4
17019,"I really liked these gold post earrings. However, I wish they had been packaged better. They came in a tiny bag with a barcode taped to one earring. I couldn't find the other earring. I double & triple checked before calling Amazon. The CS rep said to check along the seam inside the bag. It was there, but geez, couldn't they be put on a card or something??
",4
17032,"Nice earrings but they have a short stud. It barely goes thru my earlobe and attaches in the back. If you have thick earlobes, you better reconsider.
",4
17038,"One earring looked beautiful, the other had a dent in the side. Amazon gave me free shipping back and a new pair is on the way. We'll see how the new ones look.Follow up: The new earrings arrived and they are beautiful. My daughter loves them. These are very nice earrings. I upped my review to 4 stars.
",4
17039,"These earings are beautiful. They are a really good size for your ears. Not too big , and not too small.I did not give them 5 stars because the back of the earings are loose. You have to be really careful when wearing them. I would have given them 5 stars if the back of the earings were tight-----making them less likely to loose.
",4
17049,"just a word to the wise: when separating the tag from the earring clasp/back, be sure to use scissors or anything small to cut the tag off. DO NOT PULL THE TAG OFF. the gold bends easily causing the clasp to loosen and fall off the earring post. other than that, the earrings are the perfect size for the average adult female ear.
",4
17054,"As of December 13, 2006, this item appears to be unavailable. Within the past month Amazon ran it for $19 plus free shipping. Supposedly it retails for $40. I took a chance on this and was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure how the back of the earring was going to look; it is completely flat and smooth, and the post comes out from it. A plus feature is that the backs are good sized, not the smaller ones that are so hard to handle and attach. As a matter of fact, the earrings themselves are a little bigger than what I would call ""small"" which is okay. The earrings are differently styled for each ear, that is, one could consider there is a ""right"" and a ""left"" one. Certainly if this item becomes available again for what I purchased it for, or less, it is worth it. I would also consider these as a gift.
",4
17062,"For the money, this made a very nice gift. Well manufactured with a good strong clasp.
",4
17066,"I bought this item to give as a birthday gift. The person that received it loved it.

17069,"The yellow gold was darker than I had anticipated, but still a very nice piece. Good weight.

17076,"I bought these 9 months ago and have gotten so much wear out of them. They are small, but very sparkly and simple. These are a great value!
",4
17081,"Good value, nice looking. I was pleasantly surprised given that it's difficult to tell whether the product that is displayed is often going to be as nice when it's finally delivered.
",4
17086,"I actually bought these earrings for myself. I noticed a number of women complaining about the ""oddly shaped"" post that goes through the ear causing them discomfort. I didn't have any problems, however, I've had large gage earrings in my ears before. For a guy, they are slightly bigger than I would normally like. But, fortunately, because of my style and look, I'm able to wear them well. I've bought other gold earrings for this same price that weigh ""half"" the grams these do, so I'm not sure why people are saying they expected them to be heavier and less expensive. The size of these earrings are exactly that of the size of a nickel. So if your a guy and your not sure, put a nickel up to your ear to get an idea of how big it is. Well worth the price. I paid a good price for a good quality earring and gram weight. You won't be dissapointed!

17092,"It's lighter than I thought, looked like stainless steel to my man eyes, but my wife loved it and it is great for everyday use, so there.

17115,"I was nervous when i bought these for my girlfriend however, they proved to be perfect. Good quality and they are not huge rings at all just small and cute.
",4
17120,"I sent these for my cousin (who has everything!)on her 16th Birthday. When i saw them later they were smaller than I expected----but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated. They are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones. Plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold--I would recommend these.
",4
17122,"These are very nice, great for a basic pair of earrings. Very nice size and I believe these will be great for very day wear.
",4
17137,"The bracelet was for my wife so maybe she should leave the review. All in all it was more sturdy than I expected looking at the picture. We are both happy with the purchase.
",4
17140,"These earrings are a good size but still very light. It is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them, but once hooked they stay safely closed all day. The clasp sytem does not show once the earrings are on - so this is a very clean and classic look. I have long hair and the clasp does not tangle in my hair.
",4
17146,"STILL PERFECT IN 2009!!!!These earrings are beautiful and sturdy but a bit smaller than I expected. they are still a good deal and have good weight and good clasps. I looked at department stores and did not find anything like these or of this quality at either store. I also looked on other websites and would have had to pay more for similar earrings.I WISH I HAD GIVEN THEM A 5 STAR RATING!!!

17161,"These earrings are quite a bit larger than I expected but doable. The snap-lock closure holds them securely and their weight is very comfortable.My hair is long (mid back) and since I wear it loose, the earrings tend to ""get lost"". They would be spectacular with shorter hair or an updo.

",4
17178,"I was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick. However, I think it's a decent buy for only $30.00 I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend. It comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch. Very clean presentation when you open it up. The white gold really shines. The free shipping was FAST...and I do mean quick. I ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day. I've never had a quicker shipment for free before. If your looking for a great deal on white gold earings, I think you've found it.

17186,"I wanted a classic white gold hoop earring not too big for my face and perfect for everyday wear or even dressier occasions. These serve the purpose perfectly because they are classic.
",4
17188,"I bought these earrings maybe 4 years ago and I only paid $35.00. I gave these earrings to my mom so I wanted to them again for myself but after seeing how much they cost, I have changed my mind because I know they shouldn't cost this much even if they're on sale. I know the price of gold right now is high but I just can't force myself to pay this much after knowing that before they only cost $35.00...These earrings are beautiful though. So shiny and perfect size for me...I would definitely recommened it...

17198,"Not too big and not too small. Good quality only problem is the packaging they come in is cheap it's not a jewelry box it a cardboard box so gift giving is awkward.

17203,"I got these as a gift for myself, great quality, sturdy, comfortable to wear, I don't even feel they're there! They're a bit bigger than I expected, maybe next time I'll go for the smaller thicker ones on offer here at Amazon (if they go on sale! hint hint!) Even with my long curly hair they show. I'm very satisfied.Update: More than a year later and these earrings are perfect, I even sleep with them. They get mega abuse and they're still going strong.
",4
17209,"These have become my go-to earrings. They're versatile, beautiful and comfortable -- all characteristics I expect from quality 14 kt gold jewelry. As others have noted, the size is appropriate for both day and evening. The style works equally well at work and for a fun night out.The design of joined twin gold hoops, one white and one yellow, means that you can mix and match your watch band and bracelets and still look put-together. They're a natural choice to accompany any two-tone jewelry you may have. You also can play around with having the white gold closest to your face or the yellow gold closest, which can be useful if you are trying to coordinate with a necklace.I like the security and ease of a snap closure; there's no worry about a backing going missing and having to find a replacement. In fact, for earrings above a certain value, having a snap closure is almost a ""must"" for me.These are comfortable to wear, and I've received compliments on them. The only drawback is remembering to be careful about the amount of pressure you use in snapping the earrings closed; I do wish that the vertical receptacle were a bit thicker, and for that reason, I'm subtracting a star (wish we could rate in half-star increments).

17214,"The two-toned crossover design of these hoops adds more interest and pizzazz to the standard hoop. The size is just right for me: big enough to show off the twist in the design but not so big that it is overwhelming. I also like the weight: lighter than they appear so that I don't feel like I am carrying a load on my ears. I also happen to like the hinge and snap type closure. Good looking gift box, even if it's just a gift to myself. Why not five stars? - Wish that everything that I want costs at least 10% less!

17226,"These are nice for the mature lady. They are broad and I think would look better if you have longer hair.

17233,"These earrings are very nice and suitable for many different occasions and to wear with different outfits. However, what was most impressive was that they were exactly as advertised and the service from Amazon was first rate. They are good value for money.

17238,"My wife loves the earrings but the earring post's course irritation and discomfort when she wears them. Is it possible to get the earrings with a thinner ear
",4
17250,"I got these earrings as a birthday gift from my husband and they are beautiful! They are so perfect and shiney that they almost look too good to be real! The only downside for me is that they are a tad large for my taste. I usually go for small, dainty, huggy type earrings. They look pretty solid and substantial but are actually quite light and comfortable to wear.
",4
17254,"Good quality, as they have sturdy clasps and the gold is treated not to bend easily. I would suggest these earrings because they are plain enough to wear daily and go with both gold and silver. I would put them in and leave them, but they are too bulky to sleep in so I have to take them out at night.
",4
17258,"Nice earrings just some of the brushed polish was not uniform so for someone who is maticulous of jewelry it may be an issue, otherwise I feel was an honest price at the sale price. If I paid full price would have returned them
",4
17263,"My wife likes them very much and has been wearing them quite a lot lately.I have to say that they look very good on her.Shipping was slower than promised (only a couple of days) so I missed my wife's Birthday (my fault for ordering late).
",4
17268,"I have always been partial to gold and silver two tone earrings. I had been looking for a while but haven't been able to find any that are affordable and in a style I like. I saw these and bought them as a birthday gift to myself. They are expensive but worth the price. They look fabulous, even better than pictured. The size is perfect, not too big, not too small. They feel substantial and this classic style will never look dated. The snap clasp is nice and tight but not difficult to close. One drawback, the posts are not round. They are flattened out horizontally, making them too thick vertically. This makes them a bit uncomfortable to wear. I am hoping to get used to that but otherwise perfect!
",4
17287,"I love this pendant. Everyone who has seen it thinks it very unusual and pretty. My boyfriend was upset at first when he realized it didn't ship with a chain but I had saw it didn't list that when I put it on my wishlist months ago. So be aware if you buy it- no chain, just the pendant. The fact that it's actually made in Eygpt just makes it even more special. It's one of my favorite pieces of jewelry.

",4
17352,"I agree with most of the reviews on here, it is a cool idea and goog looking piece of jewelry, but it is a bit smaller than i expected. You really have to get up close to it to even notice the tail and horns.
",4
17355,"I bought this for my wife for valentine's day. I thought it was neat and she loved it too. Like others have said its smaller than it looks. I was expecting it to be small but in the picture it also looks thicker which in reality its very thin, which is what I think everyone is referring to it looking smaller. It still looks great, very unique to a normal everyday necklace. I am deducting a star for quality because a diamond fell out of it shortly after she got it and its not like she wears it everyday.
",4
17357,"I bought mine on sale. For the price I paid, ($69.99) it was a bargain. The chain is VERY delicate, and should be replaced by a heavier chain. As others have stated, it is a little smaller that it looks, but still very nice. I like it.

17359,"I got this for my girlfriend as a gift. She thought it was great. As others have said it fit her personality and is a conversation starter. For the price it is worth it.

17366,"Purchased for my wife a couple of years back and she loved it when she opened it. I love her dearly but she is a little devil. Luckily she knows it. This is little smaller than I thought it would be, but very nice regardless.
",4
17369,"As I read in some other reviews, the chain is thin. I went to a pawn shop and found the perfect gold chain for it (although it was a bit tricky to attach) and now I absolutely love the necklace. It is delicate, so you need to be careful.
",4
17379,"I ordered it two days ago on free super saver shipping (which usually takes longer) and was very suprised when it arrived today. It's cute and even though the chain it comes on is thin - I like that because it puts more emphasis on the pendant itself. As you can tell from the photo - some diamonds are quite dark so it doesn't look like an expensive piece but I got it on sale[..]
",4
17381,"I bought this for myself for a Christmas present because I found it as a ""today's special"". Although it is very small, much smaller than it looks on the picture, I think it's adorable! The diamonds are very sparkly and the design is so unique. My only wish is that the chain was thicker and the clasp was bigger. It's almost impossible to hook it on yourself. I had to get help because I never could get it on.

17385,"it is small......but once you put it one,you will fall in love.wear it alot just for the conversation sometimes

17394,"These are very pretty and dainty. I bought them for my 10 year old sister, and they're the perfect length and weight for her ears.
",4
17397,"For the price, it would have been nice for it to have been 3-D. It's nice sized and very pretty, but feels a bit flimsy. This is a review, not a complaint. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this charm...I'd just have been happier to have gotten it at a lower price.
",4
17401,"My husband bought this for me as an anniversary present. He calls me ""bee"" so this was perfect. The charm is small but attractive, any bigger and I think it would be too much. The chain however is very thin, I am often afraid it is going to break. THis is something I wear everyday.
",4
17402,"The pendant turned out to be smaller than I anticipated. Reviews stated the chain was cheap and suggested swapping. They were correct.
",4
17407,"I saw this exact pendant at a local jewelry store and thought it was adorable. I began searching for it or a very similar piece online as a gift for my mother. She loves flamingos, and this pendant was the perfect birthday gift for her. Once I found the same item from the store here at Amazon.com, I ordered it immediately. The pendant is beautiful. The diamonds accenting the breast/neck of the flamingo are not too small and have great sparkle. The created pink sapphire has a very nice cut and shape, but it is a bit lighter in color than the one I saw at the store. I would have liked a deeper color to the main stone, however the overall presentation is so very pretty. I am very pleased with the purchase.
",4
17413,"It is at such a great price. The diamond is not a nice color but the necklace looks really good anyway.
",4
17414,"First, I'm very pleased with the shipping speed of this item. I ordered on Wednesday and it was delivered the following Monday. The necklace itself is very beautiful and looks exactly as the picture. However, it is much smaller than I anticipated. I was expecting it to be around the size of a nickel but it is nowhere near that. I can't think of anything to compare the size of the necklace but it is even smaller than a dime, if that helps. If I had really considered the specs that Amazon provides, of course, I would have realized that it would not be as big as the picture makes it appear. I'm still very pleased with the item because I feel like it may have been bordering on tacky if it was too large. It is small enough that you have to look closely to observe the cute devil horns - from far away it just looks like a pretty ruby necklace. It is really dainty and delicate and I am thoroughly pleased with this necklace. My one gripe is that the chain is EXTREMELY tiny and fragile. I have never seen such a teensy chain on a necklace! I'm considering replacing the chain with a sturdier one because I am afraid it will break at any time and I will lose this gorgeous pendant. One light tug and I fear the chain will snap immediately. Other than that, I am very pleased with my purchase and recommend this necklace enthusiastically!
",4
17421,"Sometimes it's listed for $59.95 so I thought it was overpriced at $89.95.Now they have a highly optimistic $129.95 with a ""list price"" of $259.95, so once again I will wait to buy.Hey, that sure is a big bunch of ""9s"".
",4
17423,"The product itself is beautiful.The product arrived 5 days late, was not shipped until the predicted arrival date and the company was not very responsive to the first few e-mail.Turns out they were attending a jewelry show with limited access to e-mail. They provided a reasonable explanation for the delay in shipping, offered a complete return if not satisfied with the product and ultimately refunded the shipping charges.Overall rating would be good on the service albeit slow.If you are ordering from this company, give yourself 2 weeks padding and you'll be more than happy.

17431,"The product looks like the picture, no surprises there. I am very satisfied with the quality, however the chain is so thin that you might consider to replace it with a stronger one.

17437,"Stones are very well matched and brighter than I assumed they would be. The chain is very very fine, so I decided to use a heavier one. Overall, a nice modern piece.

17441,"I found this at Macy's two weeks before my wedding. I tried to buy it, but they were sold out. Amazon had it and I was able to get it in time for my maid of honor (my daughter) to wear on my wedding day! It was a little smaller than I expected, but that just means I didn't look at the specifics that Amazon listed for the item. :)
",4
17444,"It's a really beautiful spakling butterfly.I gave it 4 stars because I think it's small(but not too small)

17466,"I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. ONE OF THE EARRINGS WAS A LITTLE LOSE, BUT FIXED IT MY SELF AND I GAVE THEM TO MY GIRLFRIEND AND SHE LOVE THEM
",4
17476,"The necklace did not seem to be of quite the same quality as some similar earrings I purchased from a different seller at the same time. However, it is of average value for the price, and makes a pretty necklace for a little girl who loves ponies. The delivery was very prompt and the company appears to offer very good customer service.
",4
17490,"I am actually really happy with this. For the price, it is pretty unbelievable. It is a sturdy necklace that still maintains a look of delicateness and class. There are some parts that show a little bit of crude craftsmanship (visible welding on the hollow crucifix) but I think that it mostly just adds to its charm. I would recommend this as a great deal and a really sweet piece for anyone to wear. FYI- it comes in a nice little presentation snap-case and not a box.
",4
17499,"As a computer technician, I do quite a bit of ""radiation tanning""; as a result, I used to leave work just exhausted. I purchased this item on a recommendation from a Kevin Trudeau book. After wearing the Q-Link pendant, I am not exhausted at the end of the day. At first, it wasn't noticible, because it's always easier to notice negative things than positive things for some reason; however, after I wore it for 2 weeks and then didn't wear it one day, I noticed the difference very definitely.One thing I will point out about this pendant is that it did not arrive with the oxidized silver chain as featured in the picture; it came with a black nylon cord. When I contacted Iroams, they responded immediately by sending me a shiny silver chain. While not the oxidized chain advertised, it was a chain that fit the very small opening in the pendant, unlike any chain I could purchase somewhere else. Something to keep in mind if you are wanting the specific chain in the picture and that is described in the details. If not for the incident with the chain inconvenience, I would have rated this product at 5 stars.

17577,"The product came earlier than they stated, which is no problem to me :D It was a gift for my sister. It definitely has some ""bling"" to it. The heart shape is a little hard to see, but it can be told from holding it at the right angle. It does have a distinct aquamarine look to it though. The chain is quite thin and looks as though it would break easily if someone was not careful. The packaging was well put together. Overall my sister was very excited to receive it and has worn it plenty of times since she got it. Definitely would buy from the manufacturer again.
",4
17589,"I like the necklace. It goes with a set I have. But, it seems a little too sparkly for natural London Blue topaz. It could be the round cut. The design is pretty and it matches my other things, OK, so I am keeping it.

17602,"i really do love the colors, the ""spikes"" are not scratchy even though it's silicone. the only thing i didn't like was that both ends are the same size which i didn't realize (my fault 100%) so it does show if you're wearing a tight shirt. i would still buy it because its so cute!
",4
17603,"The cross is nice, but beware of the chain. It is very thin. I bought a replacement for it or otherwise, I would have had to buy a new pendant as well.
",4
17605,"The cross it's self was gorgous but the chain was very thin. I chose to buy a diffrent chain to hang the cross from before I gave this as a gift. I wore the chain with out any charms on it and it broke with in a week.
",4
17608,"This cross is really nice, not big or gawdy but the chain on it is VERY delicate. To the point that I had to replace it with another after about a week. I'm still happy with the purchase, though.
",4
17609,"Maybe I should have realized from the 18"" chain that this was only for kids, but the chain's length is not a problem for me. On the other hand, the clasp is extremely small (roughly 1/4""), making it difficult to take the item on and off.I like the crucifix, but I wish the clasp had been designed for adult fingers.
",4
17611,"The Gold Cross with White Gold sash is a very nice addition to anyone's collection!I was not completely happy with the quality of the chain that shipped with the cross, however, I viewed that as a minor detail and purchased a sturdier gold snake chain with a more secure clasp to use with the cross.
",4
17612,"The delivery of this item was swift...so I was very pleased with that...I am looking for some pieces of jewerly that I could wear with any other pieces of jewerly (gold or silver) and this cross definetly fit the description.But I must say I was kind of disappointed with the size of the chain and the cross itself...the chain does look like it will break with the wrong movement of your body...and being that the cross is small itself, if the chain popped you wouldnt know the cross fell because its SO SMALL!!! But with about $15-$20 you can buy a better bigger chain to suit.But besides that, I really think the cross is ELEGANT!! It will go perfect for a causal day/night night out where you have a low cut shirt that leaves your neck wide open...it will go perfect to fill that gap. It adds style, class, and elegance.
",4
17613,"The cross is very nice and the only reason I gave this piece 4 stars is the fact that the 18"" yellow gold chain is so thin and tiny you can't even see the thing. I went out and spent $300 bucks on a 14K gold chain and it looks nice together. The bail is very large and really needs a thicker, heavier, nicer chain. Actually I don't know why they bothered to send the chain. The chain is almost transparent and I have never seen one this tiny.But if you like the cross it is great, just be prepared to spend some money on a chain.
",4
17614,"Nice quality, but as usual, the chain is rather skimpy. But for the price, I would expect this. Nice detail.
",4
17617,"The cross is very nice and a nice weight. The chain could be thicker but it is a nice package for the price
",4
17623,"I really liked this tongue ring. I was hoping that it would be more ""glow in the dark"" than it is but it is still pretty. I do not wear it with the lifesaver on it because the bar is not long enough and I feel like it is squished on my tongue.

17629,"I was pleased with the time of arrival with the product and it indeed was what I was looking for.
",4
17641,"I agree with the previous reviewer about the pendant, but the chain itself needed replacement as it was not comfortable and did not suit the pendant. The pendant alone was worth the price though.
",4
17645,"I relied on the picture and the price and assumed this was going to be a small necklace. It's not. When it arrived, I was somewhat thrown at the necklace's size. The pendant is a bigger circumference than the bottom of a ""venti"" sized iced drink from the well known coffee chain. :)I have never worn jewelry this large as I am not a large person. However, this necklace is very pretty. I wore it to work today and it quickly ""grew on me"". It went really well with the lime green/cream/dark brown ensemble I wore. I'm about to order a bunch more NVIE necklaces. :)

17646,"Good quality for the price, but the wooden pendant is almost the size of the palm of my hand. I had expected it to be a little smaller. It's still a nice necklace, though.

17669,"The pendant is nice I like the design, and the weight of it. The only thing I didn't like is the amount of copper to brass. I thought that there would be more copper used, however I understand that if it was there probably would be a huge price difference(^_^). Thanks to the maker for providing this item. I definately recommend it.
",4
17675,"I received this as a gift from my husband this morning. I had placed it on my wish list some time ago and had recently been having a rough time, so he bought it as a pick me up gift. He believes in charms and I'm willing to try, we can all use more love and happiness right? My interest in it was because of the 8 pointed star/flower, which is the emblem of Inanna...my patron goddess.The chain is a bit flimsy but I'm used to having to swap out chains on gift necklaces as my neck is pretty large. This one did fit me so I thought I'd try wearing it. I do expect to swap it out next time I wear it because the clasp does not close automatically and I'm afraid I'll lose the necklace.The charm itself is heavy and feels ""real"", very substantial. I love the design and the colors plus the symbolism is just perfect. Both for what it represents to me and the meaning behind it as a gift.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the chain clasp and it was pretty dirty when I got it...I used a jewelry polishing cloth on the charm and the cloth was filthy when I finished.

17678,"Nice quality workmanship (enameling stayed within metal boundaries. Rich, vibrant colors. Order fulfilled with prompt shipping. Will continue to purchase lapel pins as the need arises.

17703,"I love this ring except for the fact when I received it the receipt that came with it which had a link for a website to the instructions, the link was incorrect. I also tried to e-mail the contact e-mail multiple times with no response. The instructions below which someone so graciously posted are correct, agreed are very cryptic and are difficult to interpret, but I would still be trying to put it back together without them. The first time I tried to put it back together it took me upwards of 2 hours to interpret the instructions and get it together. Once you figure it out its not that bad. The grooves that they talk about are located on the INSIDE of the bands. Good luck!
",4
17707,"Ring came quickly, nice condition. Extremely important to keep together, very hard puzzle to put back together and no solution comes with the ring. Ring solutions can be found on line by googling but have to try several to find one that works for particular ring.

17708,"This is a fun item to own, I spent 2 days trying to get it solid again and had to look up the solutionon the internet. I think a solution should be included with the item.
",4
17714,"I have never seen such a nice design 4 band puzzle ring as this. However, when u disassembled it, the interior was not polished at all ( dull grey). Overall, It was a nice design and I have fun putting it back! Solutions can be easily found on youtube video. Slightly thick band for slim fingers like mine but it will suit nicely on third finger or larger finger.
",4
17720,"The ring is very pretty when you get it. However, being curious, I of course took it apart. Therefore, it stands to reason, with no directions I wasn't able to put it back together for the rest of the night. However, when I tried the next day by holding the outside frame of the ring, I did accomplish it without directions. It is very tricky though.The one negative is that when you take it apart, the inside is not very pretty. The outside is silver, but the inside is unfinished and dull. I just think it makes that look a little cheap, although you can only tell when you take it apart.Mine also does not simply fall apart, but it is loose -- but that makes sense because the ring is meant to come apart!
",4
17736,"The ring looks exactly like the picture shown, and after a brief cleaning it fit together easily. The one sent to me was easily a size larger than I had ordered however - perhaps it was a fluke. I'm still going to keep it though. :)

17774,"For the money, I was thrilled. I thought the appraisal was pretty useless; its poor quality copy, and it has typos. It probably takes from quality of the pearls themselves; my reveiw might be 5-stars without it.Beyond the appraisal, I was very happy with my purchase. Bought them for my girlfriend, to replace a pair of cheap plastic (yes, plastic) pearl-esque earrings. You can tell these are quality pearls, the size is good, not perfectly round (but freshwater pearls are hard to find like that). They have nice weight to them, not to heavy, but...they have weight to them. Substance.For the money spent, this is a very quality pair of earrings and my girlfriend was thrilled. Having a thrilled girlfriend is ALWAYS a plus.

",4
17811,"Great earrings, and they are a great size. Just right. Great color, but have kinda of a pinkish tint in sun light. The tint isn't too bad, but I think it is enough to give it 4 stars instead of five. They look just like the picture though so you can be the judge.
",4
17821,"These are very pretty earrings. Setting is sturdy and well made; prongs are secure. Backs fit tightly. Stones have a nicely matched, good, bright color with sparkle. Heart shape of stones is well-defined, but one stone was not cut quite as well (a little crooked on top). I paid about $35. I would buy these again.

I'm sure I would lose these earrings if I did not replace them -- they should have come with bigger, tighter backings.
",4
17852,"I was surprised by how many pearls there were! There are probably 150 pearls all together. Very fancy. Not what I was expecting by the picture. When on the neck it is probably and inch and a half around. The pearls don't sit flat like they do in the picture. I was looking for something more casual, but I definitely have no problems with this. Definitely worth what I paid for it.

17856,"I like these earrings, but the post on one was slightly bent. The backs on these are flimsy and very small; however, I've noticed that is becoming fairly standard on a lot of earrings.
",4
17862,"These are pretty little earrings. They look nice if you are going casual. Both of my stones matched nicely, they are a pretty good size, and I have enjoyed wearing them. However, expect to to see a lot of imperfections in the stones. They also have a cloudy color, not the beautiful vibrant green one associates with emeralds. If I had paid a lot of money I would have returned them, but for well under $100 they are great. I feel that the imperfections should be expected at this price range.
",4
17864,"I've been wearing these earrings pretty much every day since they arrived. This is a great buy. Ive had them appraised since I've received them and well...lets just say I got a GREAT deal!
",4
17867,"I bought these as a gift for my little sister, who, at turning 22 is now old enough to start a 'fine' jewelry collection. These are a great starter, allowing her to ""figure out"" how to care for and clean sensitive stones without a high replacement cost if something were to happen. To be honest, I didn't have very high hopes for the quality of these stones due to the very, very bargain price I paid, but WOW, these were far superior to many ""Name Brand"" emerald studs I'd been considering for 4x the price.Yup, there are inclusions (mostly a very small white vein running through both stones) but, hey, these are natural emeralds. That was to be expected. The setting is solid and attractive, the stones a VIBRANT green, and the cut on the emeralds modern but classic.These probably wont be a piece that will be handed down through generations, but, for the money, I think they are more than satisfactory.Only giving this a ""4"" because one of the prongs was bent on arrival. This was easily fixed using a jewelers loop and some cotton-covered needle-nosed pliers (as to not scar the soft gold surface.) 5 minutes and the pair looked perfect.
",4
17868,"For $30 I wasn't sure what I'd be getting but I was pleasantly suprised. The setting is solid and the stones are a very pretty green. The color is very consistent. Not too cloudy, streaky or spotted like you might expect. They are also bigger than I expected. I'm very happy with them.
",4
17869,"I thought the earings were a great buy. They looked great. The packaging could have been better and with some more information regarding origin of stone, manufacturing etc. Overall very pleased with them.
",4
17870,"They are kind of light in color, which is normal for man made emeralds I guess - my wife loves them though!
",4
17875,"Just know that this is only one inch. It is way too small to be a pendant. Will only fit the chain they give you. Good for a small child I guess. Totally my fault for not reading what was clearly stated. That being said, its makes an ok expensive key ring chachski.
",4
17877,"Bought this for my 8 year old to give his mom as a gift. I'm very pleased with the purchase and the wife loved it. Not more stars because it appears a bit ""clunky"" - but for the price, great buy.
",4
17892,"These were bought for my sixteen year old grandaughter who just received her class ring which is white gold and amethyst. I wanted something to go with her ring. The hooks are fragile and she will have to be careful. The amethyst stones are very light in color but for the price I am pleased.
",4
17903,"I like this piece; the colors of the opal are muted and very pretty; i wish it were a little larger, hence the 4-star review; i am pleased with this item.
",4
17914,"Gave it to my Mom for Christmas. She loved it. It was a little smaller than I expected and more enamel. I was very pleased with the purchase though and expediting of order. Will order from Palm Beach again.
",4
17920,"The color of the stone and gold is vibrant. This is a delicate item; the chain is light and the clasp is small so you must handle with care. A nice item for a young girl or even an older woman who likes gemstones. Nice change if you generally wear bold and funky jewelry. I have enjoyed the necklace and earring set for almost a year and handle it gently.
",4
17922,"This is a brilliant purple colored Amethyst necklace. It is cute and dainty. I like the gold design around it. It is simple yet elegant.
",4
17925,"my husband loved it, it was nice and everything but it didn't had his size...
",4
17941,"great basic string of pearls, wonderful price.The pearls have a strong greenish-blue cast, which is pretty.
",4
17943,"The pearls are not as round as pictured but the egg shape doesn't detract from the overall beauty of the necklace. I think it makes it kind of unique. I'm not sure the pearls hit the 7mm mark but they are still a nice size and the colors are stunning.
",4
17949,"I purchased these for some bridesmaids to wear in my summer wedding. Good color & nice weight. Matched the ""meadow"" green dresses perfectly. Peridot is linked to ""matrimonial happiness....""
",4
17954,"I love these. One of the pearls was perfectly shaped but yes, the other one had a groove around the top edge as the other reviewers mentioned. The grooves on the ones that I received are not hugely noticeable though, so I kept them. I'm sure no one would notice if they were standing a normal distance away from you.
",4
17956,"This bracelet is great looking in person. It dodnt go over so well with him though. Matter of tasted. Keep in mind it is titanium and therefore is grey charcoal colored.
",4
17957,"My only quarrel with this was the incredible thin chain that was included. As much as I tried to keep it in one piece, it broke in less than a week. The talisman itself I liked, I thought it was very nice. I will probably be buying a heavier or more intricate one soon, but this one is very nice, especially for those on low-budget, like I was when I got it!
",4
17958,"I think this pendant is beautiful. people don't even know what it is or how symbolic it is for me and they compliment me on it all the time. the chain that comes with it however - like another said broke within a week. it had numerous kinks in it when it came before i even put it on that i had to get out.just not a good chain at all. but i didn't buy it for the chain i bought it for the pendant and the pendant looks exactly like its picture and is in wonderful condition and i've been wearing it for weeks.many compliments and i absolutely love it. not too heavy - not too big - i feel its just right for a necklace and i wear it daily.i would buy this again - i'd just make sure i also bought a chain for it
",4
17986,"The ring itself (gold part) is not as thick as it is on the picture, but still beautiful. This is the only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars.Overall I am happy with the purchase.
",4
17993,"The chain is delicate but what do you expect for the price. The quartz is nice.
",4
18002,"I liked it so much that I bought two. One as a necklace and another to put on a keychain.
",4
18006,"the only thing i was a little disappointed in was the weight of the gold on the clasp. other than that i love them.
",4
18052,"the necklace is absolutely gorgeous - the picture does not do justice to the actual product. I'm sure my daughter will just love it.
",4
18068,"I like these earrings because they are simple and attractive. I needed some earrings that were blue and am very satisfied with these. They look great with the lapis necklace I bought from Amazon also.
",4
18080,"I purchased this for my sister's graduation. it was beautiful and she loved it. It was perfect for the occassion.
",4
18084,"This bracelet is one of the narrower cuff bracelets I purchased (at 1.5"" wide). It is very light and mostly as pictured. However, mine is darker - the plastic beads definitely brown and not variated in color. The wood beads are a dark mahogany more than a cherry color, but do have a tint of red (not as much as the picture). There are some blemishes in the wood beads - for instance a few have jagged edges and dings. They are of slightly different sizes, which I believe is clear from the picture. One of the end wood beads was missing on the bracelet I received. It fits my small wrist well, although rides up, and it stretches immensely. It is smooth on the interior, so I do not think it would be uncomfortable if tight. When I purchased, shipping was fulfilled by Amazon, which did influence my decision to purchase. I would buy again, but not if it did not ship with Amazon w/ free shipping. I also recommend you check outBeads and Wire Burgundy Cuff-Translucent Beads ""Beaded Bangle Cuff [Translucent Beads - Bur..., which I liked better but does not have the wood.
",4
18110,"I bought this necklace for a Christmas gift and the girl loved. Small, delicate just like she wanted
",4
18122,"The picture is really bad of these. They are very sweet and bright.The only concern I have is they don't screw very tightly in the back. I might use a different back.
",4
18124,"The earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find. My daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one. But that is no bash on the earrings, the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment.I would definitely buy them again.
",4
18131,"I have to say i really like this bracelet.It was a little smaller than I expected but actually its just right not to heavy. I get a lot of compliments on it, a very unusual piece. i love it !!!
",4
18146,"This chain is what you would expect. I bought it to pair with others.
",4
18167,"this anklet is glitter-licious! recently, i lost weight & none of my toe rings fit anymore. this anklet is magnificent! i will have to get another!
",4
18188,"The bracelet is large the stone on either end of the bracelet is a lighter colour, which some people might find slightly irritating, but it is still good value. I thought it had foxtail chains on either end, but it hasn't, it has silver rings. It is nice though.
",4
18198,"ring was very sparkly, fit well for my middle finger, nicely made. recieved many compliments on it. worn it several times and the stones havent fallen out. great ring for the price!
",4
18202,"The item is very nice and I agree with the prior reviewer that it is not an image of a muse, but one of Hercules. Once ordered the seller called and said that it was unavailable and offered a larger replacement at the same cost. A decent thing to do, but we were not interested in the replacement. We asked for a refund, but before that happened, the coin necklace became available and was delivered. Surprise! In any case it was worth the money and I would buy it again.
",4
18242,"Pendant was nice, material a bit soft, and chain too thin for a male..but it was still a great purchase and looks very nice.
",4
18266,"The ring took a little long to ship, but then arrived on time. It is as expected, although when I got it the size seemed a little smaller than what I thought I had ordered. Otherwise a good product.
",4
18280,"I bought this item as a gift for my daughter because I wanted something more ""personal"" than a gift certificate. I wasn't sure if this was a wise choice since jewelry is hard to buy for someone else due to varying preferrences. The bracelet looked great, my daughter wears it all the time and loves it, as do all her friends who have complimented her on it. The price was right for a great gift!
",4
18314,"light, intricate, and very cute! They came very quickly, and the price was very fair! I have a second piercing in my left ear and I like to wear one there so along with my other jewelry I always have a fairy whispering in my ear :)
",4
18329,"I bought this ring for my 12 year old, and it is perfect for her. I was pleased with the appearance it is light weight, and delicate, a beautiful ring and a great price. The gift box was an added surprise. I will buy from you again. Thanks for the great bargains.
",4
18333,"Ring was too small even though I ordered a size 8, so I gave it to my mother.
",4
18351,"My mother was very happy receiving these. I'm reluctant to give anything 5 or 1 star but this one made me think of making an exception and calling it a 5.
",4
18355,"Pretty earings. Pretty stones. The size of the stone is a little bit smaller than I had expected. And the color is a little bit lighter than the picture. But I still like it very much. It does look like a piece of decent jewlry. And it comes with a nice box.
",4
18368,"As I have mentioned in other jewelry reviews, Amazon jewelry is hard to beat from a price point of view and this is no exception - unfortunately a velvet bag is in place of a nice little box and the chains are always in a twisted mess.
",4
18377,"Pendant is a nice medium brown and rope detail stands out. This stone goes well with almost everything in my wardrobe, and picks up tints from whatever color is on my neckline. I'm using my own chain.
",4
18381,"I was expecting a bit bigger pendant but the quality looks OK. The amethyst is nicely cut. The box it came in was a very cheap/lowest end paper box. So -1 for packiging that should go with $5.00-10.00 pendant, not a $150.00-200.00 pendant.
",4
18388,"These earrings are small, but the color of the amethyst stone and the gold is vibrant. Lovely earrings for any woman like myself who prefers stud type earrings or for a young girl who wants something classical. The setting of the post is different from most stud earrings so the earring actually has a top and bottom. The butterfly back is small but this is a plus if you dislike obvious backs to your earrings. So glad I purchased these and the matching pendant.
",4
18390,"I also got the matching pendant. These earrings are a nice size. While they are not bold, they are not tiny at all. They are very noticeable and very feminine.
",4
18391,"These earrings are very pretty. I was a little disappointed in the size - they are very tiny. I guess the price reflects the size.
",4
18392,"I was searching for a birthday gift for my 19 year old granddaughter and when I saw the earrings and necklace I knew that was the exact perfect gift and she loved it.
",4
18399,"It's a really great design, simple enough for casual use and in the same time little unusual. However, the chain is really thin. I would rather prefer something more expensive, and less likely to break and get lost.
",4
18449,"Nice; the ones i got were a little lighter than the picture. But very clear and lots of fire.The only reason I rate them down slightly is that the diamond might not was well be there its so small.Decent price decent stones.
",4
18463,"I bought these for my goddaughter and she likes them. They are very cute.
",4
18472,"The ring I first received was damaged (cracked) but when I asked for an exchange I was sent a new ring without having to return the old one! (it was very low cost to begin with).That's still pretty darn cool, in my book.
",4
18483,"I wa very pleased withthis ring.It arrived in great condition ,early,and was very well pakaged I wold buy fro this company again.
",4
18489,"I was concerned that this ring would look like a plastic ring but it is shiny and beautiful even though it is so simple. Definitely get a half size bigger. I wear a size 6 normally but the 6.5 fit me perfectly. It is also pretty sturdy as I've given it a few accidental hard knocks and it's stayed together fine. Plus it's inexpensive and comes in a cute little box!
",4
18500,"It's very nice but looks kind of flat as opposed to the picture here at Amazon, where it looks a bit rounder and more detailed. Still, very pretty and my wife loves it. Off to the next Ren Faire!
",4
18509,"Cute design and affordable! The band scratches easily though. And there are tiny little gaps where the stones are set. But very affordable and cute! I love the design!
",4
18510,"I haven't worn it a lot yet but it looks really pretty. Nice band (not too big, nor is it super petite). The stones all seem well placed. It's true to size. I'm happy with it.
",4
18521,"I bought this necklace about 1 year ago and it is stunning. I am still getting compliments every time I wear this.
",4
18524,"I do not have much experience in purchasing jewelry. However, I found it to be smaller than I thought for the price you buy it for and the picture is a tad misleading. The gift wrapping was a joke as I put forth eight bucks and only received a decorated box. It is very pretty and I am sure my recipient will like it, regardless. Those are the only two problems I have with it. Shipping was very fast.
",4
18543,"These are beautiful though they are a little large for my taste. Very pretty and high quality though. I also have the matching necklace. It makes a great set.
",4
18554,"I thought this was a great item. Cheap and did it's job. Gave it to my girlfriend of 2-3months for Christmas and she loved it. I was her first love and she'll probably keep it forever. Also, acted as a nice wedding ring substitute for guys trying to talk to her randomly.
",4
18560,"the ring is beautiful. my boyfriend and are both christians and bought them for our 2 year anniversary as promise rings. they're daily reminders of our love and loyalty. the black filling does eventually come off but it looks better without it.
",4
18565,"Quick review here. The black writing on the ring will fade pretty quickly, though I agree with everyone elses comments in that it looks better once it has faded. Overall I am very happy with it, its plain but thats something I like about it.
",4
18596,"Nice ring, for the price. It is flashy, with a large 2-carat ""stone"" that is very sparkly and genuine looking. The band is two tone and upon close examination, the molded metal can easily be identified as not expensive. But unless someone is looking up real close, this ring looks like the ""real"" deal. I have also have a nice ""real"" women's wedding set that is close to this size stone, so when I wear this on my other hand, it balances out nicely. However, if I had just a plain wedding set, this would look fake, I think, since it is so much stone and too flashy as compared to a simple set on the other hand. It would wear well by itself, as a wedding ring or cocktail ring, men or women. It does have some vertical presence, so it might not be good as a pinky ring. But it's a nice ring for the price if you want something with some pizzaz.
",4
18605,"My girls and I were looking for a pretty necklace for me to wear on Mother's Day that represented our family. We wanted something simple but elegant...nothing flashy. This one fit the bill. It is very simple, but also pretty. We all loved it very much. Our only complaint is that the picture makes the pendant look a little more 3D, when in actuality, the pendant is flatter in real life. It would have been nice to have seen more pictures of the pendant from different angles to represent it better. However, we kept the necklace and I have worn it since Mother's Day.
",4
18610,"The design and the symbolism of this pendant is very nice. But it was flatter than I expected - thought it would be more three-dimensional than it actually is. The matte finish on the body of the parents is also not that obvious from the pics. But for this price, I think it's a nice pendant in terms of design, packaging (gift-ready)and sentiment.
",4
18612,"The pendant quality is very good with a nice finishing. The first two pictures give the wrong idea that the pendant is more tridimensional than it actually is. In reality is more flat.The chain is also very good but on the thin side.
",4
18624,"I was so happy to get this necklace from my husband for Christmas. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's a little bit smaller and thinner than I had anticipated. I don't remember if it had the specifications under the description? From far away, it looks like of like a flip flop (like those pendants you can get in Florida or Hawaii) but everyone who has seen it loves it too!! I am very happy with this product overall.
",4
18649,"I have bought three of these as gifts. They are beautiful pendents, the chain is mid-line ... what you would expect for the price. They make a perfect ""Thanks for my new grandbaby gift!"" :)
",4
18653,"It was a gift for my girlfriend. She thought i was like many mens that dont need kids. When I gave it to her, she was like waw excited. She's my wife now and we plan to materialize this pendant. Become a complete family.Loving Family (R) Small Sterling Silver 2Parent/2Child Pendant
",4
18656,"I received this item as a birthday gift from my sister and I absolutely love it. I am not a big jewelry buff- but this is perfect: tasteful, elegant, personal. I have had no problems with tarnishing as others have mentioned. . . and I wear the pendant quite frequently. One detail I couldn't make out in the picture is the texture. Certain areas of the pendant have been machined- which give those areas a softer, brushed look. I am so happy my sister chose this pendant for me- she couldn't have gotten a better buy- I love it!
",4
18685,"I think I may have ordered the wrong pendant. I think it was supposed to be the parents w/ 2 children, not Mom w/ 2 children. Since I ordered this as a Christmas gift, & the 30 days return will expire before it is opened... will I be able to return it after it is opened at Christmas if I did mess up?Silly Mother in Law
",4
18688,"Purchased as a gift. Packaged well - a box within a box, bubble wrapped, etc. It's not quite as ""3 dimensional"" as it appears - not as rounded. I guess that would make it a little more comfortable to wear..? Would definitely be something that I myself would wear though...very pretty!
",4
18719,"I am pleased with this pendant. The one thing that I'm somewhat dissatisfied with is that when I wear it with blue it takes on a greenish hue. I bought it to wear with blue.
",4
18722,"I bought these as a gift for my son and he was very pleased with the design. Very good for the guys out there looking for a hoop earring that's not girlie.The mechanics of this earring have good and bad sides though. The earring is very difficult to ""click locked"" into place on a larger male ear. Perhaps they should consider making the stem a bit longer to fit the male ear. However, that being said, once it is on, you won't have to worry about losing it! My son doesn't remove his, so its not an issue - at least at the moment!
",4
18732,"Product was shipped and packaged nicely. Enjoyed the newspaper that was used as a shock absorber. Kinda cool to read something from the other side of the US....
",4
18745,"Ring was a little smaller than I expected but still very attractive! I'm a huge peridot fan so I'm very happy with ring.
",4
18750,"I didn't actually see the ring, but my granddaughter loves it. Will order again from this vendor.
",4
18751,"I got this ring for my Sister for Christmas. She loves it and I was happy with that and the price good buy. But I do hope it doesnt tarnish like people were saying about the Sapphire one of this ring :S
",4
18755,"The only reason this is getting 4 instead of 5 stars is because the coloring of the stone is a little yellow, but clear and lovely all the same. The setting is nice and there are no snags. I've already been complimented on this ring a few times.
",4
18772,"I do like the Bracelet Buddy. It makes bracelets easier to put on when one has fingers that do not cooperate with little things like clasps etc. The enclosed picture and written direction flyer for both hands is handy. It is ""half-toothless"" so the plastic alligator clamp should not scratch. The molded plastic handle is easy to hold with either hand. With a bit of thought and ingenuity, one could invent other ways to put this device to good use. AND it is made in the USA--YEA! It is hard to find USA-made ""stuff"". Oh, it was purchased for me, myself and I--Grin!
",4
18776,"I gave this to my mom for Christmas and she was ecstatic! She couldn't wait to try it out. The only thing I didn't like was that they had said the claw was coated so it wouldn't damage the bracelet but I couldn't see or feel any coating. Oh well. :-)
",4
18783,"not just for grandma anymore! great product for the single gal who doesn't have anyone to hook those bracelets for her!
",4
18784,"I have given this as a gift to just about all women in immediate family and a niece too.If you know a young girl or a mature woman who wears snap or any clasping bracelets they will thank you for this inexpensive and usefull gift.It is something they will really use and appreciate more evry time they put on one of those fine chain bracelets or the like.
",4
18801,"Love, love, love these earrings. Style was just as I was anticipating. Had to knock off a star, though, because I really think they should come with rubber backs like many hook earrings do. I use a set of rubber backs from another pair that fit snug on the thread. This ensures I'm not going to loose one and that they both stay at the same length. Craftmanship is excellent. Threading is easy.
",4
18803,"I like that the bracelet was avaiable in the 8 inch length. The clasp is a little difficult for me to hold open when putting the bracelet on. Otherwise, I am enjoying the bracelet very much.
",4
18807,"Beautiful ring, but not quite as good looking as the picture. I think the gold looks a little heavier in the picture than it does when it arrived.However, this ring is pretty and has gotten several compliments. It also arrived in great time.
",4
18818,"I have purchased jewelry from Amazon in the past so i had no hesitations about this purchase. I ordered this and some earrings to match. I was pleased with the earrings and felt thhat they were well represented in the pictures.....this necklace to me was not. Im not a person that you can say ""diameter 11mm"" and I get it tell me ""size of a dime, size of a nickel etc"" The stones are lovely and well matched but the actual pendant is the size of a dime. The chain is very fragile looking and and i have trouble fastening it with the tiny ring for the clasp. i was afraid that i would break it soon, I usually wear silver jewelry which has more generous chains but it has stood up to my pretty tough wear requirements. I have also noticed friends wear gold necklaces w/pendants and they seen to be the same type of chain. This is my birthstone and was priced very well so i am pleased with this purchase.
",4
18825,"I purchased this for my 20-year old niece and she seemed really thrilled when she saw it and put it on right away. The chain look a bit too thin for the charm however. But with the price Amazon was charging, it was a great deal!
",4
18833,"Bought these to match a more expensive Tiffany necklace. Cute, but a little light in substance.
",4
18850,"I bought this ring on sale, so for the price I paid for genuine blue topaz and sterling sliver, it is a excellent deal!!! The blue color of the stone is lighter than the picture and the gold area is small, but it's a keeper. I am very satisifed with my purchase.
",4
18856,"I was expecting a flat mesh chain not a rope but still a nice piece of jewelry. It took a really long time to come though.
",4
18872,"I love my ring, and it came pretty fast, was a really good price. But the glue that holds the eye into the ring did not hold that good. I had to re-glue the eye back into the ring, but that was not that much of a big deal. Still like the ring, would buy from seller again !!
",4
18877,"I purchased this locket for a friend of mine. The locket is a little difficult to open, therefore I rated it with 4 stars instead of 5 stars.I printed the photos myself and inserted them in the locket. It was no easy task to put the plastic covering the photos back on but once I was done it looked good and my friend was happy.
",4
18896,"I was pleasantly surprised by the earrings I received. These definitely are a good size -not too big or too small, they have a nice weight to them, and feel and look like good quality jewelry. Happy with my purchase!
",4
18898,"Small earings but a nice size, not big or gaudy at all. Great quality, as pictured... got these along with the pendant which is also nicely made.
",4
18899,"BUT STILL GORGEOUS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL ON THEM, TOO.
",4
18906,"My daughter liked this box. It is very loud but it is for a 4 year old so she likes it.
",4
18907,"Makes for a great gift for a liitle girl. This is the perfect little jewelry box for a great price.
",4
18913,"It is the perfect jewelry box for a little girl who loves fairies. It arrived fast and in great condition. I can't wait to give it to my daughter this christmas.
",4
18917,"The box, although a bit smaller than anticipated, is crafted beautifully. The fairy's face is painted very nicely and the attention to detail is apparent in and out of the box. The music is soothing and enchanting. My 4 year-old daughter loved it... I could see her eyes light up when the fairy dances to the music. :)
",4
18919,"Lovely little jewelery box for any girl (or princess) who is obsessed with anything to do with fairies! I put a number of jewellery bits inside it for her birthday. Only thing that would improve it, is maybe a few seperate compartments or ring rolls - but its no big issue.
",4
18922,"I ordered this jewelry box as a gift for a girl that will be turning 6. I took it out just to test it and make sure it works fine. The music worked well,it was not too loud but not too soft either. However, the swan lake tune played way too fast. I don't know if it was maybe just overwound or it was just made like that. It is different from the speed of the music of another music box we have that also plays swan lake. Anyway, other than that the box is very pretty. The top picture is beautiful, the colors are pretty. One thing that I did not like is the fact that the paper covering the box is not a perfect cutout and at the side of the box it is smaller than the box. I don't know if all boxes are like that, but it is not a big deal. It still looks good. I would recommend this box overall.

18927,"I gave this to my daughter for her 4th bday. She loves the music and fairy and wants to sit in front of it for hours on end. It is very pretty but definitely silver in color, not blue or purple as it comes across in pictures. My only real gripe is the size, it is MUCH smaller than I realized.

18928,"Beautiful music box with the little ballerina that dances when opened. My little girl loves this and it is a great first jewelry box. Beautiful graphics/pictures on the outside. Good value.
",4
18936,"My little girl was so excited to open this little jewelry box on her 3rd birthday. She had asked for a blue music ballerina jewelry box, so it was hard to find, but this fit. The outside is kind of shiny blue.
",4
18946,"Nice jewelry box. It is a more silver than purple color. Very pretty design on the jewelry box. However, the box has a dent mark on the top that is pretty obvious, a dent in the side, not as obvious. The mirror had a nick on the side as well. The box is was packaged in was a clear light weight plastic box that had a rip on one corner. This was a gift for my niece so I had to tape the corner so I could wrap it nicely. She turned 5 and I felt this was a nice gift for her despite the flaws. If she was any older I may think twice about it.

18957,"Our 7 year old granddaughter has dreamed for a long time about owning just such a jewelry box as the Schylling Iridescent Fairy Jewelry Box. When she opened the box and saw the sweet ballerina and heard the delicate tingling music the huge smile and glowing face told us even before she spoke a word of delight and thanks how much she loved her gift. We'd purchased a pair of earrings to place inside, which added to the whole effect as well as reenforcing that the box was not just beautiful and fun but practical as well. We are very pleased to have chosen this gift. Thank you!Schylling Iridescent Fairy Jewelry Box

18960,"Both this for my 5 year old little girl. she loves it .. plays swan lake when you open it. detail is very nice good quality. I would recommend it for you little princesses :-)

18975,"It does the job and holds nicely (for now). I really like the look and feel of this leather cord for the time being. I do have a skinny neck and normally wear my necklaces high, so this works well. Be sure to know how 16"" will fit you.
",4
18976,"I ordered this necklace for myself. Was unaware that 16"" was going to be so short. It is still a nice necklace though. The shipment got to me in a timely manner.
",4
18977,"I had a hard time envisioning this as a thick chain, just because it was so short, meant to wear as a choker. I had to pound the clasp out a little bit to get my snake over it, but it stays in place nicely. I don't regret the purchase, I find that it's quality material. I would have preferred it to be just a little thinner.
",4
18981,"I thought this was nice looking. It was a gift for my 17-yr-old niece, and she must really like it since she lost the original and wanted the exact same one as a replacement.
",4
18985,"It is a nice ring. the stones are a nice dark blue.
",4
18987,"I bought these thinking it would look good in my cartilge piercing, but they're bigger than I was expecting but well worth the price. Plus they're a very pretty blue
",4
18989,"I was pleased with the design of the sweater guard , and my daughter was delighted when she got it as a stocking stuffer. Furthermore,my two granddaughters were very happy with each getting one of the free magnetic bracelets in their stockings!!My daughter had requested the guard, and it was nice to Google it and find one I liked.Thanks to Amazon and Palm Beach supplier.
",4
18997,"This clip was beautiful. The ""freebies"" that came along with it looked cheap (perhaps that is why they were sent to me for free) but the product I paid for was exactly what I needed. They could keep those freebies since I considered them junk. Maybe I'll regift those items...

19001,"This cloth removes tarnish on silver with just a wipe. It is amazing to see the amount of tarnish that comes off onto the cloth.
",4
19008,"The necklace was very nice, better than it looked in the picture. It appears to be well made and has held up so far under extensive use! One complaint is that the box it came in was very disappointing and not suitable as a gift box.
",4
19013,"Beautiful but fragile. Bends easily, but this is to be expected with thin silver jewelry.
",4
19014,"I received this ring and put it on right away. I had it on less than a day and I got a green spot on my finger from the solid band on the bottom. It has been a few days and the green spot has gone away. Other than that, I love the design. Wear it all the time. Something that I bought myself.
",4
19018,"I wanted a simple wedding ring, and this product fits the bill. I would have given it 5 stars, but the actual color is more like stainless steel and not the silver it appears to be in the picture. The ring is very smooth inside and out and is comfortable to wear. The outer surface is gently rounded, so it has more of a profile that a completely flat ring, but it's not obtrusive. Some scratches are already visible after 2 days of wear, but that's to be expected. At least I know it's not going to get bent out of shape!
",4
19026,"These earrings really are fabulous! they offer a lot of movement and sparkle without being too big and heavy for my ears - love 'em!
",4
19043,"It cute and i have no problems with it. Though i didn't exspect that it would blend in so much with my very fair skin
",4
19051,"The necklace is very beautiful - exactly as pictured- also very fast shipping. Thank you!
",4
19058,"Love them. They are a little heavy but I am use to wearing little earrings or studsso I think Im just not use to it. Bigger than I expected but really shinny and pretty.
",4
19063,"This earring set is nice for the price. It has a very clear simulated diamond that looks good when you wear it. Very lightweight, and sits close to the ear. Good for children or adults with small ears or multiple piercings. It can get caught on clothing fairly easily, so be careful or you might lose one.
",4
19087,"It's a lot bigger than I expected (in terms of dimensions) but that's okay because it's so decorative. I'm not sure why it says it can hold 125 pairs though because there aren't 250 holes, unless you're meant to put both earrings of a pair through one hole? I've got about 30-35 pairs in there, with some holes in b/w for space so it works for me but if you're expecting to actually put 250 individual earrings in there, I don't think it's going to work.
",4
19096,"Excellent for organizing all of your earrings. I hate scrambling through a pile of earrings to find two of a kind. Now you can see every pair of earring you own and it looks really sharp too. (Warning, it is fairly large so don't expect it to look insignificant on your dresser). Now if only they had also included a section for hanging necklaces/bracelets and you have the perfect jewelry organizer!
",4
19097,"I purchased this item about a year ago and love it. It's got style, has a nice weight behind it, and holds many pairs of earrings. The only issue I have is that my long, dangly earrings definitely don't have enough room to hang here, nor do the big hoops. If you're a hoop person, consider finding an earring holder that has a bit more space between the different levels, which are about 1.25 - 1.5 inches apart.One other thing I noticed is that several of the bars have an odd number of holes in them. It's more of an A-type thing than anything else, but those extra holes go to waste for me because I don't want to hang one earring on one bar and the other earring a rung down.
",4
19098,"It's a very nice piece, although it was bigger than I expected. It's about a foot tall, and will definitely hold plenty of earrings. I needed an item like this, because my earrings end up in a pile and tangled. This is good to hold all types, hoops, studs, and dangly earrings.
",4
19122,"Got these earrings for my girlfriend, she loved them.They look awesome! Only problem so far is the backs are so small that one pulled through. Maybe need to buy a bigger backs.
",4
19134,"Ordered this as a gift and it's a pretty cute and very different item. What I'm really going to boast about, however, is the customer service. The original wouldn't open, so I emailed the company asking for any advice on how to fix it. Without any more questions or run-around, they asked me to ship it back and they'd send a replacement. Which they did in a very timely manner. I really appreciate how simple the transaction was and the speed at which they got me the replacement.I only rate the PRODUCT at 4 stars because of the fact that it needed replaced. I feel that these should be better tested when coming off the assembly line.
",4
19137,"Nice bracelet, better than i expected and it looks nice on my hand (and i have big hands, so don't worry about the size)
",4
19140,"These earrings are very pretty. Definitely a good buy for someone who loves amethyst or if you know someone who loves purple they will love these. I was worried the stones wouldn't be large - It's hard to determine size with the measurement guides shown on the site - but they are a really good size & are truly beautiful.
",4
19175,"The sterling silver mother of pearl inlay earrings are very nice, but they are smaller than I expected from looking at the picture on Amazon. They are a good bargain for the price. I will combine them with a sterling silver mother of pearl pendant I have.
",4
19177,"I was very happy with the look and quality of these earrings. They were a little smaller than I expected, but are beautiful!
",4
19179,"I'm a first time buyer of jewelry online, and overall I was satisfied. I will probably buy online again.The earrings were smaller than expected from the picture, but still a nice size.The free gift bag was cheap and I didn't use it. You get what you pay for.I paid the expedite fee to speed up the shipping, but it still took close to a week. I will keep that in mind next time.
",4
19195,"The quality is very good but size is smaller than expected. That may be just as well, you don't really want a huge case like this in your makeup area.
",4
19198,"however if you wear longer earrings than I do, they won't &#34;hang&#34;, not even on the upper row. And it's impractical for post earrings unless you have very slender fingers. Well made, and I like the see through case.
",4
19203,"I love this earring holder. It holds just the essentials that you wear regularly, without having to pull your entire jewelry box out (the one that you keep the good stuff in. Because it's clear, you can see exactly what you have and where to find exactly what you want to wear for the day. Only problem I found is that if you happen to drop something, it is a bit difficult to retrieve, but what woman doesn't have tweezers....Problem solved.I do think that given the fact the box is plastic (probably cost mfg'r $4.00) and it will eventually get scratched up no matter how well you care for it, It's a bit pricy. It really should sell for a lesser price.All in all, I'm very happy with this earring holder and would recommend to others.
",4
19208,"Nice size earring holder, and just what I wanted. But, when my order arrived one end of the acrylic holder was cracked. Not sure how this happened. But I am willing to reorder and give it another try.
",4
19222,"I'm always looking for cute earrings with screw backs. These are really adorable but, a little thing, they bend easily. The good thing is, they're easy to bend back (into place)!
",4
19226,"I bought this for my granddaughter and also one for a neighbor girl. I filled the box with small trinkets, hair ties, string bracelets, lip gloss, a few dollars and candy gold coins and treated it as a treasure chest. I saw my granddaughter's interest and excitement while going through the tiny compartments and she's only 3. Since she has shown an interest recently in treasure chests, I thought she would like this and she definitely did!
",4
19229,"It's smaller than expected but adorable. Mine also had a piece of wood broken off but all it means is that the large drawer comes all the way out instead of stopping (it doesn't look broken at all). The piece of wood had been glued on the inside (as a drawer stopper). The smaller side drawers have a metal piece that keeps it from coming all the way out, much smarter! If you buy this as a gift, I suggest you open it and remove all the little packaging pieces inside the drawers, the plastic around the horse and wind the back, (so that when the person receives it and opens it, it'll start playing and spinning without them having to wind it).All & all, glad I only paid $13., and not the full price. Check the dimensions and make sure it's what you're expecting.
",4
19232,"This held together quite well and my granddaughter loved it (even when she played a little rough, it held together!)
",4
19245,"lovely piece but not what I expected, returned item and was very easy to do so. lindsay was great. A++++
",4
19247,"Lovely piece! Purchased for 11 year old grand-daughter who dreams of traveling around the globe!Will probably replace chain, as it seems a bit heavy for a younger person. The details of the marble are intriguing.Next time I'm near Shasta, I plan to stop by the store and look at all the 'earth' products.
",4
19251,"I bought the pendant and the earrings. The detail of the maps is really nice, and knowing that is made from recycled glass is like making a statement... The chain is not good quality so i got another one. Beautiful.
",4
19255,"Nice product... I've worn them everyday since I got them. Its a little hard to tell they are a heart unless you look carefully but overall quality is very nice.
",4
19257,"I really like that the holder has a hinged cover to keep the dust off. I also like that it revolves, making it easy to see all my earrings. The unit seems to be well made.However, if you have lots of post/stud and wire/drop earrings, you may want to store them in separate holders. When I tried to store both types in one, things got awkward.You can't store anything, except post/studs, with the unit on its side (my preference, looks more organized). Otherwise, anything longer than 1/2"" gets hung-up when you try turning the revolve knob.I stood the holder vertically (knob at top). It's okay, but earrings are cluttered and you can't see some if most spaces are filled.Trying for more ""organization"" I re-spaced the earrings further apart, but that cut down on number I could store.
",4
19259,"I like the earring stand, but it is really best for stud earrings, and small ones at that. The holes are very close together so anything larger than a stud has to be spaced every other hole, and larger earrings even farther than that. But I like the quality and the looks of it. I would recommend it.
",4
19266,"As others have said, great for short earrings 1"" and under, not so much for chandelier types. Works fine standing on its end, makes it easy to find what you're looking for. Some styles that have the rigid clasps don't fit or drape well, but as long as you only have a few of those, it works just fine. I'd recommend it.
",4
19267,"First of all, this is an attractive and quality product. I think it works best for stud earrings rather than dangling. To hold studs you can stack more than one unit. Otherwise, you will probably want to stand it on end as shown. I would use a harp-style holder for dangling earrings. This unit is easy to use and compact.
",4
19273,"I really like the way this product looks. However it is a little difficult to hang the earrings.
",4
19277,"Even though the box itself is roomy, beautiful and functional, the description is incorrect. There are only two drawers, as a matter of fact it's a one rawer (bottom) divided into 2 compartments. The top section is not a drawer. It works as a usual box: the lid goes up. Although it's still very nice, it doesn't serve my particular needs: I needed exactly a unit with drawers, as I put another jewelry box on top of this one. I still decided to keep it, because I put some stuff I don't really wear much in the top section, and in a way it did solve the problem, however, I just wanted to point out that if you need it as only the drawer unit, it may not serve you well.
",4
19283,"Its good for the price and its just as the seller describe them, the colors are good and the sizes are as you can see in the picture.. No regrets.!
",4
19285,"These earrings are perfectly sized from small to large. I got the black and white set. They're really pretty with short or long hair. The only reason I am leaving a 4 star instead of 5 is because they do bend a bit and you have to be a little more careful, also some of the color coating comes off so you really have to be aware of how you take care of them. I have black hair so the black ones don't really show through my hair while the white ones are very stark. I wear the white ones with my hair down and the black ones with it up, so I always have a pair no matter how I have my hair done. I really liked that they have so many sizes, it added a nice start to my hoop collection. I always have a set in!
",4
19291,"I was really surprised at the quality of this set of silver hoop earrings, especially priced as low as they were. I tend to lose earrings but they latch securely and I've already received several comments on them. Little do they know what a deal they were!
",4
19315,"I bought these for my wife to organize a bunch of jewelry she inherited. I withheld only one star because the lids don't ""snap"" in any meaningful way. If the lids helped hold the contents in place a bit better, it would be a perfect 5 stars.
",4
19317,"I've had my jewelry in boxes as far back as I can remember, and is the reason why most of them never got worn. It was always a hassle to have to sift through them, with much of the necklaces being tangled. This completely solves this problem. Velvet fabric is a nice touch, as it's color is rich and makes the pieces stand out. The compartments are nicely sized, some smaller than others for more dainty pieces. I did mark it down one star for it's very flimsy top cover, but at least it came with one. Would have preferred a more solid plastic for added stacking stability, but so far, I am satisfied with it overall.
",4
19318,"Since this is stackable, it would be helpful if the lid sealed. Right now, the ""lid"" is actually a loose cover that easily slides off. Also, I have necklaces and earrings that match - this container doesn't lend itself to putting them together. It would be great if the manufacturer had long rows for the necklaces with little boxes at the ends for earrings. However, it has a tarnish-resistant lining, stacks neatly, is easy to use and has rows of different sizes which can handle slim chains or bulkier beads. It also comes in three colors (burgundy, blue and gray). I recommend this, particularly as an accompaniment to the earring container.
",4
19324,"I like it. I know the stretchy cord will break, they always do. Hopefully, when it does, I'll find all the pieces and restring it.
",4
19325,"This functioned just as expected. It's great to have a tray specific for rings. Would like to see Amazon carry the alternate color selections also.
",4
19343,"I enjoy this item only the corners of the star are somewhat pokey and also kind of grab on clothes. I would only recommend it on piercings that are super new and sensitive.

19412,"I knocked off a star because I never found the 24kt gold stamp. Other than that, though, these earrings are versatile--for casual or formal wear. The picture is close to what I received, but my pair has less substance where the actual leaf is. Put simply, it's not a solid leaf. The electroplating process eats most of the leaf away, leaving only the main veins and the smaller veins that feed into the main ones. The earrings are still quite pretty, though...I wear them often.

19431,"The product came quickly and was as shown. My sister loved it. How ever the shipping was way to high. It should have been shipped over night for what I paid.

19446,"I ordered my pendant from David's Jewelers but this is the same one. The pendant I recieved was proportionate to what a pendant size in relation to a chain should look like. It looks good with my 3.0 mm 24 inch chain. Unless you are giving the 1/2 inch size to a baby, small child, or as a charm for a bracelet, don't bother ordering that one. Shipping took a very long time but customer service was top notch and the end product was worth the wait.

Hurry up and buy this cause there's only like 5 left and they are millions of fat kids. That's a huge ratio difference there. You like, you buy, you Italy. I'm Italy. We are Italy.

I have gotten used to the size. 2"" on a ruler looks smaller than these do on your ear. Very well made - should last for a long time (some silver is too soft & the posts break). Overall, I'm glad to have them.

19667,"The heavier guage wire and leverbacks make these earrings feel very substantial and well made. The garnets have a very clear red tone (sometimes garnets are so black that you can't tell they're garnets). The wires are a bit long in the front, making the stone angle downward somewhat.

19674,"My girlfriend and I got a matching pair of these when we started dating a year and a half ago. They've held up beautifully despite their daily beatings over the last 500+ days. Definitely Solid. And I / we LOVE the wave design - it's clean, pretty, and I really like the subtle clever use of negative space for the opposing waves. Like the ying and the yang.My only complaint is the welding on the outer spinning band. You can't see it in the picture, but where the outer-band is welded together, there's about 3mm of welding material, covering an entire wave, and it looks a mess. Fortunately, it's smooth and doesn't really bother me that much. I'm spinning it around most of the time anyway. And it's not like this is a Tiffany's ring -- for the price, it's really hard to complain.
",4
19678,"I bought it and immediately loved it. Some black funk came off for a few days but other than that it wears beautifully. I get lots of compliments too. I wear it all the time but need to be mindful with certain things while wearing it....like playing in the sand, working in clay, anything that can get in between the two pieces. What ever gets in it works its way out after you spin it repeatedly.

19707,"Perfect ear cuff. Slightly larger than expected, but that allows the details to be seen from a distance.It's very solid, but not overly heavy the way that some ornamental pieces can be.One complaint: there's very little play in the legs that form the actual cuff, so it is difficult to adjust. It seems specifically designed to be worn over the central cartilage where adjusting isn't really necessary though, so that's not a huge deal.

19722,"They are small but just right when you want to wear studs. The color is a little darker than the picture but still very nice. Have gotten many compliments when using them. Over all a very happy purchase.
",4
19727,"I got these as a St. Pats gift for my daughter so she hasn't received them yet. I don't think they are the bright green as shown but are still quite nice and worth the special daily price I paid. They will give a subtle color punch and that's what I was looking for since she does not wear heavy or large jewelry.
",4
19737,"I must admit I was somewhat leery about purchasing these earrings, sight unseen. However, I was very pleased when the package arrived & I opened the box. The shade of green was exactly what I was hoping it would be; a nice medium shade with no inclusions.The earrings are bright, clear & perfectly matched. I would have rated the earrings 5 Stars if the gold through the ear had been a little more substantial.

19747,"Due to a jewelry allergy, it is hard to find earrings that are reasonably priced. I was very pleased with the price of these earrings & they are really pretty.

19748,"My husband just gave me a pair of these garnet earrings as an early Valentine's Day gift. They're well made, and the stones are beautiful with a very nice color. I had already read that the post was on the top, so when I got these it wasn't a surprise, but had the post been in the center, I'd have given the earrings 5 stars instead of 4. Still pretty nice - I'm wearing them right now.
",4
19749,"I like wearing these earrings - they are simple and classic in design and since I require gold posts (get knots in my ears with other types of metal posts), the challenge is being able to afford multiple pairs and colors. For $33, I am quite satisfied with these even though the stones are not as bright and darkly colored as the picture indicates (hence four stars for this truth in advertising issue). The posts are sturdy and backs fit securely. Peridote stones are translucent and free of visible inclusions. The color goes nicely with my spring wardrobe. Appropriate for all ages. I'd highly recommend them.

19754,"I think these are excellent, they look good and the color is a deep rich red.
",4
19759,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these 14k Yellow Gold Four Prong 7x5mm Oval Garnet Stud Earrings. The color of the stone is a true Garnet color (reddish-brown). I was, however, a little disappointed that the gold post was not centered and the backs were quite small. The price was reasonable and the size of the stone was perfect. I am glad I made this purchase.
",4
19760,"Bright, clear stone. These are small earrings, not too flashy. Lightweight, comfortable setting, easy to wear.
",4
19767,"There is no question that the stones in these earrings, for $19.99 (plus super saver status) are first rate in color and size. The reason these earrings don't get five stars from me is that they come with pretty small earring backs. For the size of the earrings, not to mention that the posts are not centered, the backs are too small. Considering that they are rated as being worth $75, they should have larger backs.
",4
19770,"Size looks little small But the stone quality is good.Mounting is good.I lost one back when I was brushing my hair, But was able to find it after 6 hours. I wish the backs are made some what more sturdy.

19803,"My husband gave me an amethist pendant 2 years ago as a gift. Since then, I have been searching for matching earrings. My son gave me an Amazon gift card for Mother's Day this year and I found these earrings. They are beautiful and now I have a complete set!
",4
19811,"These were a Mother's Day gift for my mom. Her birthday is not in February, but these were so pretty that I knew she would appreciate them anyway. The color is beautiful and a deep, rich purple. They were well set in the prongs and not loose as sometimes stones are. Very cute and look nice. These are just the right size and do not overpower the ears.
",4
19818,"These earrings are smaller than I expected them to be and do not show at all in my ears. Maybe it's because my hair is brown plus their size...?The gold in them is substantial and the stones are a reasonable quality for the price. If you purchase these and prefer earrings that are femnine and delicate, you'll enjoy owning these and they are worth the price of $39

19827,"These were a Christmas gift for my girlfriend;she wears a lot of beige and browns and the color is a beautiful ""smoky quartz"".They are a little small but very nicequality and unusual color.
",4
19828,"I like the earrings themselves - extremely pretty - they are what I expected. The only thing that disappointed me was the size of the backings...really SMALL and which I had to replace. I'm sure I would lose these earrings if I did not replace them -- they should have come with bigger, tighter backings.

19841,"These earrings are exactly the color as pictured, a little lighter blue then the earrings I lost that these are replacing, but true to the image on Amazon. They are 6mmx4mm, so before ordering check out a ruler and see if that size works for you. For me it was just right.My only criticism is that I wish the prongs had a little more bend around the stones. It seems as if the prongs are straight and I'm wondering if one day I might find a stone missing...but so far so good.

19845,"Negatives:Small, if that's not what you are looking for(most women now days seem to prefer the larger dangly type).Positives:Very pretty and well priced.Recommend it?Once again if small is what you are looking for this is it. Well of course you say, they are stud earrings after all. I'm telling you they are small, even for average stud type earrings, but they are pretty and my wife likes them.

19849,"They were as described and the price was quite good. I really like them, but the butterfly backs could be just a little bit bigger. (The older we get, the less nimble our fingers become...)

19859,"This bracelet was on sale when I bought it, and a bargain, in my opinion. The ultimate recipient likes a small bracelet and thinks it is beautiful, but the little U lock on the clasp broke when she first wore it. It cost $25.00 to get it fixed. Compared to the cost of shipping and insurance to return it, it was a small price for a stronger clasp. The first estimate I got was $40, in which case I would have returned it.Now, all is well in the world with this bracelet, but it turned out to cost much more than I thought. She found a beautiful sapphire bracelet on sale at the jewelry store when we went to pick this one up after the repair.

19901,"I got this necklace as a gift and I love it. The blue topaz is amazing, eye catching, and very large!!! The cut of the topaz makes it shine in the most amazing way. The only problem with the necklace is the chain is a bit too thin and short for this pendant. In fact I've had to put it on an entirely different chain that is longer and thicker. The chain that comes with the pendant is very thin and inspite it's beauty I thought it wasn't enough to keep the very heavy pendant from easily breaking loose.

19907,"I got these earrings in 2006, so it's been 4 years now. They're still holding up, still pretty and shiny. The silver is a bit tarnished, but when I put them on it's not really noticeable. They're very gorgeous and you can see them from far away. I just wish the little long bar wasn't so flimsy though.

",4
19924,"I purchased this bracelet for myself. It's very shiny. Very pleased though. It is worth more than what you pay for it. I plan to add a few charms later, but for now, it is nice enough to wear without. Really pleased. This is a good buy.
",4
19977,"The design of this bracelet is lovely. The recipient of the gift loves it. The bracelet I received does not look exactly like the one pictured as the copper-look of the pearls is more frosted than metallic. This gives the bracelet a lighter look than anticipated, but it is a great piece to add to anyone's collection.

20006,"The Dahlia Silky Embroidered Brocade Jewelry Travel Organizer is well constructed, being constructed of very soft and silky material, and very beautifully embroidered. It has one full length unzippered compartment, one half length zippered compartment, two 1/4 length zippered compartments, and a ring ""finger"" which holds rings securely. All zippered compartments seem secure.This is a fine product as is, and well worth the $15-$22 each. But my wife has a couple of complaints/suggestions:There is no way, as in some other jewelry travel cases, to hold fine-chained necklaces with pendants except in a zippered compartment, out of which they come tangled and knotted.Likewise for earrings w/ posts, there is no way to store them except loosely in a zippered compartment, in which they can slosh back and forth during travel, and out of which it is more time-consuming to select the specific earrings desired to be worn. My wife doesn't like her earrings grinding against one another during travel.If the manufacturer could put a small strip of thin plastic, w/10 pre-punched holes in it for earrings with posts, to hold five sets, in one of the small zippered compartments, (I made one out of cardboard) then posted earrings could be stored much more safely and securely, and specific earrings can be selected more easily.In my opinion, if Dahlia can design these additional features into their product then it will become very close to being the almost perfect jewelry travel wrap, for posted earrings, rings and necklaces w/ pendants.Hal Dekker

20007,"I got this as a Chrismas gift for a friend from her wish list, so she really picked it out. She does a lot of traveling and says that she loves it. The only thing she felt could use improvement was that the necklace pocket only worked for short chains, but that doesn't make her love it any less. If I were still a traveler (those days are behind me), I'd consider one for myself.
",4
20020,"Smaller than I thought and not the color I thought I was getting (yellowish- not white like in the photo), but it will work. I'll probably eventually need 2 of these. I'm also disapointed there is not an area for those delicate necklace chains to be stored in with out getting into impossible tangles.

20022,"The quality of this jewelry bag is superb. I didn't realize however that I picked ""Champagne Gold"" color because the picture is more of an ivory color. However, still happy with the product over all. Very pretty!

20027,"My wife was looking for a tote of some sort for her jewelry when she goes on cruises. The travel pouch is every bit as ornate and rich looking as the picture. I bought it for her as a xmas gift and she was very surprised and happy at the beauty and overall designed functionality of the pouch not knowing the value.
",4
20041,"I really like this product, I could fit a lot of jewelry inside, the only problem I had was with the button for the ring tube coming loose on my trip and having to re-sew that when I got back home. Otherwise, it packed great and kept the jewelry from tangling.

Was pleasantly surprise that it was very pretty and well made CZ bracelet and worthy of wearing on my wedding. Has a couple of slide in and latch clasps which makes the bracelet feel weighty and ""expensive"".

20177,"I am very happy with this bracelet. The S design is artfully designed and not cheap looking. I bought it as a bum-around bracelet. Something i can wear during the day time, while doing everyday chores or going somewhere like the beach. The stainless steel has a shinny look like chrome. It does not seem to be easily scratched or dulled. The latch is very strong and blends in with the S design of the bracelet. PS you can wear it to some where nice at night too.

20201,"Cute earrings, but I expected them to be a little better quality. They are very thin and are obviously not top quality sterling silver.
",4
20206,"I ordered this ring as a temporary wedding band to go with my engagement ring until we can afford the ring I plan on getting later... It does look great and if you aren't studying it I think it looks real, however if you look there are gaps between each stone which makes it not look that great. Also, I've been wearing it for at least a month nonstop and it does look a little dinged and dented but it's not noticeable at all unless you're up close. Overall, for the price it's a lot better than I was expecting.
",4
20227,"Love, love, love this ring! I bought it as replacement wedding band and the fit is perfect and the stones are beautiful. No complaints here! The stones are the perfect size; you can't tell if it is fake or not. I am impressed with the quality of the ring for the low price. It is comfortable to wear. The band is thicker than I thought it would be, but it ended up looking really good with the princess cut sterling silver ring I bought from the same seller.
",4
20231,"The quality and construction of this ring is extremely nice. I was a little disappointed in the size of the ring...thinking that it would be wider...but it's still lovely and it's a nice alternative band to wear with my ""bling"" engagement ring.

",4
20239,"Much better than I had expected. I don't wear it continuously, but it's very shiny and sparkly. It's nice alone or with other rings.
",4
20245,"I love it, but it's a little bulky on your finger. Once you get used to it, it's great. The only down side is that I've had it for two months and it is already showing some wear and tear. But, I'd definitely buy it again.
",4
20250,"I had bought this for my girlfriend as a promise ring, and she just loves it! the only down side is the size's for this ring are limited, but still a great ring for a great price.

20268,"My daughter loves dragonflies. When she opened the boxcontaining the earrings, she was tickled! She lovesdangly earrings, so these were a perfect match for her!
",4
20269,"I really like these earrings! Pretty and delicate, they're very lightweight - you feel like you're not wearing anything at all. Only problem is they irritate my sensitive ears... they must only be sterling plated, because pure sterling has never given me a problem before.

20274,"I was, like most people perhaps, a little apprehensive about ordering jewelry online. I read the reviews from other's who purchased this ring and felt a little more confident.I am happy to say that I am very pleased with the total experience from this vendor. The ring isn't ""cheap"" looking at all. It has some substance to it and the stones they used are very nice indeed. It comes in it's own wooden gift box, inside a plain white box, inside a nice blue velvet bag, nice. It's a beautiful piece of jewelry at a very reasonable price.The staff at finejewelers were easy to work with. Communication was great and the turn around time was excellent! I read that they will call you but I emailed them first. They returned my email very promptly to confirm my stone choices and emailed me when my order shipped. Excellent. Thank you FineJewelers!

20333,"My friend just loved it when she got it and the ring is even prettier than it was online. Very Very satisfied and would definately order from here again. and plan to!
",4
20376,"I too was skeptical about purchasing jewelry online. However, I also struggled to find a substantial mothers ring anywhere at a reasonable price so I gave it a shot. The ordering process was easy and the ring came very quickly. In general, I am happy with the experience. The stones are a nice size. One of the stones is set crooked so I will have to have it re-set since I don't have time to send it back to the company before I give it to my mom for her birthday. Overall, I don't think you can do better at this price point for the size of the stones, the fact that they are genuine, and that it has real diamonds.
",4
20387,"Its really nice product. The only down side is the sponge keep falling off the slot. But the leather case is very well done.
",4
20388,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he really liked it! This is a great starting point for a first time humidor user. The construction was pretty good but of course is is not the highest quality. I didn't buy this with the intention of use for travel just to get my husband to start learning about how to properly use humidors. It was perfect for that and he still uses it today and one day we'll invest in a larger desktop version.
",4
20404,"I love cats, and my favorite color is purple so I was happy to find these - and they were reasonably priced.It would have been soooo much better if the kittens on the earrings were made to face each other (one facing left, one facing right) rather than both pointed in the same direction. I like symmetry and balance. What you don't see in the item photo is the hole in the center of the Amethyst Stone. One of the cats almost covers it, the other is farther up on the stone, making the hole more noticeable. If you are particular about things like this, you may want to write and ask for a better photo of the earrings that will be shipped.I took some digital photos to show the difference, but so far I don't see them posted.

20405,"I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she absolutely loves it! The quality and detail on the bracelet are excellent..
",4
20423,"I've had it for over a month and I still am in love with it! the stones are beautiful color, the silver still looks great. I normally wear a size 7 and this one was a little big so it digs into another finger since it moves too much. But it looks so real. Very glad I choose this one.
",4
20426,"the ring is very nice. The emerald is a nice rich color and the side CZ's are bright. Nice weight.
",4
20427,"I just got the ring today and put it on right away. The emerald is bigger than I thought it would be but I really like the look of the ring. I even got a compliment on it today. It has pretty diamonds accenting the band that I didn't notice in the picture. Overall I am happy with the purchase am just worried about the other review with the scratching. Will update if it becomes a problem.
",4
20428,"It is a nice pendant i wish the chain could have been a little bit thicker
",4
20440,"Just like the title, just that i wish i could move the main part because the necklace can look crocked easily if its not hooked in the right hole...but great investment and very lovely box
",4
20442,"I am a very hard person to buy jewelry for, but even my pickiness couldn't mar my opinion when I got this necklace as a gift. It is very light and can be fairly casual or formal depending on your needs, and the adjustable length makes it easier to tailor to your desired neckline. My only problem, as is also described by the other reviewer, is that it is easy for the necklace to migrate a little to one side without you noticing, and because it is not a pendant sliding on a chain, it can't right itself. The adjustable chain also means there is no definitive way to straighten it by touch so you need a mirror. Other than that, though, it's an awesome piece of jewelry and simply very pretty.
",4
20443,"Great unique style, looks even better than on the picture. Stands out but is not overwhelming. Quality product.Why four stars? As for a choker it's on a longer side. You may want to check how 17.9 inches compares to your collar size.
",4
20467,"Much nicer than I expected. It is nicely made and quite large. It is polished to a high shine and has a delicate lacy appearance when on the wrist. It is my boldest bracelet to date and I am glad that I added it to my jewelry wardrobe.
",4
20469,"The pearls in my pair of earrings were not as pink as they appear in the picture. Mine are more of a champagne peach color, although they look pinker if you wear a pink shirt with them. But I like them anyway because they turned out to be an exact match to a pendant I already own. The Akoya pearls in these earrings are very good quality, round and perfectly matched as to size and color. The clutchbacks are not teeny tiny, but are big enough to grasp easily.
",4
20471,"These bracelets are beautiful and the colors are just perfect. The only problem I have with them is that they are very small. I had to give them to my daughter because they would not fit me and even she said they seemed very snug. I would still recommend they but with caution.
",4
20495,"I bought these for a Christmas present and almost kept them for myself. The only thing that would have improved this purchase was if it had come in a gift box (they came in a small Ziploc bag).

20519,"good quality for the &#34;sale&#34; price. the claps is very sturdy. I added a &#34;safety chain&#34; and now i am sure to wear this bracelet for years to come.
",4
20520,"This bracelet has a nice clasp; says the jeweler. It came faster than I anticipated and it is having 13 charms soldered on it right now. I can hardly wait to wear it.
",4
20524,"I (a 63-year-old male) just bought this charm bracelet as a gift. It looks more substantial in the photo. This a bright, dainty bracelet. It looks very good, but I'm not really sure that the links are large enough to accept charms. It is exactly 8"" in length, counting the connectors (clasps) on each end. It looks very good. I suspect that people with more experience buying jewelry, especially women, will love it. If it is durable, it is a bargain. The only real negative is that the shipping is about twice what it should be: the item is mailed in an envelope.
",4
20554,"These came in great condition and with a nice box to store them in! They are very pretty, but if you don't like heavy earrings these won't be for you!
",4
20558,"I really ordered these to complete the set because I previously ordered the matching necklace and bracelet. Their nice looking if you like dangling big earrings
",4
20563,"I love this bracelet, it's versatile and elegant,I can wear it with everything,jeans or dress. I do have a problem with the clasp though,difficult to close by myself.One more link would have made it perfect,since it's tight around my wrist.I like my bracelets to move up and down my arm.I'm going to replace the clasp with a larger one.

20623,"The seller was great and the craftmanship of figurine excellent. However, couldn't tell from picture that has stones in collar--would have preferred without or at least choice of color. (Figurine is about 2 inches tall)
",4
20628,"I love my 3 bangle bracelet set and have had so many compliments when wearing them along with my silvertone watch. I like the effect of the three being connected together yet giving the effect of being three separate bangles. The set is a lot lighter weight than I had expected, but certainly a very good value.

20655,"I was looking for simple sterling silver hoops to pair with some flashier necklaces i have and these were perfect. The posts on the hoops are bigger than i expected but i had no problems getting them through my holes. They are hollow inside like the previous review said but they still have a heavy weight even for being hollow. Over all these are very nice earings for the price and quite elegant when paired with flashier pieces.
",4
20656,"These earrings are a great find. They are made of .925 sterling silver, which is the same quality of Tiffany's. The only downside is they are not solid. If you look inside the hoop, it is hollow. The earrings come in a blue velvet bag and gift box. Eve's Addiction also included a pair of CZ princess cut earrings since my purchase was more than $75 and I received free shipping. For $28, I am happy with my purchase!
",4
20666,"I agree with the other reviewer, the locket is beautiful but the necklace is really thin. It ripped two weeks after I got it and I had to replace it with another thicker chain. But other than that, it's a very nice locket that can hold two pictures and would look very nice if it were engraved.

20676,"Got this for my kids so they could give it to my wife as a present at Christmas time. They put their pictures inside and wrapped it up for her and put it under the tree. My wife opened it up and she could just stare at it and the pictures inside. She absolutely loved it and it made the morning at Christmas. This is a great present and I couldn't of asked for a better present for my kids to give to their mom.

20688,"I have ordered may rigs from amazon and I finally wanted somethig simple and not gaudy. I saw this and thought it was perfect because it isnt just a simple plai band or a band covered with gems, its the best of both worlds. I received it today and I must say it is beautiful. Its dainty, not too thick, and it is so comfortable. it has just enough sparkle to garner a second peek from passerbys and I can't stop smiling whe I look at it. This is the perfect wedding band for me. Just enough design but still elegant.

20695,"Its a nice ring. A bit odd shaped, takes a minute to get use to and the diamonds are smaller than they appear, but good for the price.

20726,"I am wearing this pendant as I am writing this. It's very very pretty, only trouble I had was that some of the backing flaked off so it is clear in a spot or two. For the money it is quite eye catching. It's not a forever piece but so pretty in the sun!

20741,"I've been wanting a simple little locket for some time and this fits the bill. It's a nice, shiny silver with a decent chain. Good clasp and opens easily. There are small plastic heart pieces on the inside that aren't really cut that well so they're not practical to use to cover the picture inside. I'm not sure you could fit it in over the picture anyway, just not enough room.Because of it's smaller size, I'll probably buy a bigger one at some point and give this one to my daughter as I think it work quite well as a child sized locket. I'm happy with the $14 I paid for it, but probably wouldn't pay much more.

20756,"I got this bracelet for my three month old daughter! As soon as I got it, I put it on, it was PERFECT. It's beautiful, fits great, with room to grow. Love the color too! Well crafted, don't feel worried it might break. The only down side, I think, is the clasps is a little hard to do, especially with a wiggling newborn. But once I practiced more, I can get it on rather quickly now. All and all this bracelet looks more than it costs, and I don't feel guilty for buying something she can't wear for too long, when I didn't pay much. Other bracelets, like this one, cost almost 50 dollars! I plan on keeping it safe, so she can pass it down to hopefully her little girl :)

20804,"I LOVE this ring! Since I got this ring, as a picked gift for Saint Patrick's day, I have not taken it off. It is very conformable, I can't even feel it. I certainly got my moneys worth. The picture has a little more detail in the hands than mine does. The sizes are a little off, I got mine smaller than what the Amazon ring fit chart suggested. During the day I will look down and it always catches my graze, often I have trouble looking away.

20832,"I purchased this piece to accompany a sun pendant that I also purchased from this website. The pieces are similar in design, and the little indentations around the edges add more character to the piece. Same as the sun piece, the chain provided is way to small. Only reason I took off a star is because this piece looks a bit rustic. Since I wanted it as an accompaniment to the sun charm I was hoping the detail was matching on both. But overall, very beautiful.

20896,"I bought 3 pairs of these nose studs because I actually purchased them for my ears. I have 3 holes in each ear and they are the perfect size if you are going for a classic look. They are very small, but not so small that they fall out. This is actually the second set that I've purchased from Sabrina Silver. I purchased the first set about a year ago and I wore them every day. The only time I took them out was to clean them. They held up pretty well, but I use rubbing alcohol to clean them and it wears the silver finish off after a while. They are not solid sterling. They must just be coated with sterling. Overall, they are a good value for the price. I am very satisfied.

20965,"I had left a review for this product, not to long ago, that was not the best. I had sent an email to the company stating that the hygrometer was not working properly and I never received a response. They called me eventually because of the bad review I had left and said that they had never received the email I sent. I am choosing to re-review this product now because, granted email is not always reliable and now that I have had this humidor for a length of time my feelings have changed. I would like now to state that this product is a very reliable piece. It has been almost a month since the last time I recharged the humidification devises and they are completely dried out. This is a good thing as far as I am concerned because, I am having a problem still with keeping the humidity lower at the proper level. This tells me that this humidor has an excellent seal. My hygrometer still does not work (the one that came with the humidor; I have since bought a digital one) but the company did offer to replace it for me when I had talked to them. I did not have it replaced because with the size of the humidor it took almost 2 or 3 weeks to season it and prepare it for cigar storage, so I declined their offer. As far recommending this product, I would definitely recommend it. I am not to partial to the pull out shelf but it doe

20970,"I just needed a cord to replace on my favorite necklace. I used to use a thin chain, which was pretty annoying.This just arrived and it gets the job done. Seems sturdy enough for a necklace. The clasp is very thin and delicate, but as with all necklaces, as long as you don't reef on it it won't break. The cord is somewhat thick so I can see this not fitting some very fine/small things. For me it works very well, delivered quickly and in perfect condition. It is quite stretchy as well so I have a hard time imagining this breaking anythime soon. The rubber it is made out of is quite smooth and comfortable so I hardly even notice it.The only bad thing I can say about this, and it is a very minor complaint: The clasp, being small and delicate is REALLY small. A gentleman like myself with man-hands could find it difficult to attatch/re-attatch. Since I rarely take it off I don't have to worry about it, but for those of you who have dextrous tinkering hands this will not be a problem.I'll see how long it lasts as I've only had it a few days, but seems quite good so far.

Very versatile: I wear to work frequently and have been able to wear it with dressier clothes as well. The chain that comes with it is very nice although I would have liked it a little longer. Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase.

21148,"My husband bought this necklace for me last Christmas, and I still love wearing it. I wear it at least twice a week. People frequently comment on how much they like it. The only thing I don't like about it is that the chain sometimes tangles my hair around it at the nape of my neck--ouch! But that is a small price to pay for how nice it looks.

21221,"The box is very elegant and sturdy. It has a magnetic snap that keeps it together and has multiple compartments for rings and/or cufflinks. It only has two watch compartments however.

21259,"As silly as it may sound, I got this ring because I was sick of guys hitting on me at work, and I needed something to show them that says, ""See, I'm in a relationship! Now back off!"" From the reviews I expected something good, but when I got it in the mail this morning I was really happily surprised. I got compliments all day at work and people kept asking if it was real. The best things about this ring are that it's low profile so it doesn't get stuck on everything, it is comfortable to wear, and it looks real! Only con is that I ordered a size five, I'm always a size 5, and it was just a bit too small. But that's easy enough to get fixed.So all in all, I love the ring, and I suggest it to anyone.

21307,"I really liked this piece. The detail on the dragon is really good, and it is slightly heavy so you would need to put in a thicker chain. The only thing I found off about it was that the glass sphere was darker than expected against skin. It only looks the red in the photo when light shines through it. Anywhere else it is almost black with a slight red tint. Other than that I love it. Got lots of notice wearing it.

My boyfriend got this necklace for me and upon noticing the weakness of the chain he gave me a separate chain with it. I really like the pendent a lot though, and would have given 5 stars if the chain had been better.

21362,"I really like this stud. It's cute and you can see it. And the shipping was lightening fast. I was shocked it got here before Christmas and I can show it off. Beware of the size if you are used to a smaller size. This one is closer to the normal piercing size than the cheepies you buy in stores, so it's a little bigger and not as comfortable when first put in your nose. But after a few minutes it's fine and looks good too.

",4
21418,"First let me say that the quality of this bracelet is fantastic and that it is a very strong material that does not fade or bend easily. It has a nice little ""snap"" feature that is strong enough to keep the bracelet from accidentally opening, but still is fairly easy to get off.That being said, I am a tall girl and have larger wrists. My wrist is 6 1/2"" inches around at the widest point (over the bone). So I do wish the bracelet was just a LITTLE bit bigger. I can wear the bracelet comfortably, but it is not a ""bangle"" meaning it does not slide up and down my arm at all. I am still giving it 4 stars because it is such a beautiful quality piece of jewelry and would fit as a bangle on smaller, petite wrists (teens, etc.).The bracelet could probably be engraved easily on the inside or outside due to the design and material. It should be noted that the entire bracelet is polished (not matte). In the photo, it appears to be brushed aluminum look. In fact, the entire bracelet is polished surgical steel. The bracelet is also solid metal (not hollow or plated).I am sure this bracelet will last me a long time and so far it has no scratches and wears nicely. The squared-off shape makes it more modern. I highly recommend.
",4
21421,"The bracelet is nice and solid. It comes in a cheap plastic bag and at first I was disappointed. When taking the bracelet out though, it is well made and if it holds up, might be worth the price. Other than having to repackage it to give it as a gift, I am happy with it.

",4
21438,"These are really cute earrings, but I was expecting the backside of the earring to be solid; it's not. I guess that makes the earrings lighter in weight, but it also makes them seem cheaper in quality. Still, I'd buy them again.

21446,"I like these earrings a lot. They are a little over an inch long and look great with my long straight dark brown hair. The photo looks like there is a little black in them but mostly they look pure shiny sterling silver, which I didn't like at first but they looked awesome with jeans. The merquesite is so small they hardly even catch the light.

21456,"These are a very nice little pair of silver peace sign earrings. I purchased them a few days ago along with another pair of earrings, and while both pairs are small, having them sent in the same box, in the same envelope, but having to pay shipping on both as separate items I feel is a bit much, so be warned. The size is nice, about the size of a pinky fingernail, and I am not allergic to them, even better ! So, four stars out of five, the knockoff being the slightly expensive shipping. I will still get things, as there's some WL items yet, but now I'm more the wiser.Sabby, combine shipping if you're going to combine packaging.

I have lost the back of my earrings several times before even with longer pole, so losing it this time is not a surprise to me.

21536,"Love them!Just what I like in a stone - clear enough to see the color vividly, but the emerald cut makes lots of sparkle, and, it prevents you from seeing all the way through the stone - which gives the impression of looking into deep, deep water - lovely.The earrings are a bit on the heavy side and hang down so they can't be seen. I used bullet clutch earring backs to prop them up so I could see the stones. (Amazon has bullet clutch backs - they make lots of earrings look better by propping them up nicely).The picture is accurate - they are amethyst not blue topaz.

21537,"My roommate got this for his girlfriend, and after examining his girlfriend's ears, I have decided that these earrings are great for the price. Not something you want to give your wife, but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young (or old) girlfriend with an entry-level ""nice"" gift. They are a decent size, and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance. Recommended.

21538,"Before you get these earrings, please read more about diamonds. 1/3 cttw is the total carat weight of these earrings, so they ARE small.

I prefer small but real diamonds over large CZ, so it is a matter of preference. These are starter diamonds for people that want to wear real diamonds without breaking the bank. I am pleased with them. My only complaint is that these earrings did not come with a certificate of authenticity. If they were not sold by Amazon, probably I would have returned them just for that reason.

21540,"These are pretty little earrings but the backs are loose. I lost one of them due to this and would recommend getting tighter backs.
",4
21542,"My wife say these are nice diamond earrings for the price, but she did not give them 5 stars because the low quality of the ""friction-back closure"". It broke after the second day using them (was too thin and weak).
",4
21561,"I've had this belly button ring for over a few months now and I still love it. The quality is great. It looks just as it does in the photo.
",4
21563,"but also very dainty. I am surprised anyone would make jewelry on a chain as tiny as this one, but it is a very pretty necklace. Just tiny.
",4
21581,"I love these earrings. They look awesome with my long chestnut hair and the marquesite sparkles just enough to catch the light now and then. But they are a bit on the heavy side; I almost returned them but in the end I couldn't part with them. That said, I haven't actually had an occasion to wear them yet... very dressy jeans and with heels kind of look I think.
",4
21592,"the item was in great shape. the material is very good, but it is much smaller than what it appears to be.
",4
21597,"These are nice earrings and are exactly as shown. Something to have around when you feel like a change from your everyday silver hoops or silver ball posts. The 12mm is very good size not to small and not too big.
",4
21610,"I've had mine for about 6 months and although they seem to be not as silver (a little tarnished) as they were when first purchased, I like wear these to work from time to time. I need to clean them to bring the shine back.
",4
21613,"Good for what I paid. I actually ended up taking the jewel balls and putting on previous ring because I didn't like the curve of this one.
",4
21614,"Nice earrings at great price. Not as round as the white ones, but nice lavender, silvery color. Came in pretty green jewelry pouch.
",4
21615,"I received these earrings as a gift by purchasing and reviewing a more expensive pair of earrings. They are a lovely size and the color match is reasonably close for such an inexpensive pair of earrings. Small and simple enough for every day,they can still add a nice touch to going out for the evening after work.
",4
21626,"I originally bought this ring about 13years ago. It sentimentally signifies my family. When one of the bands broke I needed to replace it. I love that the sizes are variant and I could wear it on a bigger finger than I had previously, but the bands are a bit thinner than I had thought. Ultimately ~ worth the money.
",4
21628,"Nice quality, but hoped that the individual rings would be a bit wider. Fit was good and true to size.
",4
21631,"I ordered a 7, because that's what size she wears. I wish I had ordered a 6.5 or 6. It wasn't THAT big...but I wish it had been a bit smaller. Otherwise it was great!
",4
21637,"I just received mine in the mail yesterday (it's going to be my wedding ring). It's very pretty - the etching is quite nice, and the ring hardly weighs anything (titanium does that!). The item photo is true to color - it's darker than a silver ring, and with the brushed finish it doesn't shine, making it also seem a little darker. It's also a bit wider and thicker than I was expecting, but I think I can get used to it easily (guess I'm used to wearing thinner rings on that finger). Because of that, it feels a little bulkier than rings I'm used to. The edges aren't beveled, but they aren't sharp.Overall I'm very pleased with it, and the seller sent it extremely quickly!
",4
21668,"I received exactly what was described! Thank you!
",4
21673,"She loves then and thats all that really matters. they look good. and i was the hero.
",4
21682,"Nice medium-weight ring with a decent sized Sapphire. The stone is a lighter color blue, but is attractive. Excellent buy at these prices.
",4
21686,"My wife loves the ring. She picked it out. I actually purchased 2 of these with different stones. The quality is comparable to similar looking rings in the $100 range. Good choice for a teen/young adult on a budget to get for his girlfriend.The ring is kinda on the thick side giving a somewhat less dainty or feminine look to it and it has a bit of a dull/unpolished look. If you take it to a jeweler you should be able to get a shine buffed into it; but hey you can't complain for less than $20 and if she likes it that's all that really matters :)
",4
21690,"the ring is beautiful. got it within 3 days. the only thing is the stone is a little darker than in the photo of it, but its still beautiful. i wear it everyday and it has not tarnished at all. would definitely buy from seller again!
",4
21691,"I love this ring. It's true that the stone is a little darker than anticipated, but other than that, it's flawless. I have read others reviews on how these rings turn your finger green, but I have brought three rings from silver insanity and that has never happened to me. I would strongly recommend this line.
",4
21695,"The ring was just as pictured. I ordered the wrong size, but it was exchanged in a timely manner. Would order again.
",4
21702,"I purchased the ring for my little girls 6th Birthday. She loves sapphires, but at her age didn't want to get an expensive ring. The ring was perfect, stone was clear and reasonably priced.
",4
21706,"Fun jewelry - holding up well over time, definatly worth the small cost of the product.
",4
21719,"I originally bought this ring for my niece when she turned 12 and she wore it everyday. It held up beautifully during all the normal rough and tumble play for the last 4 years. I'm buying her a new one only because she lost it while swimming and is heartbroken. I highly recommend this as a first ring.
",4
21720,"I have had this ring for 4 years now, and i've worn it almost every single day of that time, and it still looks amazing! I love this ring and its totally worth the money.
",4
21745,"I got this ring as a Christmas present for my daughter; she liked it. The ring ran true to size, and the worksmanship, while not of craftsman quality, was acceptable. It was a good buy.
",4
21750,"I really do love this ring. I wear it every day! One comment on here (by someone with ""boss"" in their username?) said that theirs wasn't as dark as the pic showed. Mine was almost exactly the same color, and I'm very happy with it.I don't know if it's something with the acidity of my skin or the quality of the jewelry I have, but my jewelry always turns my skin green... and, unfortunately, this ring was no exception until I put a coat of clear nail polish on the silver part of it. I believe another review said that it DIDN'T change their skin color, so maybe it IS just me.My favorite colors are sapphire blue and silver, and I absolutely love the Trinity symbol of the ring, so this really is a gorgeous ring to me.Update: About 5 months later, the bottom of the ring started wearing thin - the metal is thinning out. I don't dare wear it anymore except for special occasions, and that makes me sad. I loved the ring!
",4
21752,"beautiful ring. It was just the right size and color. I recieved my shipment in a speedy fashion, I would recommend this item and provider to friends.
",4
21754,"I have had some less than satisfactory experiences recently buying offline but I was very satisfied with this ring. It is shiny and the stone is very pretty. Someone wrote a review that the stone was light blue but it is not. The stone is a dark blue, just as it is pictured. I wear this ring often.
",4
21756,"The sapphire is a lot paler than what the picture shows. In fact it looks more like glass than I would have liked. But the price and fit was right, and I wasn't expecting it to look like a $1,000 ring, so overall I was satisfied.
",4
21761,"Fast shipping. The silver was polished to a nice shine, but the stone was a little darker than I would have expected (even darker than the picture). It's more of a midnight blue/almost black in most lights. Not sure if the stone is really genuine or not. One of these days I'll get around to taking it somewhere and having it checked out. Assuming it checks out though, this is a beautiful ring.
",4
21765,"I got this ring to replace my engagement ring (my son was born in September, so sapphire is his birthstone). I am extremely pleased with this ring. The picture is accurate (the color in particular!), and it is sized correctly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who was looking for a simple, pretty sapphire ring!
",4
21768,"I love this ring, it is very pretty. The extended sizes are outstanding. If it is in fact a genuine sapphire for this price it can only be a lab grown stone. This is not bad, as it will test the same chemically and optically as a natural stone but is worth far less. Some shoppers may be mislead by the claim of ""Genuine Blue Sapphire"".
",4
21774,"I ordered two of these for my girls, one sapphire and one amethyst. Although they are smaller and more delicate than the picture shows, they are well made and attractive. The sapphire stone was very dark and looked black unless turned just right under bright lights-then you could see that it was a dark blue. (The amethyst was really lovely if you are interested.) Good selection of sizes, fast shipping.
",4
21785,"The ring is very pretty and my friend was extremely happy to receive it. I was pleased at the speed in which it arrived.
",4
21788,"Love the ring, wish I would have known that it came in different colors though.

21792,"Not too girly, just right as a confirmation gift for our nephew. He liked it and wears it frequently. Thanks.

21794,"I just received my 1 ctw 14K white gold 3-prong earrings from Netaya. In short:*Customer service was wonderful*Shipping was one day late, but considering it was free and I only had to wait three days instead of two, I can't fault them too much for this*I received what I ordered* I am MORE than satisfied.The diamonds are gorgeous. I was very skeptical having never worked with Netaya before, and although most of their reviews were positive, there were some real horror stories out there. Also, in my research on diamonds, I'd read very bad things about the clarity level of diamonds I purchased (I2 - I3). Nevertheless, the 30-day return policy gave me the confidence to give Netaya a try.Well, I don't know if I just got lucky with these or what, but they are stunning. Do they have inclusions? Yes, but I had to go looking for them with a magnifying glass, and the only reason I did look for them was because I knew that with this type of diamond something had to be there. The inclusions are black, but fortunately there is no cloudiness in these. I'm not a diamond expert, but all I see when I look at them is sparkle, and I believe that is all any casual observer will see.The price was absolutely amazing. I am so happy with these that I had to put a review up.I will shop with Netaya again because, even if I did just happen to get lucky with these, their 30-day return policy makes shopping with them risk-free. And for the prices, it is definitely worth a try.

21797,"I ordered the Amethyst but received the Garnet. It is still beautiful so I kept it and will reorder the Amethyst.
",4
21802,"Great ring for the price. Bought it for my 12 yr old for Christmas. She loves it. Light purple stone.
",4
21804,"The rings we ordered are very pretty, but the silver a bit softer then anticipated and was quickly distorted/bent with normal daily wear.
",4
21808,"The ring was a good fit. I wish the amethyst had been a little darker, it's almost lilac in color. Otherwise, I enjoy wearing it very much. Also, it was recieved promptly, in excellent condition.
",4
21814,"As another reviewer noted, this gemstone is a light lavendar, not the purple described. Still, it is nice. I got my usual size, but it is too big, so I'll have to return it or exchange it. What I do like about this is it is smooth - I mean by that it doesn't catch against cloth or other items. When I put my hands in my pockets to get wallet or keys, etc., some rings catch on the cloth. The smooth feature is what made me choose to try this ring, also it is pretty in design. After purchasing it, I started looking at rings as I shop around, and this ring is superior in quality to any I've seen. It is high quality for its ""genre.""
",4
21818,"Nice ring for the price. It looks great and it did not tranish so far. I would buy another ring similar to this one. Size was ture as well.
",4
21821,"I just got my ring. It is very pretty, but the stone seems darker in the picture. The ring seems very sturdy.

",4
21824,"It was a beautiful ring for the price that was paid. I am very pleased with what I got and I don't know how much can be said about the ring itself. It is shiny and thin prefect for a females hands. I wouldn't put it on a man , a bit too Dainty, Go for the wider ones for a dude.

",4
21829,"Beautiful plain wedding band that works well if you want something simple for everyday or for traveling. It is quite flat, so would work well if you are in a job where you work with your hands a lot. Because it is 10K gold, it scratches easily and doesn't stay as shiny as some of the higher karats, but still a nice ring. And well worth the price!

21870,"I am by no means a expert when it comes to diamonds or jewelery, but I did my research and read a ton of reviews and came upon these. They were very nice and I could not see any flaws with the nake eye and the color was very good as well. Great price and quick shipping. My girlfriend loved them! 1/3 ctw is a bit small, but I wasn't willing to fork over the cash for bigger and didn't want to skimp on quality.

21925,"Gave this gift to one of my ""friends"" and she absolutely fell in love with it. It's pure simplicity made it look so elegant, it's balancing a valuable stone at the end of the wire. Why gave it 4-stars, the Swarovski Cube had a little scratch, I mean the cube could like a little ""plastic-ky"" but this one is definitely a winner in all accounts.
",4
21926,"I really enjoy this ring. The level of detail is really nice, and continues all the way around the ring on both the sides and the face of the band. I've gotten a lot of comments on this ring, I think in part because the vintage look of it sets it apart from other flashier cocktail rings. I think it's more believable that it could be real if I got it from my grandmother, know what I mean? :) (I haven't lied about it yet, but I think I could get away with it if I did, the ring is pretty nice!) Actually the more I think about it, I really love this ring. I wish my wardrobe measured up to my fake jewelry! :)My one little thing about it, is I don't love the look of the rhodium plating or sealing, or whatever, there seems to be some kind of coating on the metal that makes it look just a little bit dull. And also, perhaps because the ring is so detailed, if you look at it up close (like if someone were to hold your hand still for a second and look at the ring), some of the detail work gets a little clumsy and the prongs on the smaller stones look a little bit mashed. But this is probably just me being too fussy, it's really not noticeable except to me. Overall the ring is quite beautiful, and I'm satisfied that I made a good choice.Also be aware that the ring does sit fairly high. This is nice because the stone can shine properly since it doesn't rest on your skin (i've had other rings that didn't have enough clearance), but it's just something to be aware of. The 'alternate view' photos of the ring adequately show how high the ring goes on the sides, but do take a second and look at them.Now I just have to get a fake engagement ring! Ha ha. Enjoy!

21932,"I bought MANY items from Silver Insanity, and most of their items don't look exactly like on their pictures, or the pictures give another impression. However, this is an EXCEPTION. It looks exactly like it! So... no deception! Note: Don't forget: Although it's not a toy, it isn't a serious-white gold piece of jewelry either, so the feeling is different.

21936,"I bought this for my girlfriend and she seems very happy with it. It is BIG and pretty cool.
",4
21944,"I loved the pin and delivery was amazing-3 days from order date. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because, although it basically solid and well-made, the edges were not finished as nicely as they should have been. Most people may not have noticed, and won't be noticed when worn, but as an art teacher, I have done some jewelry making and am aware of details.

21960,"I purchased these for myself and they are great. They have tarnished a bit but overall the quality is good especially for the price. I get compliments all the time on them.
",4
21961,"These were a bit larger than I was expecting - I looked at the measurements but it's hard to picture until you see the earrings. However, they seem to be very high quality and very shiny. Arrived quickly from seller in a nice little jewelry pouch. Can't verify if they're 925 sterling or not but I don't have any allergies so shouldn't be a problem. Just wish they were a little bit smaller but I'm sure I'll get used to them! Great earrings.
",4
21983,"I bought this ring for myself and it is even more pretty in person then shown!However, upon closer inspection there is what looks a piece of the stone is chipped off, so sadly I had to return this item. But I'm sure that it was just a fluke, and I will try to get another one as overall I really like the ring.
",4
22005,"Locket looks very nice, though I'm not sure how long the finish on it will last. The picture is deceiving if you think that the gem on the front sits smoothly on the surface, as it does not. It actually sticks out in a little forward tube that you cannot see in the picture. Over all though, very nice for the price!

22011,"This belly ring came sooo fast! i loved it! i put it in that day! the only problem was that one of the diamonds came out which was ok and then today the tail fell off. i still love this belly ring tho. it looks cute even with out the tail. i just wish it would of lasted longer. dont get me wrong i still love this ring and will buy from pugster again :)

",4
22184,"Based on the length I actually expected this to be 'longer' than it was. (I've bought other necklaces that claim to be this same length that are much longer) There must be a difference in how different vendors measure their necklaces. Anyways, although it's a bit shorter than I would have liked it's still a nice good quality necklace for an awesome price.

22190,"I have bee wanted a small chain that I could wear a charm that I already had. I ordered the 18 in. But should have ordered the 20 in. It still worked out. I can wear my charm now. I just wish it hung a tad bit longer.It came a little earlier than was expected so I was happy about that. I' thankful I now have a nice sterling silver chain to wear my charm.The clasp is sturdy and works fine. It is made well.
",4
22193,"I bought this chain to go with a St. Christopher medallion I was given. The 24"" length is perfect, neither too long or short. The only problem I have with this product is that after six to seven months the links break. Now I also keep it on 24/7 through showers and swimming. It stands up very well to chlorine and soap ; So I tend to think it has to be pretty durabl with what I put it through.
",4
22213,"Nice and inexpensive. Wears well with my small pendants and seems to be fairly strong without looking big or bulky. I expect it will break one day as I have 18 month old twins hanging off of it most of the time, and I'll gladly buy more of this brand.
",4
22216,"I purchased this chain as a replacement for my husband's necklace. Sterling silver, so obviously great quality. However, due to the delicacy of size, it gives off too much of a feminine vibe. It's a bit too thin and sparkly. I now have it for myself though. I think it should be removed from the ""men's jewelry"" section.

I actually bought it for my boyfriend to replace one that had broken a few times and was repaired a few times. I ordered the 18' and it was perfect. It holds a heavy silver cross so I was kind of worried, but it has held up great. He wears it in the shower, while working out, etc and isn't too careful, and its still in one piece!My only complaint is that it tarnished rather quickly

22384,"This chain is strong and has a nice weight for it's 1mm size. The silver is rather white. It's not one of those silver chains that can be mistaken for white gold. Instead, it looks like what it is...good quality, nickel free, silver. It has a slight sheen.This chain is a little shorter than my other 18"" chains. Recently, I purchased 3 chains from Gem Avenue. All are a little shorter in length. I measured them. The actual chain is not 18"". Gem Avenue measures their lengths to include the spring ring clasp. Their chains are 1/4"" shorter than all my other chains, of the same stated length. It's a small amount, but suprisingly, I can tell the difference when wearing.What I like most about this chain; it doesn't twine or twist the way some silver box links will. While wearing, it maintains it's smooth look. The little box links stay straight.

22392,"Decent 1mm chain. Sturdy. It holds up well to 10-15mm diameter gemstone pendants. We ordered the 22"" length and are pleased. Works well for costume jewelry and charms. I wouldn't buy this to hold expensive jewelry. I could see how some might have trouble with it holding up over long term. For $16.99, it's a decent piece of jewelry.

22432,"I bought my daughter a locket, the chain was very thin and broke. I wanted something inexpensive that was strong enough that she wouldn't lose it. Would recommend. Love Amazon one click.

22439,"This chain is just as beautiful as the description says it was! I would definitely shop at this merchant again!
",4
22459,"Needed a silver chain for a nice pendant and this filled the bill wonderfully. It was reasonably priced and filled the bill quickly. Thanks a mil.
",4
22477,"For the price this is a great chain. I bought it to replace the one that came on a pendant I bought my girlfriend. She loves
",4
22494,"It is a very good product and a good price. I love them and havent had a problem with them. I would recommend them for anyone.
",4
22513,"OK chain. it's slightly lighter than most and a little feminine. Bottom line is that there's not too much to say about the chain as the look is primarily about the pendant attached. I like Doublju tops from Amazon and I match this chain with a smaller disk pendant. Fashion with an edge. Blessings...
",4
22516,"I bought this item to replace a broken chain that holds a silver heart. The item is really niceand looks good with the charm. I would have gone for a heavier chain if I had realized what thesize was. It is a nice chain though and I would buy again.
",4
22536,"Liked the necklace just kinda small for hanging a pendant and feeling secure about it and I bought for my beautiful wife to hang pendant.. if buying for pendant I would say get something about 3 to 4 times bigger (width).
",4
22538,"I ended up returning this because it was not what I was looking for. The item itself was very nice, and I received it pretty quickly.
",4
22539,"I needed a chain for the pendants I purchased for my bridesmaid. It looked really nice and will prevent any allergic reactions.
",4
22550,"I was looking for a necklace to hold a locket. This necklace is very lovely but not the right match for my locket (I need something heavier in weight). Even so, I will keep this necklace to use with another piece. All is well.
",4
22564,"These chains are gorgeous and seem to be well made. The first one I received was in perfect condition and has held up well. The second one I received was damaged on receipt. The clasp gets stuck and does not spring back closed on its own. Will try for a replacement... hopefully it's just a rare manufacturing defect.
",4
22567,"I got this chain for a small silver OM charm. It works great. For the price, this is everything I wanted without paying tons for it. I haven't had any problems with tarnishing, the silver is still shiny and looks great. This is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone who has a small pentant, cross, or charm. This would not be a good product for someone with a larger item to hang on the chain. For the price and for the product staying bright and shiny, I give it 4 stars.
",4
22583,"It's a pretty basic box link chain. My girlfriend is pretty rough on jewelry and it hasn't broken yet, so it must be durable enough. Nothing special to it, but if you are looking to hold a charm, this works fine.
",4
22586,"The necklace very sturdy and strong, I am 5-6 tall and 24"" was perfect for my neck. I really love this necklace but is too shiny and it looks like female necklace and very thin. I'm afraid to wear it, so I gave it to my sister, she loves it as well. I'm a little disappointed because the description didn't specifically describe about this necklace whether is for female or male.
",4
22594,"Decent necklace to hold inexpensive but sentimental charms!Hopefully it will last longer than the other one I bought at a box store. Its something I never really take off so, we'll see if it holds up.I was happy with the purchase.
",4
22604,"I returned this chain due to the fact it was too short for what I needed, so can't comment on how well it will wear. It did look good though.
",4
22608,"Seems well made - clasp is small - but the chain is fine, so a large clasp would not suit.
",4
22609,"I was very pleased with the sterling silver chains I ordered for my two granddaughters for Christmas. Very prompt delivery and the product looks great.
",4
22611,"Received the item very quickly, love the length & price, but I must have misread, I thought it had a lobster claw clasp, but it just has the cheap spring clasp. Oh well, it was only $19, so no harm if it breaks.
",4
22614,"I like this chain. Very pretty. Seller sent it right away. Actually got it before the rest of my Amazon direct order.
",4
22619,"This chain is great for pendants, but as someone who rarely takes of the chair, I would say: Be wary of durability, My chain gets caught on things, and the first one snapped, just be warned, the clasp can break, but at the price, its cheaper to buy a replacement every once and a while than find something more durable (and a lot more expensive).
",4
22622,"I like this necklace it is very nice and looks good on me.It took no time to get to me and I was very happy with the necklace...
",4
22628,"Product is well constructed and looks great for the price. Also came very fast.. much faster than the charm that I ordered from ebay to go with it. :)
",4
22640,"I purchased this with two other items for my mom. The chain was in excellent condition and I truly am pleased with it.
",4
22643,"i liked so much this ring, it was what i was hoping for...the only problem was timing, because they had some troubles to send me the ring and came almost a little late.excelent and beautifull product...
",4
22653,"I get compliments from this necklace: not too gaudy, not too plain. It comes with a chain that perfectly accents the pendant. It's great for the price, and I love it, but it's obviously cubic zirconia and kind of sharp on the edges. Looks like the picture but slightly less vibrant.
",4
22658,"Product does not resemble the picture as much as I had hoped. In photo, it appears light green and yellow, but it is actually mostly silver, with a bright red stone set in a bronzy-gold center. Not the earthy vibe I was looking for- decidedly more clubby, but maybe that's your thing.Ring seems to be quite sturdy and well-made, and is pretty comfortable to wear. Aside from the discrepency with the photograph, I can't complain.
",4
22659,"Loved the ring, it arrived exactly when they said it would and it's really cute. The only problem is that it's a little long but besides that it's great.
",4
22664,"The earrings came so quickly. I was real happy to see the earrings. They are a bit big, but the blue is nice. I also purchased the sterling silver that is white. That pair is much more attractive and more sparkling than the blue. I gave it a four star because the blue is not as bright as I thought it would be.
",4
22671,"I got this for a gift for my sister with the healing qualities of amber in mind (use amber teething necklaces for the babes) it was actually a little bigger than i expected and i like the fact it floats around inside the spheres. my sis really liked it, it came with a nice authenticity card and i put it on a chain for her that was bought seperately.
",4
22676,"I bought this pendent and the matching earrings. I like the way the three dimensional sphere and cube shapes are used together in this pendent. I also like that the amber is free floating inside the sphere. Sometimes it make a tinging sound when you move. Looks nice when worn with earthy colors.
",4
22678,"It is very pretty and very different, however, when I wear it, it makes a jingle or ""clinking"" sound. It kinds of sits on my chest like a lump because of it's shape. Sort of awkward. Yet, when I look at it I think ""That is REALLY pretty"". Obviously, I have mixed feelings about it!
",4
22687,"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice item, but I can't help but feel that it looks like plastic instead of silver. The amber inside is very nice but moves freely instead of being locked in place, which some might like. Overall it's a good piece.
",4
22692,"of course there is not much to say about it.i like the color, the unique shape and the size.so simple n elegant.i also got the earings but was not as good as this.
",4
22694,"I had been looking for silver metal spirals for a while, so when I found these at a decent price, I jumped at the opportunity. Like a dork, I didn't notice that they were selling one at a time (never really understood why they did this?) so be aware if you assume earrings come in pairs.The biggest ""disappointment"" came from the weight of these earrings. They are so heavy, they literally elongate the holes in my lobes when I wear them. I love them but I can't wear them for too long without risking overstretching my gauges. I also have to wear them ""backwards"" in order to keep them from sticking straight out from my head.
",4
22699,"I ordered a pair of these along with the cubic zirconia. When they arrived I didn't realize how small they were. But upon examination, they look sturdy and well made. They are perfect for everyday wear. The sterling silver backing did not react to my skin. The price was perfect. Sabrina Silver shipped my order promptly and I received the earrings within 3 days. Since they were very small, nice touch putting both of them in the same box.
",4
22711,"The posted description defined exactly what I was buying and delivery was fast and convenient.
",4
22714,"I really like these earrings. I wear them to work and at home- they go with many of my outfits. Good quality for the price!
",4
22717,"I bought this for my nephew. The price was amazing, and his reaction was wonderful.J
",4
22732,"I bought these cufflinks for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves them!!! They are really cool looking.
",4
22749,"The ring is beautiful, but the size is a little small. I was sized at more than one local jeweller as a 9, but the ring was much too small.
",4
22750,"The shipping was very quick. The band was pretty nice for the price, however when I compared this with a 6mm band from a jewelry store it was not quite as thick. But overall it is a nice band.
",4
22751,"I read all the reviews before ordering this ring along with the 14k white gold 4mm size 6. A lot of other reviewers said that this ring ran small. My soon to be husband and I decided to go ahead and order it large and then just have it sized if it didn't fit. Well, it didn't fit. When we took it to a jeweler it was about a 1/4 of a size smaller than listed. But it looks great, and is very shiny. We had it sized and have no other complaints.
",4
22752,"Just got married and wanted something that was a little on the thick side... I was under the impression that the ring was going to be smaller based on customer reviews but I figure I would go for it and see for my self. The ring is perfect, very simple, looks very nice and it is just what I expected.
",4
22754,"My husband loves this ring. He says it's very comfortable. The sizing isn't to accurate though. It was off by I think 1/4 which was just enough for the ring not to fit. We had it sized rather than return it. This was the second time I had to buy the ring. The first time they sent me a size 12! I had to return it & buy another ring & wait for my money to be refunded. VERY frustrating. I didn't want to have to do the return/buy thing again, that why we just went & had it sized. I figured it would be easier that way. Besides, what if they sent the wrong size yet again? BUT, it is an attractive ring. My husband wears it every day & never takes it off, unlike his old ring. The end result was what we wanted despite the initial headaches. If if wasn't for all the sizing issues I would have given it 5 stars.
",4
22775,"I ordered this bracelet and a couple other pieces from Dahlia to wear with my mother-in-law's pink pearl necklace on my wedding day. The bracelet was very pretty but I am not sure that it is 7"" in length. It was a little small and my wrist typically fits a 6.5"" to 6.75"". Luckily there were extension loops which gave me additional room.
",4
22789,"These bracelets are very cute. looks good on adult with small wrist or a child.fast delivery, thanks.
",4
22795,"It's pretty, it's dainty, and has the tiniest gold star (so small it doesn't bother me when I'm exercising and I can wear it year round). I really like it; I would love it if it was all one piece 9.5 or 10 inches long rather than the adjustable type. But it was the only one I found with the tiny, tiny star on the chain...so I'm almost in love with this anklet.I'm pleased with my purchase.
",4
22797,"These bracelets make great little gifts for the office. I put them in all the ladies Christmas stockings last year and they were a big hit. Since they were so inexpensive, I was able to give everyone a gift.
",4
22806,"The item was very beautiful just as shown in the picture. I bought this as a gift; it was recieved well. Shipping and handling costs were a bit high for this product. The product arrived on time.
",4
22816,"I LOVED this necklace. In fact I loved it so much I bought it twice but had to give it a 4 instead of a 5 because BOTH times it dropped on the ground and shattered to pieces. And I just don't love it enough to buy it a third time no matter how much I loved it. I guess I need a more durable necklace!
",4
22821,"i really like these earrings, i dont like that the back and the post dont lock, so of course i lost the back of my earring pretty quickly. other than that i was satisfied. great price
",4
22823,"The charm bracelets are nicer than in the photo. I was very happy with mine except they came without being personalized! I asked for them to be inscribed and they came without the inscription!
",4
22828,"They are greatly sized.. They are a little heavy ( I have small ears) but a great piece of jewelry. They actually came ahead of time. They look in person as they do in the picture. They were worth the price.Whirlbefree
",4
22842,"The necklace was just OK, nothing spectacular. The adage - ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind.
",4
22864,"I purchased this charm for my girlfriend whose hobby is photography. From the look on her face and the hug I recieved I'd have to say it was a great purchase. I checked the quality and details, nice, however the biggest litmus test was her approval. Passed.
",4
22882,"My wife thought they were great. I thought they were a bit overpriced.
",4
22884,"Okay so I got this ring because I thought it looked different to what I usually have. Which it is, I bought one other ring from this company. The only issue I really have is that even though both are the same size the other ring is kinda small and this one is too big. But I didn't want to pay like $4 to get a different size because usually the other size is way too small. But I will say that it does look a lot like the picture, it is light, and a little bigger then what your first thought at looking at the ring maybe when you first get it. Over all its a nice ring for the price and the bright side is the shipping was free and it does not turn your fingers green.
",4
22886,"I had been looking to purchase a ring for awhile and when I saw this ring I knew I had to have it. It really is a beautiful ring at a great price. If you are thinking about purchasing this ring, you should do it. I liked the ring so much I even bought my sister one (in a different color of course). Beautiful ring, good price!
",4
22890,"My wife loves the bracelet but I was disappointed in how long it took to receive it.
",4
22900,"The rings the itself are well made and very pretty. We just submitted our custom numbers and within a week and half it was produced and shipped. A very comfortable fit.
",4
22901,"My wife and i love them, the quality is better then i expected. we have not waren them yet we are waiting for our anniversity.
",4
22911,"They're uneven, but not more so than they are in the picture. I think they're lovely. They have a good lustre and color, even though it's not even.
",4
22915,"I must have read over 100 reviews of different pearl sets/strands on Amazon before deciding to purchase these pearls. They were just as described and pictured, and they were absolutely beautiful in person. I bought these as a gift but they were so lovely I think I'll have to purchase one for myself too! Very surprised at the quality for the money spent; excellent all around!
",4
22916,"I really love the length and feel of this necklace. My only issue is that the color is a little different then expected. In the picture it seems like more of a silver black pearl, but when they arrived they are more dark purple/maroon than gray. Still love it, just a different color than I was expecting.
",4
22917,"My wife likes the pearls but we had trouble with the latch. We ended up having to replace it so that was an additional expense.
",4
22921,"The order was as good as it's picture. Received ring very quick and ring was in good shape.
",4
22939,"I am delighted with these pearls. Am not a jewelry expert but have a good natural eye and I really like the way these look. They are very light colored (not beige or pink) and bright and pretty against my neck and clothing. And a good length. Very pleased.
",4
22942,"The problem with online shopping is that you can't be sure what you are getting until you see it in your hands, no matter how detailed the description that they give is. The ring is not what I imagined but still nice. The setting is beautifully made, fairly heavy and has a substantial amount of gold. The metal is smooth and shiny. I bought a tiny .27 carat diamond to go with it, and I feel that the setting kind of overwhelms the diamond. The ring is still pretty but if I were shopping at jewelry store, I might choose a different setting or a bigger diamond. But there is just no way you can get this kind of price from a jewelry store. Overall, I am quite satisfied with my purchase.
",4
22948,"I have been very pleased with the Sabrina Silver rings and would purchase as a gift in future.
",4
22962,"The rings are small and fit well for everyday use on any number of outfits.
",4
22973,"I like these fairy earrings because they are a bigger size than most. I dont like small earrings. However for $50 I thought they were overpriced cause they are lightweight material and kind of cheap looking. I would have liked something heavier and the crystal pieces more substantial. These were more a $25 earring but the customer service was great and I kept them anyway because I love fairies! Kandy W.
",4
22975,"So I love all armor rings of Silver Insanity as I have bought those with all different colors of natural stones. Having said that, to me this one really comes out great. Real armor in a ring which I actually wear on my ring finger. Very comfortable and sufficiently big, as I am a fan of big unique chunky rings.
",4
22981,"I just received this ring today. It is really pretty and sparkles alot. It is small but I mean its a 1/2 carat total. If you are a simple girl and are looking for just pretty this is the ring for you!! If you are looking for some bling huge rock its not.
",4
22991,"Looks just like the picture just a little smaller. Note the size is 1/2"". I like the uniqueness and daintiness of it. It is a three dimensional charm. Would've preferred for it to have a spring ring clasp or lobster claw clasp so that I could hook it onto different charm bracelets.
",4
22995,"the ring setting is gorgeous.. but it has ""AMAZON"" written inside.. that totally blews the deal of...we bouthg this ring for my brother in law girlfriend and that really put him down.. it was a great deal, but felt so bad when we saw the inscription inside....Oh well..
",4
23005,"My husband was very happy with his new tie tack. It matches my engagement ring he gave me oh so long ago
",4
23012,"But I guess I but a size too large. It's very beautifuland unique. I guess I'll try wearing it on my thumb (but even then it's still too big! wah!!!)Oh well. Next time I'll order a smaller size.Thanks anyway.
",4
23021,"I am so pleased with the selection of this toe ring as it was shiny and quite beautiful. The toe ring arrived prior to the estimated delivery time which was an added bonus. I would definitely recommend this product.
",4
23023,"the toe ring fits nicely, not too snug or binding. It isnt as wide as I thought it would be, good thing!! doesnt turn and twist on my toe...good toe ring all the way around.
",4
23024,"I loved this ring when I got it. However, after about a year, it snapped in half. So, I bought another one. Again, after about a year, it snapped in half. Won't be buying another one, even though I did love it and it was extremely comfortable. I'm going to look for one that has a solid outside border since I think that's what led to this one breaking. It would probably be fine for someone who isn't on their feet all day.
",4
23042,"I would not be able to wear this, it's very smallish, but it fits my daughter perfectly!!She loves it!!
",4
23052,"I ordered these cobalt blue glass plugs in the 0g size. They seem a bit shorter than in the picture, but are just the right length to fit my earlobes snugly. When viewed from the front (while being worn), they appear very dark blue, almost black... the color appears more blue when light is shining through them. They're great for work (or anytime you want your gauged ears to be a bit more subtle/toned-down) because they look almost like ""button"" style earrings. Overall, they seem well-made and I'm happy w/ them. Mine arrived in a small box padded w/ lots of bubble wrap to prevent breakage.
",4
23055,"I lvoe these classic wise sayings, unfortunatley the font size is so small. Would be nice for a scale to be next to the item to better give you a size perspective.
",4
23063,"Good presentation jewel case, Lace and cross well done (but cross is silver plated, full silver Will be better). A good choice for Buffy's fan.
",4
23077,"I would recommend you to purchase a smaller pendulum.It is easier to use and lighter.The design is very impressive.
",4
23080,"Since my last review I have found that this is in fact a very good focal point for circle work.
",4
23089,"My 13 year old daughter has ben wanted a locket and when she saw this one, was love at first sight. She is enjoying her necklace. Is so adorable on her.
",4
23092,"I bought it for my girlfriend. It was a little discolored when it came out of the box, but I took it to a jeweler and he cleaned it up with steam. I didn't like the necklace it came with so i bought another one to go with it. Now it's great, she wears it almost everyday.
",4
23107,"The product is just how it looks in the picture, I can wear them with a lot of things and look nice and discreet.
",4
23110,"Like these earrings because they're unique. HOWEVER, you still have to be careful about them falling out. Bent over to get some plates out of the dishwasher for dinner and found one of the earrings staring me in the face! So glad the plate was there to catch it as it fell out.
",4
23113,"Shipped quickly and the product was what I was looking for! Great gift for 14-year old!
",4
23122,"It is really cute, a little on the small (and heavy!) side. After a day of normal wear, i did notice the silver tones underneath. I would not wear this as your every day jewelry. As an above review said, I would save up for the silver stuff. Maybe its supposed to look antiqued, who knows...
",4
23148,"Ring was nice, and unique. The points do snag on things though. And one of the ""diamond"" chips fell out but you can't really tell.
",4
23149,"Love the looks of this piece. Very classy and elegant, yet does not preak the bank.
",4
23164,"Sadly this ring was so pretty, size 6 was to small for my fingers so I couldn't wear and it fell off my necklace and shattered, but other than that it was very nice.
",4
23167,"The ring was an instant success. My friends loved it. It loooks amazing.i only hope it is a genuine moonstone.No way of telling it.
",4
23168,"The largest size available was an 8.5, luckily I wear an 8.5 on my ring fingers... this ring only fits on my pinky, which seems about a 7.5 normally.
",4
23172,"It's a great ring for the price, doesn't seem real, but is a good synthetic.
",4
23173,"It's a beautiful ring, i do believe it is synthetic in its make-up. But do not let that deter you from purchasing it, under the right conditions it has the aurora borlias effect. The ring is very beautiful and i gave it as a gift, but like all the other reviews: IT'S FRAGILE. It broke after about 2 hours because of a small mishap. Good buy though at this price.
",4
23175,"The ring's coloration was wonderful... Just forgot that it can be somewhat fragile... It cracked after a week of regular use... I would recommend this ring for people who won't be using it as an everyday accessory...but overall I was happy with my purchase...
",4
23180,"...but order a larger size than you think you'll need, because the bands are thick and since it's entirely stone there's not as much ""give"" as with a metal ring.
",4
23187,"I recently bought this product and it differs a little from the color on the picture but it really is lovely. My fingers are skinny and the ring dwarfs my fingers but i hung it on a chain and it looks really lovely. So even if it doesnt fit just right it looks great on a chain
",4
23208,"I am not a fan of big, bulky jewelry. This pendant is on the smaller side so I was very pleased with the size of the heart itself. For the price, the diamonds are of good quality and the necklace itself sparkles. My only complaint with the pendant is that the loop the chain goes through is nearly the same length of the heart itself. I guess it's designed that way so you can wear it with just about any thickness of chain you like (since there isn't one included).
",4
23234,"I was so excited to finally receive this eternity charm; it replicates the popular designs sold in jewelry stores.I'd say it is very pretty and sparkly...great value for the cost! Mine is a little off-kilter (by that, I mean the circle is slightly uneven, meaning that it doesn't lay totally flat on a table), but it is definitely not noticeable at all when worn.The only thing is, this charm did not come with a chain (or necklace). I guess I just assumed it would come with one (even though looking back, there's no mention in the listing), but I ended up spending $20 at Target for a chain that worked for me. So, in the end, this ended up being a $30 necklace. Still, it cost less than going to a fancy jewelry store and it looks great!In my past experience with CZ, I'd recommend taking this necklace off to shower or even to put on make-up. I've learned that any moisture can make the gems seem a little cloudly, and this charm seems like it might be a little tricky to clean to get back to its original sparkle.
",4
23238,"I am happy with the way my order was handled. The product was delivered in a couple of days.
",4
23263,"I really wanted an eagle pendant, and this one was very nice. I am very happy with the purchase, and I like the ""weathered"" look it has. It's also very strong and looks great. The only thing I didn't like was the chain it came with. It's really small and thin, a little too feminine for my taste.
",4
23265,"I received this pendant in a timely manner. It was beautifully packaged in a box, with a chain. I was very happy with the details in the design and the quality.
",4
23272,"Gorgeous - my mother in law loved it, which is almost a shame since if she hadn't I was going to keep it myself, it was so lovely!
",4
23277,"I bought these for my daughter (7 years old), but they're a bit larger than I expected. The fairy itself is cute, though obviously nude, so be aware of that if you are purchasing for a child. I'm not sure if I'm going to give them to her this year, though, because they seem too large for her ears right now. The earrings are not heavy, and seem to be sturdy. I say ""seem to be"" because no one has worn them yet. It matches perfectly with theSterling Silver 7"" Fairy Faery Link Bracelet Jewelry, which I also bought.
",4
23282,"Love this ring. The stars are about as dark as pictured. Very comfortable although it feels thick to me. But I have small hands so that could just be me. My only complaint is it does turn my finger grey (Sterling Silver does that, I know, but it is annoying.) But I've heard after I wash it a few times and wear it in that should go away.Overall? Sturdy and for a good price!
",4
23287,"I am highly allergic to most metals. I can wear these ear rings 24/7. From a distance, they even look like real diamonds and rubies. I would have given them 5 stars except the backs are so tiny that in a few years the hand tremor I inherited will make it impossible to pick them up or put them on. Also, one needs keen eyesight to see the backs -- another problem advancing age will create. The second major difficulty is that they are fragile enough that the posts simply wear out after a while.It is wonderful, however, that my ears are, for the first time in about 40 years, so uninflamed that I can slide the post straight in with no problem, and I have trouble seeing the place to put them in because there is no redness.
",4
23289,"Necklace is cute, but is kind of lackluster. Not the best quality but okay for $20 or less. Anything more would be overpriced.

23299,"I like this piece well enough, but I'm only going to give it a 4 out of 5 because off the picture. The picture doesn't reveal that the pendant's sides stick out about a centimeter or so. The visual effect is somewhat unpleasent and the picture they show doesn't reveal this spect of the pendant at all. Still, it was ok.

23305,"The Large Loving Family was larger than I expected so I exchanged it for the smaller one. Returning it was an extremely easy process and the replacement was shipped right away. I absolutely love my new charm. The only thing I didn't like about it was the chain. I used one of my old ones.
",4
23311,"I love this necklace and have wanted it for over a year now. I have never seen one like it. I finally splurged and ordered it for myself. My only complaint is that it is too large for a somewhat small framed person like myself. I exchanged it for a small, so I am waiting to see how that will be. Other than that, I love it!

23343,"Just received this ring set in the mail today, and I must say, it is lovely. It's difficult to find a cubic zirconia ring where the main stone is of reasonable size because I didn't want to wear 2 or 3 carats. This one is large enough to notice, but not too big that it's screaming ""LOOK AT ME!"" This ring really shines in the light, even the little stones on the band twinkle. I really like the matte finish of the middle band because it allows you to really notice each layer of the ring.I hate it when people call cubic zirconia ""fake"". I'm not trying to fool anyone, and if anyone asks, I'll tell them it's cubic zirconia. There's no shame in owning something that is MORE sparkly and more affordable than diamonds! If you could buy a diamond that was as clear and gorgeous as a cubic zircona, you sure as hell wouldn't be shopping on Amazon for bargains. That being said, I don't think anyone will be asking if it's ""real"", because the average person won't be able to tell the difference.What gives this ring 4 stars is that the main setting is rattling a bit. I don't want to bother with exchanging hassles, so hopefully the problem can be solved by a local jeweler. Shipping was ahead of schedule and I love the price! Other than that, the ring is beautiful and I'm very happy with my purchase. I don't get married until the end of September 2010, so I'll be back a few months after that letting you guys know how the ring is holding up under everyday use.
",4
23352,"I love this ring. The delivery was very fast and came in a pretty box. Unfortunately, I have to send it back for a replacement because the middle stone is a little loose, not very tightly mounted in the prongs. Otherwise, this is a gorgeous ring and very believable- looks like the real thing. It looks much better than the picture.

23363,"This has a nice, substantial weight. Amethysts pale violet. Fine, but not for a larger wrist. Dressy.
",4
23371,"I was surprised when I received this necklace--I totally thought the beads were larger in diameter! Although the coral beads are not as big as I had hoped, the necklace is well made and worth the money.
",4
23376,"The spinning part is a bit narrow compared to the total width. Good for those who fidget. The fit between the two parts is enough to allow the center to rotate but not enough to allow it to rattle when it is being worn. She likes it, so that's good enough for me.

23393,"I have always been a fan of archery and have long since tried to get into it as a hobby. Now that I am graduated from college and working full time, I have the money and time on weekends to pursue it! I really wanted a cute but simple arrow pendant that was fancy enough to wear on a nice night out, but sturdy enough to wear to work as a Vet Tech to display my passion for the sport of archery. This necklace is definitely very pretty, much more so in person, though it seems a little more delicate than the pictures makes it out to be. The picture, to me, makes it seem more like it is made of pewter, and a little more solid, when in actuality it is far more delicate. I'm sure if I applied enough pressure I could easily bend the arrow. However, it still seems well crafted and I have already worn it several times. I will probably not be wearing it to work since it is lighter and more delicate than I had anticipated, but it is still accurately portrayed in the seller's details. It came wrapped in a silver box and both the pedant and charm were each packed in their own little zip lock bag. I am very happy with the quality and look of the pendant and would buy it again over some of the other, less attractive bow and arrow pendants on Amazon, I just won't be wearing it to work where I wrestle with dogs and cats on a daily basis :)

23408,"I didn't pay enough attention to the shipping costs while checking out, yeaouch. Not nearly as great a deal as it seemed. Product arrived pretty much exactly as pictured. Was properly packed. Pretty little earrings.

23412,"I look for this glove pendant for almost 17 years and I almost bought it in 2 occasions. I'm very happy to bought it on amazon and the item is very beautiful and the people in my family liked it. I belive my friends also liked it and I'm proud too to carry an item that remembers me of the unforgetable Brockton Blockbuster (Rocky Marciano)and also the Italian Stallion (Rocky Balboa). You see , I'm a great boxing lover and I recommend this item to other people who appreciate the sport too.

23413,"The pendant was flatter and slightly bigger than I imagined. I wanted it to look more like a ""real"" boxing glove. But it was a great gift. It was a hit. Thank you. Great seller.

23445,"I got this as a gift for my birthday and it is absolutely gorgeous. It was my favorite gift and I wore it everyday. However the chain is so delicate that it broke (i'm also very clumsy) and now i'm having a difficult time finding a replacement chain. I recommend this gift but only for women who are graceful and not as active as I am.
",4
23448,"I got it for my girlfriend. It is my initials and she loved it. She wears it all the time now.The chain is thinner than I expected. It is a very nice piece and I would say worth the buy as a gift.

23451,"I received this item pretty quickly. it's a cute little ring, but its more for younger girls.
",4
23471,"These are beautiful earrings. They sparkle in just the right amount and are both elegant and subtle. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for their next pair of earrings or to make the perfect gift. The only negative I'd say is the hook and latch are pretty soft and if you're not gentle they'll bend. Also the hooks themselves are pretty short so it's a bit of a pain to get them in sometimes. All in all, I think they'd look great on anyone:)

23500,"The earrings are pretty.They sparkle in the light but I don't think they are really Swarovski. I just thought I would have received a paper or something along with the earrings authenticating the crystals and I didn't.That's why I gave it four stars.

23519,"I bought six earrings for myself and my sisters over xmas. all crystals in different colors from this seller. i bought 4 tear drop crystals in blue, pink, green and clear, this earring, and another one similar one to this - sensational clear. this earring is by far the best buy. it catches the light charmingly and is long enough to be seen past the hair.i would say don't buy the other colored crystals, buy this one or the other earring which is similar in design and clear... they really are pretty and seem to dance in the light. my sisters loves them.
",4
23521,"These were purchased as a gift for my niece and although she hasn't received them yet, my own teenage girls think that they are lovely. They are very sparkly and the color varies from clear to quite colorful, depending on the light and nearby colors.

23525,"Beautiful pair of earrings, had many compliments on them. Would like to view more like them in the future. Thanks

23528,"I was hoping these earrings would have had more color in them like the picture. But they are clear. Disappointing but they are still pretty.
",4
23529,"I wish when they designed the hoop portion that the part that goes through the ear was somewhat straighter so that you could put them on more easily. It took me a good 5 minutes to get them on by myself. Otherwise, I love them once they are in the ears.

23537,"These earrings are nice enough for the money spent. They are very pretty and nice to wear to work. I like them well enough, I guess I was just expecting something a little different after reading all of the other reviews.

23560,"Every piece of jewelry that I have purchased thru Amazon I have bought from Dan's and I love everything I have. The rings and necklaces are amazing. Everything is unique. You can tell they care about their customers and I get everything on time and have never not received anything. I am very satisfied with everything!
",4
23575,"These earrings are just what I was looking for, but couldn't find in any local store. They are very small, so be certain they will fit ahead of time by measuring precisely. The only problem I had was actually fastening them in my ears. Once fastened, however, they will stay clasped together. It took me about a 1/2 hour to get them fastened! Would recommend however...
",4
23580,"This earring is surprisingly TINY. In the picture they look a lot bigger. They are really meant for a new born or a barbie doll. But they look very nice as a tragus ring though. The claps is kinda difficult to connect but still a good product

23624,"I love my double dolphin ring! The dolphins, however, are hollow, and though comfortable enough while wearing, the thin edges have caught and cut the loose skin of my knuckles when removing the ring. I used extra-fine sandpaper to round the edges under the dolphins, which helped. Still a great ring for such a low price!
",4
23639,"The earring was very small but that is what I was looking for. I use it in my cartilage piercing and I don't like the big earrings in there because they are not comfortable. I have been wearing it for a little over a week without any problems. Also its a pair and I didn't realize that when ordering it so I'm happy because I have a backup one if this one falls out.

23683,"these earring are really sweet, but they are really tiny!! If you are a person who likes big earrings, these may not be for you, but I have small ears and earlobes, so these work very well for me. The company is great and even sent me a catalog and a 10% coupon.

23691,"I'll preface this by saying that my tastes run toward higher-end jewelry. I bought this as an inexpensive surprise gift for my wife, as she likes things like this. She loves it! She's received numerous compliments on it, and wears it often. It does look better in real life than it does in the picture, as it does a good job reflecting the light. It arrived promptly, and was enclosed in a small but secure package.
",4
23693,"These earrings are teeny-tiny. I mean SMALL. Yes, I knew they'd be delicate from the picture-- and I knew they'd be 12mm in diameter. But the gauge of the ""wire"" part of the earring is no thicker than 18g. Very thin.I was looking for tight-fitting, small hoops for everyday wear that wouldn't get in the way at the gym or dojo. These definitely don't get in the way... and they'll have to be everyday earrings, since there's no way I'm wrestling with the damn things to replace them more frequently than every couple of weeks. This pair was easier to get in than the others from the same collection of earrings from this seller-- those were a nightmare. These probably would've been harder for me if I weren't used to the others (and regular captive-bead rings like in my navel.I'd reconsider ordering these if you have anything but the most elfin of features. If you're like me, and have more than one set of holes in your ear, I'd definitely recommend these for third-hole-and-higher usage.

23703,"These were a nice size, but they were pretty difficult to get on. I thought the hinge back would be easier but the size was too small for man fingers! Definitly need a womens help. He has had them on for over 2 months with no complaints and they look great!

23705,"I totally loved these earrings and almost kept them for myself. I purchased as a Christmas gift for my niece whose birthday is in December (topaz birthstone) - Not too big or too small. The color and clarity and shine were all beautiful. They weren't packaged very well - earrings were placed individually in a small plastic zip-lock type bag. The jewelry bag included wasn't very nice so I didn't use it and had to purchase a separate box for presentation and gift wrapping.

23716,"I was pleased by the color of the topaz. It matched my swiss blue topaz necklace. The earings were true Swiss Blue Topaz. The price was great for the size and quality. The backing quality was ok.

23726,"I bought these for my daughter-in-law, who is a soldier in the Army. She can wear earrings with her uniform, as long as they are post/studs and don't dangle. Well, these fit the bill to a tee! They are a good size, are sparkly, nicely feminine, and a really good price. Thanks, Amazon!
",4
23732,"Bought these for my wife, and she loves them. Only issue I would have (and I don't know Topaz) is that the cut seems just a bit off. They are great looking earrings at a great price, but they don't seem as brilliant as they should. I don't know if the cut angle is off, the girdle is too thick or if I am just being to critical but the cut seems just a bit off.And I do say just a bit. I would definitely buy these, not again - but for a GF or wife. You won't go wrong at the price, it just seems lacking a bit in a less than describable way.These are a close to must buy (at least at the gold box price) but there is something just a little bit odd about them in my eye. Well worth dealing with for the price though.
",4
23742,"These earrings had gotten several great reviews & the price, with discount, was right considering the relatively large size of the stones and the 14K gold setting. I just have a problem with coated & color treated blue topaz. They never look natural to me. They never seem to match up with other blue topaz I might be wearing. This color was pleasant, but not identifiable as blue topaz.On the positive side, they were relatively large & good for ""thick earlobe"" people due to their weight. The strong setting was rather high. The 14K gold is good for sensitive skin. They had a wonderful sparkle.Unfortunately, there were many bald or clear spots in the earrings. I purchased 3 prs. as gifts to match up with pendants. Of course, they will not match the natural color of the pendants. (stones are darker than picture) They will still make nice gifts when transferred to a more presentable box. I don't advise incorporating these as part of a set.
",4
23816,"My coral and jade pin looks beautiful and has good quality workmanship. The only shortcoming I could see is that the clasp could have been better constructed. It's a little stiff. I like my pin because of the graceful design, pretty pink coral carved flowers and dainty size. At about 2 inches long, this is not an overpowering pin. I thought that it was a good value for a costume jewelry item.

23844,"The pendant is really nice, and was smaller than I was expecting. The down side is I don't really like the cord it came with. It was difficult to get the waxy cord to tie a knot and then when I did finally I couldn't get it around my head.
",4
23845,"I like this pendant a lot. It's about the size of a dime, but the star in the picture is not like the star on the pendant. The star on the pendant doesn't have the overlapping of the lines like the picture, but instead just a star with the pentagon in the middle. I didn't think that it was that small, but it's still nice and i like it. :) i didn't think that it would come with a cord(black), but it did and its very short. I ended up taking it off and using a chain from one of my older necklaces. I was also worried it might leave green lines like cheap jewelry does, but it does not do that. overall very pleasing, but not quite what i was expecting.
",4
23853,"The picture of this item must be of a wider band, or a MUCH smaller stone than a one carat (1CT), as my band is quite a bit thinner than the picture. As well, the stone is slightly more yellow than the picture portrays this one to be (especially noticeable in natural light).However, all-in-all I still love the ring and plan to keep it. For the price, you can' t beat the brilliance of a moissanite.I've uploaded my pictures on the product page for reference.

23861,"I bought these for my daughter to replace another pair that I bought her at the renaissance festival. These were nice but slightly smaller and less heavy. They look good and she likes them alot. I also bought the pendant to match.

23863,"The ring is very nice looking, comfortable to wear daily, but gets scratched easily. The diamond is VERY small.

23866,"These are cute little trinkets meant to strike up conversation. And they do precisely that. A little uncomfortable to sleep in at first but it's something that can be gotten used to; if you prefer they be taken off at the end of the day, then that is a possibility as well.All in all, they are a cute pair of earrings that double as a conversation starter. I love them and am wearing them now!

23868,"THESE WERE GREAT THEY ARE VERY PRETTY AND NOT TOO BAD OF A PRICE. I WEAR THEM EVERY DAY AND THEY SEEM TO BE HOLDING UP PRETTY WELL.
",4
23883,"I really like this ring. The color of the citrine is slightly lighter than in the photo. It's a lighter golden yellow, but very pretty. I don't think it's too big at all. The center stone is a nice size but the band is smaller giving it a more delicate look. I think it was a good buy. True to size, sparkling, lovely color.
",4
23907,"I bought two of these. One for me, and another for a friend of mine. I like the design... The picture doesn't do it justice. It is far more clearly a mushroom in real-life, and the parts that are not the mushroom are clear (so it's easier to make out).However, my one complaint is that the ""natural"" hemp necklace is a little too natural. It has no clasp, and in order to put it on you literally have to tie together loose strands of hemp. This can be a little time consuming. If you don't put it on just right, it'll fall off later, and if you tie a knot that is too tight it is difficult to get off.

23910,"I have bought a 14"" omega chain which is good. Unfortunately, there is no alert that the 14"" size chain is is intended for children. I know its not the sellers' fault but mine, however, seller should alert the buyer that the size 14"" chain is not intended for adult.Its beautiful.
",4
23931,"I ordered this necklace for a young girl to hold a little turtle pendant I purchased for her. The pendant has some weight and does come with its own chain, but I thought the omega would give this young girl a different, but still delicate look. She will be able to use this chain with any pendant she may have or receive in the future. It's a sweet necklace that, once she grows out of it, can be passed on to one of her younger sisters. I was pleased with my purchase.

23934,"It is little bit too big of a stone for my long cylinder finger, but I love it. The color is very rich and dark that goes with thick YG. It catches people's eyes. I recommended it is a keeper. PR in Hillsboro, OR.

24052,"I bought this ring almost a year ago and I haven't taken it off (it's the only ring I own). It seems to come slightly bigger in size which I prefer. I can't wear rings that are tightly sized. It's also a little thick so it may feel uncomfortable at first. And there are many places for lotion or soap or such products to get into. Every now and then I have to take an old tooth brush to clean it out. Otherwise, it's a nice, simple ring.
",4
24055,"This earrings are very elegant. I especially enjoy the chains because they give a softness and grace to the earrings. I wish the stone had more color, but that may very well be typical of aquamarine.
",4
24065,"I really love this product! It's just as beautiful in reality as it is on the photo. The only thing I don't like is that the shaft is a little too long for me so it shows a little from below. I may try to change it for a shorter one and see if that works. Otherwise I am very happy with my purchase!
",4
24074,"These earrings are just beautiful. Very white, clean looking and sparkly. The IGI certificate that came with mine lists the clarity as SI1/SI2,and the color is F/G, which is great. The polish and symmetry are listed as ""good."" I think that all around, these are very nice quality especially for the price, and I am very happy with them.
",4
24078,"I bought this for my wife and she loved it. It is beautiful and of great quality. My only problem was that the ad claimed the necklace was 18"", when in reality it was only 16"", with a 1"" drop, which did not help size wise around the neck. We spent $40 to have the chain lengthened (as this was cheaper than buying a whole new chain) and now she wears it every other day. The diamond is a decent size and it is a unique piece of jewelry.
",4
24080,"I purchased these earrings and I am excited about the quality but not the size. To be fair, I knew little about diamond studs until I did research on Amazon and learned a bunch over the course of a couple of weeks, but the one thing I wish I'd seen was pictures of diamond studs in ""actual"" size next to each other -i.e. not blown up on the screen to look pretty. The 1/4, the 1/3, the 1/2, the 3/4, and the 1 carat total weight pairs would have been nice to see all at once. Had I seen this I might have opted for the larger size (and perhaps slightly lower quality so as to afford it). Yes, you can print the helpful ""actual size"" report from Amazon, but this does not have any small sizes except for the 1/2 and 1 carat studs (and nothing in between).One more thing, the gemological report that I received was NOT as detailed as the ""sample"" on the website. There appears to be an actual photo of my diamonds on my report but you do NOT see the drawings that show flaws and occlusions. This would have been nice. Also, there are fewer descriptive terms in the ratings than I expected. For example, on my certificate it says ""G-G/G-G"" for Polish and Symmetry. Although it was bound and presented well, I had hoped for something more like the sample on the website.On the flip side, these diamonds are really high quality. I compared them to a coworkers larger studs and it was immediately apparent that these were colorless and clear (to my eyes) while the others were a bit cloudy and not as nice.The quality of the studs was as advertised. One stud was VS-1 and the other was VS-2 and the color for both was G-H. The Total Carat Weight was 0.72 (not the 0.75 as hoped for) but this was above the guaranteed minimum spec. of 0.70.The product was received very quickly, and was well packaged and presented. I would absolutely purchase this type of thing from Amazon again...

24089,"Earrings arrived in time for the holidays. The earrings look great, but after the 10th use, the screw-on clasp on one earring has been giving my wife trouble. I contacted Amamzon and will get a replacement. I'll update info after replacement arrives.

24090,"Needed a nice gift for my wife and didn't want to pay top $$ at the local stores. We were both very pleased with the look of the pieces as well as the packaging. All the specs met or exceeded those promised. The IGI certification is a simplified report, perhaps appropriate to items in this price range. Only big disappointment is that a mounting apparently broke seven months after receiving and one earring is lost.

24119,"It is difficult to purchase a diamond sight unseen. Here's some things that may help.-You will get a good quality diamond here.-It saves a lot to not pay tax or shipping (why I purchased the Amazon vs. the NY vendor item)-There's not much difference in size between a 1/4ct and a 1/3ct stone and you can get the large stone for about the same as the smaller stone if you buy a I color, &quot;I&quot; clarity.Advice:-Decide how much you can spend. Cost can increase fast with diamonds and it is helpful to know your budget.-Visit a local jewelry chain and compare sizes of the stones you are considering. 1/4ct is the smallest pendant you should buy and some may find that too small. I surprised my wife with this, but knew that the size of the stone would not matter.-I opted for a quality stone over size. That could have gone either way. If the size of the stone were important, I would have gone with the 1/3, available here for about the same price.-Since my wife's ring is white gold, I wanted a white gold setting for the pendant. That meant I had to get at least a &quot;H&quot; color or the stone would show just a little yellow against the white setting.-You can always send it back/exchange it if it doesn't work.The piece itself is a 5 star item. I gave the whole package 4 stars because the box (which is quite nice) the pendant came in was too large for a 1/4ct stone and made a small stone look smaller. The IGI certificate that came with the stone also has a different (better) color range than was advertised. That's good, but it is different and makes me wonder why.All-in-all, if you're looking for a nice diamond pendant you can't go wrong with this one. Just be sure you know a little about the size and the other factors that go into the stone, although at the 1/4ct - 1/3ct range it really doesn't make that much difference. And you can relax a bit more purchasing a pendant than an engagement ring, where you may want/need in-person help.

24132,"my girlfriend loved it. I have my doubts about the swarovski crystals but it's a nice pendant anyway. has some weight to it so make sure you have a decent chain or necklace. a bit on the small size though (maybe an inch)
",4
24147,"Bought this set for my wife's birthday - she loved it.The quality and the pearl dimensions are as promised. She has received many complements for the classic look of the set.The clasp can be tricky for someone to put on by themselves, or if they have a medical condition which limits fine motor detail.

24170,"I really like these pearls, just got them as a Christmas gift. I felt the size was very large and the colors and sizes are really well matched. I'm really happy with the purchase and this is a great deal for 5 pairs. The pink is a very nice pale color, I thought the green was a little bright and doubt I'll wear them often. The orange/yellow is a strange color and will also not be in daily rotation. I'm really impressed with them overall and am happy with Amazon.com's collection
",4
24171,"I got these on a today's deal, and I have to admit, I'm pleased with them. They are pretty, are actually a good size for my ears (not tiny-hard-to-see size).The colors are MUCH subtler than the picture amazon has here. But, that said, they still are attractive and usable. A good everyday sort of set of earrings. If you wear a lot of pastels or pale colors and like the feminine look of pearls, I say get it. Not expensive, discreet, pretty.Mir
",4
24175,"I got these for my wife on Mother's Day between purchases ofFreshwater Cultured Pearl, Citrine, Peridot & Amethyst Bracelet, 7.5""on Valentine's Day andFreshwater Cultured Pearl, Citrine, Peridot & Amethyst Necklace, 18""for our anniversary in July. She likes them a lot, but I also had a friend who makes jewelry create something reminiscent of14k Yellow Gold Freshwater Cultured Pearl, Peridot, and Blue Topaz Earringsthough in sterling silver. She REALLY loved the earrings my friend made, so she doesn't wear these as much.
",4
24178,"These earrings are really pretty. There are not real great variations in the color between each set (they are all pastel, after all!) but each has a beautiful sheen and color.They are also set very firmly on the backs - I was worried that, for the price, they wouldn't hold up. But they are very nicely made.The packaging was okay, but not deluxe. What I appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls, which I found informative.All in all a good purchase and well worth the money!
",4
24180,"Earrings were very attractive and nicely packaged. My wife was very pleased because so many options were available to her to wear with other multi-colored pearls. Great value.
",4
24182,"As with all natural pearls, the shapes are not perfect. Only cultured pearls are perfect, because man controls them. The dye is uniform and the size is perfect, big enough that they can be seen easily. The colors; pink, white, gold, and lavender are clear. Even the green is a clear green, just not my favorite green.
",4
24185,"The pearls are nicely matched, and are a good size. I wish the posts were a little longer, and the studs a little bigger. I do enjoy wearing them.
",4
24189,"I purchased this as a gift for my teenage niece. It is beautiful! The color is great and the flower is adorable. The only problem is that it is very long for an anklet. When you look at it you think, ""too short for a choker style necklace, too long for a bracelet or anklet"". I tried it on and it was big for my ankle (I would say I have average adult ankles). On my ankle it hung down quite a bit, but did not touch the ground. It's a shame because it really is a beautiful anklet.
",4
24208,"I see other reviews saying the bracelet isn't good. It fit me fine, and was about as nice as you can expect for jewelry at this price level. It was actually probably nicer than I expected. Overall a good piece. I've work it to work and had many people comment on how nice it was.
",4
24220,"The stones were nice and sparkly but the stems were both bent up upon arival. I did the best I could to straighten them but they still don't look right. Overall just glad the wife liked them.
",4
24227,"The bracelet mix of colors works well together. The amethyst chips are rounded, and are not annoying nor poking. The bracelet is big looking with all the rows. The stretch is snug on my 7"" wrist. Enjoy wearing it.
",4
24231,"The opals are quite fiery though on the small side. The settings are strong and stylish. This set is rather delicate but of a fine quality. I was after a longer chain, and will change it. The pendant sits just below the collar bone. I was hoping it would sit closer to the cleavage.
",4
24234,"I have various kitty things on a key chain and this is my latest addition. It was too adorable to pass up. It arrived quickly, as pictured. Only concern I'll have will be over the ""kitty crossing"" dangle. I fear it may end up in the bottom of my purse one of these days because it's thin and attached only by a single unwelded loop. Otherwise, it's just adorable.
",4
24236,"I looked everywhere for a martini charm for my sister's 21st birthday. I had a hard time finding something that looked quality. This charm is gorgeous. It is a little smaller than I expected, but worked perfectly with the charm bracelet.
",4
24246,"My wife was very happy with these earrings. I was pleased that they looked more expensive than what I paid and the sale price was very good.
",4
24292,"These are beatuiful, but they are a little larger than I expected them to be so they hang down from my lobes.
",4
24296,"I bought this necklace as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law. I tried them on just to make sure they would look nice and I was pleasantly surprised. They are a nice weight and look like a nice fashion piece. I wouldn't mind having a set in my collection.
",4
24324,"I received this two days before the expected delivery range began. It looks very nice overall, except that the chain is extremely thin and delicate and the ball stud was smaller than I expected (it matches the picture exactly; I just didn't look at the photo very carefully). So handle it with care. I was fitting the cuff on my ear and had to open it a little wider--I was so afraid that it would break--but the cuff is tough enough so that it opened slowly, with some determination from me. It's tough yet pliable and holds the shape very well. It doesn't pinch at all.I was surprised that the chain was so short (roughly 3.5 cm, an inch and then some) and for the time being I've replaced the original chain/stud with my own chain and stud. The original chain is indeed quite short and dangles just below the ear, so if you want it to be more noticeable I recommend that you replace the original chain with a longer one (you can buy lengths of chain and ball studs at craft stores).I'm actually returning this cuff because I prefer to have them in pairs. For that I would personally recommend ""Sterling Silver Coiled Wirework Ear Cuff Pair Earrings"" by Silver Insanity, also found on Amazon. It's only $4.99 + $4.99 shipping for two ear cuffs (cheaper than paying $12.58 for this one) and I plan to attach my own chains and studs. That's just me, though. If you're fine with wearing just one at a time instead of two, this is a great item. No complaints, for the most part. A great product!
",4
24330,"I bought this ear cuff for my nephew for Christmas. He put it on immediately upon receiving it. It looked so good on him, I bought one for myself!
",4
24346,"I really love this product, the chain is very tiny and light and the cuff fits my ear perfectly. The cuff doesn't even hurt and it feels like its not even there. However I ordered 2 of these one chain is shorter than the other, but its a really great earring. Hot Topic use to have a product similar to this but after it was out of stock, they never bothered to make more. But anyhow if your thinking about buying it, GO BUY IT!!
",4
24347,"I have had this product for a week and I have noticed both good and bad things about it, but I am pleased overall with my purchase.Positive: The cuff was the right size and the whole thing looks great. After I got used to the cuff pinching my ear a little bit, I haven't noticed it at all, and the cuff has remained in place on my ear. The best thing about this product: it's made of sterling silver, so if you're allergic to Nickel, even if you wear the cuff all the time it won't hurt your skin.Negatives: The ear cuff did not look exactly like the picture shown; the middle of the band is a much simpler design than what I was expecting to receive. Also, the chain has disconnected from the stud once already (on the first day that I wore it); thankfully I was able to put it back together with minimum difficulty, as the small wire loop that connects the chain to the stud is easily bendable.
",4
24353,"I got this product for my daughter and she loves the style and feel of it. However, She was wondering where exactly the cuff part is supposed to hook onto your ear. She's not really sure to put it lower or higher on her ear. Could someone please explain to me where to put it or send a picture. Thanks.
",4
24354,"beware that when you buy, you only get one earring, not a pair.
",4
24416,"I've had this toe ring for months, on my toe, and i never take my toe rings off... it stays put and doesnt give me any issues, nor has it broken!
",4
24429,"I was happy with the look and feel of this product. However, if you do decide to order it, be careful not to over stretch the band. I bought 20 of them for friends and a few of them have broken in half.
",4
24480,"I received this ring today and I was very pleased with the look, quality and price. The coloring is very close to the picture on Amazon, which is not always the case. It is currently only available in a size 10, so I do have to wear it on either my thumb or middle finger and even then it's a bit loose. I couldn't pass up the deal when it was offered and I'm not disappointed at all. Yet another good buy from the Amazon.com collection!If you want some other pieces to wear with it I would suggest these:Sterling Silver Amethyst Hoop EarringsSterling Silver Amethyst Pendant, 18""
",4
24485,"I bought two of these as gifts for my mom and mother-in-law and they both loved them. They are very pretty while being quite sturdy and well-made. The only disappointment was that it is only available in a size 5 so we had to have them both sized.
",4
24487,"I like these a lot. It can be hard to see the color of the gemstones well because of the way they are set.
",4
24508,"I was pleased when they arrived. been looking for pearl earrings that dangle & have a lever lock. Very well made too.
",4
24518,"They're exactly what I expected for $17. Not the classiest thing I could buy, but they go well with many looks for me. The pearls are about 7mm as advertised and the clasps are sterling silver. I really like the clasps that stay put so I don't lose them. All in all a great product at a great price.
",4
24519,"I bought these earrings for my wife. They are well designed and the pearls are really beautiful. They were a little larger than I expected (a comparison scale in the product image might be helpful). However, for most people I expect that would be a bonus since, in the world of gems and pearls, products often arrive smaller than they appear, not larger. All in all though, they are very nice earrings and I'm glad I purchased them.
",4
24541,"These appear to be well made. The backs stay on well -- don't slide off on their own. The posts don't irritate my sensitive ears at all.However, when they were first shipped, they were slightly tarnished. I wiped them with a soft cloth and they look fine now.
",4
24544,"I bought these as a replacement but they're much smaller than my old silver ball studs. They're quite small. I'd probably buy twice as large next time.They don't irritate my earlobes and the posts stay on well. They do the job.
",4
24546,"I really like wearing this bracelet. I did, somehow, think that I was getting a real bone bracelet, but even so I have enjoyed the bracelet very much. It is comfortable to wear, and it goes with so many outfits.
",4
24548,"The earings are of a good quality. BUT, these earings became a bit tarnished quite soon even though they are made of sterling silver. This probably happened from their contact with water. I hope that I can do something to restore the earings back to their former luster. I hope that my polishing cloth will remove the tarnish.
",4
24561,"Heart Pendant is beautiful, but the chain was tangled in nots.. it took meabout one hour to untangle it....
",4
24562,"I bought two of these pendants for my teenage daughters for Valentines Day, as our family has been through a tough several months taking care of their Mom, who has breast cancer. My daughters were very touched by the gift, and they certainly were excited to know that yes, those are genuine diamonds and ""real"" 14K gold. It is a dainty but pretty pendant, and my daughters have worn them so much since presentation, I know they mean a lot to them ... this pendant can be worn with either very dressy or even very casual clothes, and is striking to the eye in either case.
",4
24585,"These ""millefiori"" beads are small, gorgeous and delicate. The only thing I would have done differently is made them a lot bigger! Why so skimpy from a design point of view?
",4
24595,"I bought this bracelet as a gift for my mother. I couldn't really tell from the picture, but the crystals in the middle part of the bracelet are quite a bit larger than those at the ends. I wasn't wild about this, as my mother prefers more minimalist jewelry, but the bracelet is absolutely lovely and shines beautifully. I was almost sad to give it to her because I'd have to give up being able to look at it whenever I wanted.Very beautiful piece of jewelry - just be aware that it is a bit ""large"" and the middle is thicker than the ends.
",4
24599,"Looks just as displayed. Only thing I didn't like is that the yellow color you see is much brighter than in reality. The whole thing almost looks silver with a dusty yellow.
",4
24600,"I was actually impressed with the pendant itself, though you will definately have to purchase a better chain, as the one that comes with it is ""flimsy"". I would recommend this product to all the proud wiccans out there. Blessed Be.
",4
24607,"This is a fantastic little pendant, but the chain is worthless. I had to get another chain for it. I do with it was a little bit larger, but it will do. Looks fantastic on. I would recommend it specially for a teenager or younger person b/c of its size.
",4
24609,"got this for my mother in law for christmas. she wears it all the time. it looks a lot like ""brighton"" type jewlery. it is smaller than i expected, but i like it.

24610,"The pendant is nice my wife is very happy with it. We got the order quick. The only thing that was missing was the gift note other wise I would of gave 5 stars.
",4
24611,"Love the pendant, but not the chain. This is one of three necklaces I ordered on here. All three came with thin chains and sub-standard clasps. But I bought this for the pendant, so over all, I am happy with my choice.
",4
24615,"The pendent is really nice, however it is .5 - .75 of an inch, for some reason it looked bigger to me on the picture. The chain defiantly needs to be replaced. I strongly recommend getting the earnings that match this pendent as they make this set complete.
",4
24621,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I thought it was lovely but then I like small unobtrusive jewelry. It is very delicate looking. I couldn't really tell if my daughter liked it much at all, she didn't seem smitten with it. The chain is ridiculously thin. i would recommend buying this just for the pendant and purchasing a better chain. It would even look nice on a black silk one.
",4
24626,"It's very simple and elegant. Sits just right, chain not to long and very easy to clean. Received many compliments already!

16533,"A lot smaller than I thought...I did read what it said, still just had them pictured differently even though I measured them on ""paper"", so really check the size..however on the positive side I have worn them constantly..slept in them, showered wearing them for days at a time and they are still there, clasps are very solid, excellent quality and actually because they are small, are light so don't pull on your lobes

13530,"A lovely pair of diamond earring studs! I received them as a birthday gift from my parents.. Both earrings are the same size.. Nice cut - sparkle nicely in the light.. Cannot see any flaws with the naked eye.. Perfect size earring for everyday use. I wear them in my second ear piercing.. The backs stay on tightly. I leave them on all the time.Honestly I think this pair I got from Amazon is comparable to more expensive ones I've had from jewelry stores.

I would suggest giving this a try if you would like to know how you would look with a piercing with spending a lot of money getting it done. It is light weight and easy to adjust.

16718,"About the closure. I found that there is a little flexibleness in the earring so instead of clicking or snapping the wire into the clasp/closure, I flex the hoop a little and slide the wire into the closure, similar to threading a needle but much easier. So far so good.I've been wearing these now for several months and I love them. They were actually much nicer than I thought they would be. They look great dressed up or down.

They're small enough (for a young girl), but not so small that they're invisible, plus the clasp is secure. I was very pleased with this purchase.

15266,"After having a baby and losing around 45 pounds, my navel piercing doesn't look like it used to. Every ring I've gotten doesn't fit right like its too loose, or if it was a top dangle would get caught on stuff and irritate it. I was considering just taking it out and letting it close up. Not this one! The dangle doesn't feel heavy so it doesn't pull down, but it is good quality and not flimsy. The bar fit my piercing perfectly so it doesn't look like its just hanging there. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who is having problems with the bar being too long and wants something different from just a plain standard barbell! Fast shipping and very well packaged. Couldn't have been better.

16711,"After having already bought my wife several Christmas gifts, a little bird (sister-in-law) informed me my wife would also love a pair of gold, 2"" hoop earrings. My search began. I discovered these on Amazon at a reasonable price and decided to order them for her. I frequently order from Amazon, and, as always, was impressed with the ordering process. The earings came well packaged in a small pouch enclosed in a nice box. The quality was much better than expected, looking like a much more expensive set of earrings. They are very light in weight, with a very sturdy clasp. They look great on my wife and she was very, very pleased with the purchase.
",5
15222,"After much searching, I decided to order this armoire for my sewing room as a compact storage piece and worksurface. It arrived in about 1 week and took my husband about 2-1/2 hours to assemble. All the pieces were there and the instructions were easy to follow. I've now had a chance to organize it and work at it, and I love it!The quality is what you'd expect from Sauder: solid for the most part, but with a few chintzy-feeling components. The smaller shelves and backboard are made from that glorified cardboard stuff, and the casters are cheap plastic. However, this piece has some surprisingly nice touches, such as the 270-degree hinges that allow the doors to swing almost flush with the outside of the armoire, the integrated triple electrical outlet, and the smart design of the slide-out desk. There's not another piece like this available in this price range, even considering the hefty shipping charge. The amount of function Sauder packed into this design makes it well worth the price.I'm not fond of the country look of the doors and the distressed finish. I might paint it black and add some sheet metal over the faux louvers on the doors where I can magnet some of my design ideas. But this piece changed the whole function of my sewing room, where formerly most tools and materials were stored in numerous boxes.

13801,"After my wife passed away and it finally felt right to take my wedding band off, I still wanted to keep it with me. I wore it on a necklace for a while before thinking a locket would be better. It took at lot of searching, but finally I found this. It was great. The right size to keep my band in. The interior is not padded or anything so if you're using it to hold a keepsake like a ring you'll need to look into putting some cloth inside or something or you'll hear it rattling around in there. As a guy, I liked the look because there were no flowers or sequins that'd make it look overly feminine. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

13186,"After only doing this video once, I already loved it! It was exactly what I was looking for: an intermediate flow series to help me take my home practice to the next level. The DVD is not traditionally chaptered, but the ""scene selection"" feature allows you to begin the practice at 12 different points. I'm not going to list every pose included; rather, I'll provide a general overview to help you get a feel for the practice.Tilak Pyle instructs via voiceover, and he and his 4 assistants are each filmed in different outdoor location. The practice begins on the floor--which I found to be a nice change of pace--starting with a meditation and simple seated forward bends. You then move to standing, but instead of going right into sun salutations (not my favorite thing), Tilak leads you through several balance postures (tree, eagle) as well as half sun salutes (very reminiscent of Yoga Mind and Body). You will then move into some lunges, including a moving ""liquid"" lunge and one with the forearms on the floor (similar to in Ana Forrest's Strength and Spirit). The first standing series consists of warrior 1, 2, triangle, and side angle; short vinyasas are performed between each series, but not between every posture. After plank/side plank, there is a second standing series focused more on balance postures: pyramid, warrior 3, and half moon. Next, you'll move into dog pose, open your hips, and then continue with pigeon. This is followed by a short child's pose series which includes several shoulder stretches and then a brief savasana. This is about the 45 minute mark, so if you don't have time for the entire practice, this is a great place to stop.The second half of the practice begins with a spread leg standing quad stretch and then moves into standing wide-legged forward bend. Next you'll lie on your back for reclined leg stretches, including hand to foot and thread the needle. From a seated position, you'll perform rock the baby and a forward fold with cat/dog tilt. Next comes headstand, which Tilak and co. perform unsupported but which I did against the wall. I rarely practice headstand on my own, so I was surprised when I was able to kick up fairly easily and hold for the duration of Tilak's soothing voice (not a long hold; probably &lt;1 minute). Another child's pose and a brief pause follow. The final segment of the practice begins with seated forward bends and moves into shoulderstand, lying and seated twists, yoga mudra, and finally, relaxation pose. The asana practice ends here at about 1 hour, 15 minutes, but Tilak allows an additional 10 minutes for a long savasana, pranayama (alternate nostril breathing and retention), and final meditation.The DVD offers several options for customizing your practice: you can select minimal or more detailed instruction, and both choices allow you to turn the DVD music off and substitute your own. Other DVD bonuses include a detailed asana list--offered in both Sanskrit and English--and ""deleted scenes"" or outtakes. Don't miss this last section--Tilak and crew are hilarious as they struggle with uneven surfaces, wind, bugs, external noise, and the like. Tilak is a young, soothing, calming presence throughout the DVD. His voiceover instruction is excellent (only occasionally moving slightly out of sync with the screen), and while his instruction is not overly detailed (this is an intermediate practice, after all), I found his form pointers to be helpful. His style reminds me very much of Erich Schiffman in Yoga Mind and Body; in fact, this entire practice had a very similar ""feel"" to me to YM&B;, which is also one of my favorites.I really can't think of anything negative about this DVD, but if I had to offer constructive criticism, I would offer two very minor points: 1) additional arm balances would have been nice (crow is shown in the deleted scenes but is not included in the practice), and 2) I would have liked the music to continue through the final savasana--there was just silence, and I keep looking up at the screen to see if the DVD had ended or not (which I'll obviously know not to do in the future). Overall, however, I loved this practice and found that it was just perfect for my level, which I consider to be low-to-mid intermediate--hopefully this practice will help put me in more solid intermediate territory, and I know that I will use it often. Highly recommended!

When I first opened the box, I was disappointed: it was light, the silver does look different from my other white gold jewelry (this is my first silver jewelry). The stones are not as sparkly as the diamond on my ring.However, the size fits me very well(I am 5""2 petite) and the size of the stones are just right. It looks very pretty! I decided to give a try before returning it.After wearing it for a day, I started to like it. Now two weeks passed by, I am in love with it!Considering the price I paid for, this is a GREAT classic looking bracelet! Highly recommend!Bottom line: a fun, pretty and classic piece for the price!

Best ring hands down for shallow piercings, it looks great!

And, would it be shipped in a timely manner?Both concerns were answered when the ring arrived only days after the order was placed. Not only did it come in a cute gift box, it was more beautiful than in the picture. My wife loved it. It is a promise ring of sorts, after my initial proposal seventeen years ago. I told my sweetheart that this ring is a token until our twentieth anniversary, when I want to renew our vows before friends and family.Until then, this ring is a great reminder of two hearts joined as one.

17804,"Beautiful earrings-This is the fifth piece of blue topaz I've ordered from the Amazon.com Collection. Their collection of blue topaz is very, very good quality at a great price. These stones are clean, even under magnification, I sell jewelry, so I checked. The stones are a very bright diamond cut. Quality set, in 14k with a substantial post. It's solid, not reed thin, and flimsy. The butterfly backs fit securely(good friction). The color of the stones are like the Carribean Ocean glinting in sunlight. The size is about equal to a 1/2k diamond in each ear. When wearing, the setting nestles into your ear, so all you see is blue topaz. Even if you don't like mixing metals, you can wear these earrings with a necklace that is set in white or yellow gold, it won't matter, because all you will see is the stone. They are really lovely, very brillant and bright.

She likes them because they are great for the office (she's a banker) and she can sleep in them also. So I got a lot of brownie points going into 2013! Real good deal also.

16668,"Bought these as a Christmas gift when they were offered one day for $39. Wish I had bought a pair for myself. They were beautiful and a perfect size ... not too big, not too small. I intially thought I'd have to buy a very small pair of hoops at an even higher price. So I was a bit worried these might not be that nice. Since they were a gift, I can't attest to how they wear (which is too bad!), but they do look like a much more expensive pair of earrings.

Best $40 I have ever spent...
",5
13414,"Bought these earrings for my girlfriend this past May. She says she really likes them because they can go with almost any outfit and when she's working in the office setting they aren't too gaudy or distracting. The price I think is very reasonable if you are looking for a good piece of jewelry that isn't going to break the bank. The diamonds are a little darker but you can tell they are blue, especially when light hits them. They are pretty small, but you aren't going to get a better price even if you go up to 3/4 ct, which honestly isn't a noticeable difference in size. Very fast shipping and tracking info. I am a repeat customer of Amazon and with great products and service I will be a customer for a long time.

Great price for a perfect gift.

15363,"During hunting season, my husband lost his wedding ring. We purchased it when we got married five years ago, and he was devastated to lose it. We didn't have $400 to buy another one, so I started looking aound for a ring that he would like and that would stand up to factory work. This ring is absolutely beautiful and weighs very little, which he enjoys. I can't speak yet for how well it'll stand up, but it's been a few weeks and so far it's looking good!**EDITED TO ADD** It's been almost a year later and the ring still looks great. It needs a slight polishing (he works at a manufacturing plant), but so far it's held up absolutely beautifully. I am very happy I ordered this ring!

I had them double the size of the sapphire (2.5 mm to 5.0 mm) and make the diamonds bigger (.08 ct each and not .02 ct each).

12539,"Finding this necklace was partly due to searching out one that would match a pair of earrings I bought. Somehow it took me a month to find it, but when I did I ordered right away.First off the earrings I had were these onesSterling Silver Small Cushion-Shaped Drop Earrings. Very simple and casual, so finding a necklace to dress them up was important. If you look closely at the necklace you'll see it actually has one of the ""cushions"" in the center so it was a perfect match.When I received the necklace I was most impressed by the size and weight, it is definitely a quality piece. The double chain was a nice addition and when measured end to end (clasp included) it was 16"". Although the 3 squares are free of each other, it lays flat because of that short chain length. I may try it out on a longer chain to see if I can get more movement out of it.In looking through my jewelry I found a second pair of earrings that I can wear with this also.Sterling Silver Open Square Dangle EarringsWhich makes my purchase all that much better. Whether you give this as a gift or keep them for yourself you can't go wrong.

15077,"First & Foremost I'd like to thank Silver Insanity for selling such a wonderful item. I ordered this ring on the 16th of July and when I checked the tracking it listed that the estimated arrival would be on the 21st. When I came home tonight after a long day at a concert, I noticed that it came in the mail.Very fast delivery and excellent quality!!! I'm in love with the great detail that it provides, Just like the picture! I don't usually wear rings, but I think this will be on my finger for a long while. You get the beautifully designed ring along with a velvet (not sure if it is or not, but it's somewhat soft) pouch to keep it in when not wearing. Would possibly be a great Birthday or Christmas gift. I would recommend this to anyone who likes spiders or is into the Gothic Look.I FREAKING LOVE THIS RING!!!! :D

It is small, but still noticeable. If you're into more subtle jewelry, this necklace is for you. I absolutely love it! The chain is actually pretty, as well, which was a bit surprising considering what was charged.

The next morning I received a phone call from the lady from discoveries informing me that the pendant wouldn't make it until x-mas (which of course I already knew.) She then told me that she did have the name I wanted available in another design. (Which turned out to be the design I wanted in the first place. I had ordered wrong!) She shipped it out the day we spoke and I received the pendant the very next day! Talk about fast shipping! The pendant and chain were beautiful and my mother-in-law loved it. She has called us 3 times so far to thank us! After seeing the work and dealing with the company, I am absolutely going to buy from them again.

17494,"Following a recent surgery with complications, I starting having some problems with stress, fatigue, and difficulty focusing. My physician performed several tests and found nothing that would account for my ststus. This was a surprise as I am not the type given to hypochondria or somatization.I decided to look at alternative solutions to my problem. After reviewing several types of products dealing with bioenergies, I thought I'd do a trial of the Q-Link pendant. With a 90 day return policy, I had nothing to loose.Within 2 days, I noticed feeling much more relaxed, less fatigued and actually able to sit and read a book for an extended period of time. My wife, who had been out of town on a business trip, even commented on how much less stressed I seemed to be.I'm impressed. So much so that I just purchased one for her.Ignore the detractors who likely have never tried the Q-Link and don't be dissuaded just because the theory on why it works is difficult to understand. With their money-back gaurantee, you have nothing to lose.

16383,"For every three gifts I purchase for others at Christmas time- I purchase one for myself. This necklace was a present for me. Because of its unusual nature and occasional chime, I often get questions on it. I appreciate the fact that the chimes do not ring with my every movement, and even though my husband refers to it as my ""cat bell"", the chimes are quite subtle. If you grab it, and actually shake it- the chimes are much louder- this comes in handy when you are bored, or looking to annoy someone. I love this necklace, and haven't taken it off since I got it.

",5
13661,"For the price, this is a very pretty cz tennis bracelet with a lot of sparkle. It is delicately made, so be sure to be careful when taking in on and off. The center clasp on mine has a tendancy to stick, so I find its helpful if I remember which side of the clasp to push down on. On mine it's the same side as the safety latch. This way you wont be tugging on it as much and since it is fragile don't wear it in bed or bend it much. As with any fragile or delicate piece of jewelry, (which practically goes for all solid gold jewelry now-a-days), you just have to be careful with it and it will last a long time. I recommend cleaning precious metal jewelry once bi-weekly if you wear it daily. Just warm water with a mild dish soap detergent usually works well. I would definately recommend this piece of jewelry to anyone thinking of buying it. Be gentle with it and check the tightness of the side safety clasps as soon as you receive it. If they seem loose at all you can tighten them by gently squeazing the sides in. If the side clasps fit snugly then it shouldn't fall off your wrist.
",5
12771,"For the price, which was about 17 bux with shipping and handling, the quality's a lot better than some other necklaces of comparable price. Shipping was really fast with this store-it came in about 3 days. I'd recommend a different chain though, because it was really thin. But the piece itself was in really nice condition. Definitely a keeper.

18433,"From my husband, for our 10th anniversary. I love these earrings--a beautiful dark blue, and the screwbacks are nice and solid.
",5
16487,"From the moment I saw the large blue box which the necklace came in, I felt like a princess - or Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. This necklace is perfect for my wedding dress. Our wedding bands are white and yellow gold with a rope pattern, and I was looking for something that fit that theme. I was worried a little bit, as my dress has silver overlay, but the yellow gold is much more delicate in real life than in the picture. The silver rope is more substantial and looks like it is worth a great deal more. This necklace absolutely sparkles, and the picture does it very little justice. In fact, I almost unordered it but I am so glad I didn't. All the women in my office were gathered about in awe. The comments ranged from ""that is truly beautiful"" to ""you're making too much money"" to ""I have never seen anything like that before."" All exactly what you want to hear about a reasonably valued piece of jewelry. This was a good first experience with buying jewelry over the internet.

12520,"Got this for my daughter for her first christmas. She was just under 7 months old. I use it as an ankelet, so when she wakes up or wiggles I can hear her. Now 9 months it still fits her perfect and it has extra loops to make it bigger or smaller. It is so cute and very well made. She has now figured out if she kicks that little foot it makes nosie so it is also entertainment. Think I will buy one for a baby gift down the line.

14920,"Got this pendant about a month ago and, once I tracked down a chain I was happy with, have worn it every day. After going thru a series of personal tragedies last year, looking at this phoenix symbolizes and reminds me of the new beginnings and rebirth in my life.Well, back to the phoenix. It's well crafted and I LOVE the design. While the image on Amazon is very good, it really doesn't convey the intricate details on this pendant. Looking at it, you can see the attention to detail that went into the design. From every feather on the wings to the eyes and beak on the head (the triangle at the bottom)Excellent service and prompt delivery from Silver Insanity. Would be happy to do business with them again (and I already have since).

17328,"Got this to hang a pendant I had made for my fiancee. It's a very fine, thin chain but has a design that looks amazing under light- shines and sparkles as if it were crystal studded. The links are very fine but appear quite sturdy despite that.I got this as a 16"" chain which fits her just right, but she's a really small lady. For someone of average height, it would probably be too short. I was a bit concerned that the charm I attached would be too heavy, but it doesn't seem to be an issue at all.The chain came in a velvet pouch and box. It is all clearly well made and very elegant.

13909,"Hello!I've had this ring since Roderick Tenorio first advertised on QVC on TV. This ring has last me about four years now, and going strong. I had a skin reaction with lots of turning green and peeling (allergic to nickel, I think- not sure), but after that initial discomfort, my finger has a nice little spot that shows I've had a ring on for quite a while.The ring itself is beautiful. Love it, love it. I work at a job where I'm always using my hands, and this ring hasn't even gotten scuffed up yet, which is incredible given what I've put it through. I can't praise it enough, and I feel naked without it. I still get compliments on it too! A truly beautiful piece.

17283,"Here is a great gift idea and a great value as well. For the price of just under $200, these are 14k yellow and white gold pieces that are stunning in style with a mirror-like finish that is a real eye-catcher. They are of a fair size and look heavier than they are. They are well made and nicely presented in a gift box and a velvet pouch. They are stylish enough to be featured in a 5th Avenue window where they would probably sell for 2 - 3 times the price of admission here. Running out of time for your sweethearts holiday gift? Just pay a few more bucks for next day delivery and you are all set! I just don't see how you can go wrong with this fine set of earrings.

I also like that they are kind of thickiesh, very noticeable ans shiny. A bargain! Thanks AMAZON.

17501,"Hi everyone-Disregard the other uninformed review; ""high-tech"" appears to be misused; I suspect the reviewer may mean ""new age""; I also suspect he has never worn a Q-Link nor read any information published about a Q-Link; a pity someone so ignorant is permitted to opine on anything beyond his name and/or his birth date. The Q-Link is a remarkable product; and no more""high tech"" than a computer (suspect -- we should stick to the clay tablet and stylus) or the telephone (silly -- two cans and a string should suffice) or a ballot/voting machine (we should all raise our hands and pray that those in Washington D.C. can count) . . . .EMF protection is a burgeoning science; why?

",5
16540,"Hoops exactly as seen in the picture, they are indeed light (as the price suggests, since gold is sold by weight). They look elegant and polished, though, and the good clasp is a definite plus. I always keep losing hoops because they fly off my ear somehow, and these have stayed put, no problem. All in all a good purchase. ------I have had them for a few months now, and so excited that I have not lost them as usually happens with hoops. I have other hoops from a different maker, have to be constantly vigilant because they will end up on the floor or in my clothes every time I brush my hair with my hand or use the cel. Not this pair, these are just great and stay put, no worries.

16850,"I absolutely adoreee my earings, they are just te right size if your looking for something nice and simple for everyday wear. They are really comfortable, not heavy, and they don't bother at all when you'r on the phone. But what i think is most important of all is that the lock is really really secure!! And really unlikely to open.
",5
16651,"I absolutely fell in love with these earrings. They look classy and elegant while at the same time you can wear them with casual clothes. They are about an inch and a half wide and length wise to give you a better idea on size. They are so comfortable that I often fall asleep with them on and don't notice they're still on till morning. I know I'll be wearing these for years to come.

17424,"I absolutely LOVE this little charm. I wear it on a snake like white gold chain everyday and it's just beautiful! Quite small, a little bit smaller than I expected but looks great. As must as I've worn this charm it hasn't got the slightest scratch or lost it's glow. Definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to have a little reminder of the Buddha to rub on and pray to throughout the day. I find it works great for mini meditation moments when at work or walking.

18693,"I absolutely LOVE this necklace! I like that it's not the traditional baby's head hanging from your neck...never did like those. This is a contemporary art piece. I can't believe it's only $25! My only complaint is that I wish they would have offered it in white gold. So very pleased! This makes a great Mother's Day gift!=)
",5
57920,"I absolutely love this necklace. I've worn it every single day for the last four months straight. The diamond is so clear and it really sparkles. I wear my necklace when I sleep, exercise and shower without worrying about it breaking or turning my skin green. Its great by itself or layered with other necklaces. 1/10th of a karat is very small but the diamond shines brilliantly. I have received a lot of complements on this necklace.
",5
16041,"I absolutely love this pendant. I ended up taking it off the chord and put the pendant on a slinky silver chain I owned previously. The bevel in the back of the pendant is not very large so you might want to be careful before removing anything. Its very shiny and sleek, it doesnt look as grainy as in the picture. Very pretty and not expensive making it a great find. My hubby tries to steal it from me constantly.

57,"I actually bought this to wait until my actual engagement ring came in. I have to tell you everyone loved this ring SO much I returned my engagement ring and kept it! Of course I did not tell them the price LOL! When it needs to be cleaned i put it in some sea salt and it comes out beautiful , with great fire!
",5
57836,"I actually ended up buying these earrings twice. The first time I thought that they were a little too simple for what I was looking for at the time--so I returned them. I kept looking at other earrings without any luck. What I wanted was a pair of earrings to wear everyday, but I wanted them with some diamonds, white gold, and not too big. The next time that these earrings were on offer (during Diamond month) I bought them again and now I wear them all the time. The gold is heavy, the diamonds are a nice size (althought they don't shine very much). The earrings look elegant and simple, and are comfortable, perfect for everyday wear.

They are great bags, and we'll definitely be using them in thenear future. Another note: These bags were received the day after I ordered them, which was a big plus in my book.Thank you.
",5
17026,"I actually think it is prettier than the picture indicates. Lot of facets that look beautiful as the light hits it. The only real difference I see from the picture is that the center part tends to have more gold facets than the picture shows. One small complaint is the chain it came on is pretty thin and tends to tangle easily, but the chain is easy enough to swap out if it is that much of an issue. I love the fact it is two-tone so you can pair it up with other pieces of jewelry in silver or gold. The 1"" size definitely makes a statement without being too big. It is a pretty intricate piece, so I tend to think it looks better with dressier clothing, but it looks fine with casual clothes too. Have received many compliments on it. It is very unique.
",5
16049,"I added these to my wish list this year while browsing through earrings.. I can't say enough how glad I was to have received them as a gift. They look even more delicate and elegant in person. I have received countless compliments on them, and cannot believe the reasonable cost on these earrings. I haven't gotten such unique and affordable silver jewelry in the US ever! At this price these are the kind of earrings I would have expected to get while traveling in places like Guatemala, Thailand, Indonesia, or Honduras.

I guess perhaps it is made of natural stone, the one that I ordered is as deep a blue as shown in the picture, with streaks of paler blue. But yes, it is much bigger than I expected it to be, and that was after reading the previous reviews.It is worth the price I paid for.Yes, another great product from Silver Insanity.

18166,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a fine ankle bracelet. Very pretty, very nice quality. Unfortunately, I have ""cankles"" and not ankles, so it was a bit too small for me to wear. I'll give it to a friend. This anklet does not come in a bigger size, so I ordered a different style in a larger size -- also from Gem Avenue. I'm hopeful it will be just as nice.

14769,"I already have a pair of star earrings and someone said they would love some, so I was so delighted when I saw these,and I am sure my friend will be so pleased. Thanks.

16924,"I already own the smaller single mirrored gold ball pair of earrings and like them so much that, when I discovered the slightly larger pair with three mirrored gold balls, I knew I had to have them as well. After reading the review of the larger pair by Mark Allen Rogers, I was persuaded and convinced to make the purchase...LOL...didn't really take much convincing, but...thank you any way Mark.

18250,"I also purchased the matching necklace, very pretty and a good value for the money. I have seen these in retails store at a higher price.

14156,"I always have trouble finding the right fit for anklets so I wasn't optimistic with ordering this one but for the price, I didn't think it would be a total loss if I got it and it didn't fit. First, it came super fast which is great. And I am happy to report it fits! I have Samoan ankles so it's not easy finding my size lol.I love it so much I'm ordering another one. Very happy customer!!

15416,"I always wanted a snowflake pendant and asked for this for Christmas. It is much better quality for the money than I expected. The snowflake is larger than I thought it would be, which is a good thing! The chain is attractive, though it seems shorter than I expected- but it works. Everyone actually thought the CZs were real diamonds! It is beautiful and unique.

14180,"I always wear leverbacks. I wanted something in silver and a little more visible than what I usually wear. These are great -- swingy, not too heavy, and beautiful with my new spring greys and whites.
",5
17259,"I always worry that what is shown in a picture doesn't truly represent the item. This is especially true of jewelry, since pictures make things look so much bigger. Several times I've purchased jewelry based on a picture, only to receive a tiny piece that nearly requires a microscope to see. I'm happy to say that these earrings are exactly as pictured. The gold is thick and the crossover style is truly elegant. The earrings are lovely and they will make a very nice gift.
",5
16706,"I am a hoop-earring-wearer and have lots of hoop earrings. I only wear gold, and I must say I was really happy when I opened the pouch these came in and saw how nice the earrings were. I thought they would be flimsier for the price. They are a nice solid earring, just right for big hoops. Lightweight, but they don't twist and bend. They appear to be very good quality. I will be taking good care of these babies. :)

17931,"I am a very modern person who still like to see the influence of classical or traditional or heirloom styles in jewelry. This ring is timelessly elegant and even more stunning in real life. I had to have it sized smaller to a 5 1/2, but its gorgeous and totally worth it. I can wear it anywhere as the stone is dressy but subtle enough for daytime too. And the smoky quartz make me feel unique... its not something everyone else has.... I love it!!

18457,"I am getting married in a month and had purchased a ""square"" ring from another site, which I liked, but just did not look all that square to me (I had seen an awesome, very square, chunky design in the form of a cheap ring at Aldo that I was trying to replicate in some way, even though the ring I ended up with was much subtler).So this ""square"" ring, at first and even second blush, looked rather...round. Plus, it was a 14k ring, which looked too ""silvery"" to me, as my skin tone is flattered by Autmn-style colors, needing a richer gold color.So, I decided I'd go where the competition was and go to a round ring. If I couldn't get my square edges, at least it would be chunky and a good deal.I had tried round rings, even comfort fits, on at jewelry stores. They were thin and feminine looking. Clearly they were trying to skimp on the materials, and often they were 14k. I noticed the prices were significant at places like Helzberg, being $400 plus, often $500 or more for a ""substantial"" ring, a price I was unable to pay.In any event, I decided I would try this ring.Something to note is that once you go from size 10 to 10.5, they add an ""extra"" 1mm to the ring. So, it goes from 8mm to 9mm. Of course, you are paying additional for the additional metal, but it does make the ring a little more substantial top to bottom once you hit 10.5. I am an 11 so I ended up with a ""9mm"" ring in my basket.I received the ring today and it's a beauty! HEAVY! Wow, my hand has a whole new heft to it, it feels like. This is MUCH MUCH heavier than the thin 14k squared ring I was sent as above. This ring is pretty hefty. Most anyone would be proud of it.On the inside it's stamped with the obligatory ""18k"" but also a little infinity symbol, which I thought was a little ""spiritual"" touch to what is most likely a wedding band for the majority of buyers.The ring sits higher above the finger, so it has a profile and height. It is not like a thin little band that hugs your skin. On me, those looked positively feminine. I hated them and that is why I ran from round rings and wanted a more masculine square one.It slips on easily, is very comfortable to wear and slips off with a reasonable amount of wiggling and cajoling. In other words, perfect. True to size, yet even more comfortable than other rings I've tried. The comfort fit interior is very ""pillowy"" and smooth. Nice.The heft of this ring makes this a great compromise for me, and the PRICE is FANTASTIC!! Feels like one of those $500 gold rings for much less. THANK YOU, AMAZON!UPDATE:Oh man, heaviness is a blessing and a curse. I have now gotten married and have worn this ring for a month now. I sort of wish I'd have gotten a lighter band. I still feel this thing weighing down my finger, i.e. the sensation hasn't ""deadened"" for me. Not a nightmare, not necessarily annoying, but just a little distracting point.Also, since this ring is comfort fit and ""puffs out"" (is rounded outwards) a little both on the inside and outside (it's not like a straight ""pipe segment""), I feel it on the first bone of my middle and pinky fingers when my fingers are together. A little annoying.Of course, I really wish there were no such thing as wedding bands to begin with, I've never really cared for rings! Why not a bracelet or tatoo?! (Half-joking here, and I digress...)Anyhow, this is a beautiful band. It will start off mirror-finish and will scuff up. Mine is now pretty scratched, both micro scratches and also rock-climbing on our honeymoon put larger, fuzzier scuffs on the ring. This can be refinished at any good jeweler, but I prefer the duller look. I don't like shiny-shiny. That felt too feminine.At this point, I obviously have to keep this-very-ring because it was ""at the ceremony,"" and yes, I am very proud of it, but if I could do it all over again I'd scrap the comfort fit bulgy-ness and get a lighter, flatter 14k gold ring, purely for comfort issues. 18k gold is heavy!Remember, you will be wearing this the rest of your life.

I noticed the prices were significant at places like Helzberg, being $400 plus, often $500 or more for a ""substantial"" ring, a price I was unable to pay.In any event, I decided I would try this ring.Something to note is that once you go from size 10 to 10.5, they add an ""extra"" 1mm to the ring. So, it goes from 8mm to 9mm. Of course, you are paying additional for the additional metal, but it does make the ring a little more substantial top to bottom once you hit 10.5. I am an 11 so I ended up with a ""9mm"" ring in my basket.I received the ring today and it's a beauty! HEAVY! Wow, my hand has a whole new heft to it, it feels like. This is MUCH MUCH heavier than the thin 14k squared ring I was sent as above. This ring is pretty hefty. Most anyone would be proud of it.On the inside it's stamped with the obligatory ""18k"" but also a little infinity symbol, which I thought was a little ""spiritual"" touch to what is most likely a wedding band for the majority of buyers.The ring sits higher above the finger, so it has a profile and height. It is not like a thin little band that hugs your skin. On me, those looked positively feminine. I hated them and that is why I ran from round rings and wanted a more masculine square one.It slips on easily, is very comfortable to wear and slips off with a reasonable amount of wiggling and cajoling. In other words, perfect. True to size, yet even more comfortable than other rings I've tried. The comfort fit interior is very ""pillowy"" and smooth. Nice.The heft of this ring makes this a great compromise for me, and the PRICE is FANTASTIC!! Feels like one of those $500 gold rings for much less. THANK YOU, AMAZON!UPDATE:Oh man, heaviness is a blessing and a curse. I have now gotten married and have worn this ring for a month now. I sort of wish I'd have gotten a lighter band. I still feel this thing weighing down my finger, i.e. the sensation hasn't ""deadened"" for me. Not a nightmare, not necessarily annoying, but just a little distracting point.Also, since this ring is comfort fit and ""puffs out"" (is rounded outwards) a little both on the inside and outside (it's not like a straight ""pipe segment""), I feel it on the first bone of my middle and pinky fingers when my fingers are together. A little annoying.Of course, I really wish there were no such thing as wedding bands to begin with, I've never really cared for rings! Why not a bracelet or tatoo?! (Half-joking here, and I digress...)Anyhow, this is a beautiful band. It will start off mirror-finish and will scuff up. Mine is now pretty scratched, both micro scratches and also rock-climbing on our honeymoon put larger, fuzzier scuffs on the ring. This can be refinished at any good jeweler, but I prefer the duller look. I don't like shiny-shiny. That felt too feminine.At this point, I obviously have to keep this-very-ring because it was ""at the ceremony,"" and yes, I am very proud of it, but if I could do it all over again I'd scrap the comfort fit bulgy-ness and get a lighter, flatter 14k gold ring, purely for comfort issues. 18k gold is heavy!Remember, you will be wearing this the rest of your life.

For various reasons I am attached to Medusa and the ideas she represents about strong, misunderstood, and misrepresented women, so I was very happy to find this on Amazon.

It is not as busy as most holiday pins, which is nice because it goes with every outfit and can be worn on any sweater or coat and I'm wearing mine everyday with everything! I believe it is prettier in person than the photo.Also, it is quality silver and a nice weight to it without being so heavy that it leans down. No fears of having this one bent by a seat belt because it is well-made with a good amount of metal.It is also a nice size, not too big, not too small and the design is classic. In person, it just looks like a pretty brooch from afar, upon closer inspection you realize it is a poinsettia. All holiday pins should have such understated elegance.

Now, all my craft stuff is in one place and easily usable when I want to work on a project.Assembling it was relatively simple.

I wear them a lot, cause they are comfortable to put on and off and also to style. I get lots of compliments for them. I already have them for more than 8 months and they seem fairly sturdy. Once note though, need care when handling as the wire that holds them together can get a little worn and the earrings can look a little lopsided, so once in a while need to be re-shaped them by hand (easy to do).

17210,"I bought these earrings as a lightning deal special last November. I've been very satisfied with them. Size-wise, the external diameter of the earring is pretty much identical to that of a US nickel ($.05) coin. I laid one of the earrings on top of a nickel coin, and when I lined up the bottom of the earring with the edge of the coin, the fastener wire at the top extended just a bit beyond the edge of the coin - at the open end, not the hinge end.I like the feel of these earrings; they aren't too heavy to be comfortable to wear, but they are substantial. They present a nice profile from the front.I've worn them a few times a week for three or four months now, with no problems at all. The fasteners seem to be a little hard to snap shut, but I like that because it means they are not likely to come unfastened accidentally. And they haven't come undone by accident, unlike other hoops with similar closures, which have sometimes been slipped open by contact with a scarf or coat collar.UPDATED on June 30, 2012: These earrings are still one of my go-to wardrobe mainstays. I wear them at least three days a week, and they are usually the only earrings I take when traveling. I have no idea if the quality of the earrings being sold now, is different from this pair that I bought two and a half years ago. However, my earrings (the 14k yellow and white gold version) are still going strong. The wire fasteners are still working well and the finish is clear and bright. I haven't abused these earrings but I haven't babied them, either. The price of precious metals has gone up since late 2009 when I bought these, and my budget's rather tight right now. If not for those two facts I'd be buying the all-yellow-gold version of these earrings in a heartbeat. For now, they are on my wish list.

They're about the size of a quarter and as you would expect have a nice shine and color to them. My wife loves them and wears them as her everyday earrings and sleeps in them with no problem. They seem to fit securely without falling out which used to happen with her old pair sometimes.She hasn't had any issues with the larger posts that I've seen mentioned in other reviews.Overall, a very good purchase.

17112,"I bought these earrings half a year ago and use it almost every day to work, they're sturdy and go well with most outfits. They're low maintenance as I haven't needed to bring out the jewelry cleaner for it, but they're still shiny anyway.

16539,"I bought these earrings last October 2007 and they are still my favorite earrings. They are indeed small, light weight, comfortable to wear and they have nice color and shine to them. I suspect they are hollow and at first I was not happy with that. But once I put them on and felt how comfortable they were, I was actually glad they were so light weight. I do not want to weigh down and stretch out my ear lobes with heavy ""every day"" earrings. Although they are light weight, they are still sturdy and well made. I even sleep in them and the clasp has never failed me. I have very long hair and they do not get caught up or entangled. I am very pleased with this purchase.

15808,"I bought these earrings more than a year ago and they have held up very well. They are dainty and just the right size in my opinion. They look great and I can wear them all the time.
",5
14182,"I bought these earrings over a year ago on Silver Insanity's website, when they were low on stock. They are perfect sized as I really don't like large bling earrings. These are kind of medium sized. They are sterling silver and come oxidized on purpose. The oxidation can be cleaned off if preferred that way with a polishing cloth, but it really adds a cool medieval look to these. These are pretty light weight and not very thick, so more on the thin side. They however last and they are not easily broken. The ear wires are stamped sterling, but the snake is NOT stamped (is still sterling though). The only thing I have to mention is that the garnets are orange and not red. I have no way to verify whether the garnets are genuine, but garnets do come in orange shades, just most common is red. Garnets are considered semi- precious therefore I don't see why these couldn't possibly be genuine as there is only a tiny piece of the stone inside the silver work.

14850,"I bought these earrings to go into a second piercing I have in my ears. They mixed wonderful with the other set I have in and are small enough to be pretty but not overwhelming. I thought they might be a bit too big but are wonderful for standard posts or for the alternate piercing that doesn't need changed often. The packaging of the product and the arrival was efficient and timely. I am very satisfied with the product and the response I received from the company. I will order from them again.

17600,"I bought these for a girlfriend for her birthday, and they were/are nice quality. The gift box was a little different-looking, and very pretty for a gift presentation. They are a good size, but not too large, and the green jade color was excellent. They were so green, in fact, that I thought they might be treated or dyed in some way. I especially like that they are a simple, non-traditional jade piece, not asian-looking, with dragons or symbols. My friend likes them a lot too, and thinks I have good taste!

They aren't too showy and add a nice bit of flair to his cuffed shirts (without being too dressy). They look really great with jeans! He doesn't get too much use out of them as he often opts for his Tiffany & Co. links instead, but I personally prefer the styling of these, especially with casual outfits.

She has silver hair, and the white gold is very pretty on her. I was stunned by the beauty of these earrings. They are small enough to look elegant, but are by no means bashfull. The quality is obvious. The impact is gorgeous. Mom went completely bananas. Thank you for the simply perfect gift for my Mom.

19753,"I bought these for my mom for her birthday. She knows jewelry, and she loved these. She said she had never seen such clear peridot before. She was very surprised that I bought them from Amazon. She and I did not know you could get such quality jewelry from Amazon. They are the perfect size for a second piercing. I have enjoyed every piece I have bought from Amazon. Their customer service is excellent and free shipping is very quick.

14972,"I bought these for my wedding. I had a hard time finding any decent clip-on earrings but these are beautiful and look more expensive than they are. I didn't end up wearing these as I found some dangly ones somewhere else, but I'm still glad I got these as I will get more use out of them. They are a little bigger than I thought they were, and a bit heavy for wearing for long periods, but then I'm not used to wearing earrings either.

16300,"I bought these for my wife because we agreed to not buy each other gifts this year so that we could save money for our home downpayment. I wanted to get her something that was nice, but inexpensive anyways (and break our agreement). I liked these because they matched a black & white diamond necklace I bought for her a few years back. At the price I didn't expect much, but hoped they would at least be presentable. I was pleasantly surprised. The quality is excellent. Though obviously not to the standard of a true swarovski piece or other fine jewelry, it holds it own very well and is among her favorite costume pieces. I had to show her what I paid for it to prove I didn't splurge. She thought they were worth much more than what I paid.
",5
14312,"I bought these for my wife for a Christmas Present along with three other pairs of earrings. Even though these cost less than the other pairs, she gravitated to these immediately. They are very attractive and are big enough that they make a statement. Buy them; you won't be sorry.

19761,"i bought these for myself and when i got them, i was really pleased with the craftmanship and the gems - clear and have a good sparkle. i wear them everyday although i am always afraid i would lose one or both because the post-friction-backs are too small. i often tighten and re-tighten them just to make sure. but i think they are quite secure. overall, a good value product.

13695,"I bought these for myself for my birthday, and must say they are perfect. They aren't too big to wear everyday. And they don't just blend in.
",5
17281,"I bought these for myself when on special. I like the depth and detail of the crossing hoops.They are of good quality, shine, and construction. I have a bit of difficulty getting them on as there is a tilt upward curve to the post at the end, but that is not enough to keep me from wearing them. The posts snap into a catch, so they are secure and I do not worry about losing one, as has happened with other earrings. Once on, they are comfortable to wear, and not too heavy in spite of their substantial visual weight. The earrings add a bit of sparkle and contrast against my dark hair, and balance well with my height. But they are not so big that they would look too heavy on someone shorter. I think they are perfectly sized.They go well with gold and silver jewelry individually, and mixing both, as is done currently in fashion.I would recommend them to anyone looking for versatile jewelry, and good quality at an affordable price.

16581,"I bought these last year. As soon as I got them, I put them on right away and I haven't taken them off since! these are the only earrings I've ever had that has not irritated my ears even once.

14810,"I bought these pearls to replace a strand I recieved as a gift from my father and were lost. I would never tell my dad this, but these pearls are much nicer than the ones he got for me. They are round, but slightly flat on each side, so they fit together on the strand tightly. The enamel and luster of the pearls are also very impressive. Suitable to wear at work (in an office) and still classy enough to wear with a nice dress.

17288,"I bought these the first week of December as a birthday present for a co-worker. Her birthday was the last week of December so I was very worried that I wouldn't receive this item in time! Boy was I wrong! The cartouche arrived in a couple weeks, beautifully packaged and quite well made! The best part was the price (around $40) which was significantly cheaper than other vendors were offering at the time. Again, I was a bit concerned, but I have to say I was extremely pleased with the vendor and this purchase! I would definitely order from them again...if I only knew someone else looking for a silver cartouche!

12527,"I bought these to try and replace an older pair that I lost which had been very special to me and my fiance, so I wasn't sure I would be pleased with them as my standards were high. I absolutely love these already, they are so shiny and smooth. The item picture does them no justice. I am very happy I chose these ones. So pretty :)

16220,"I bought these while searching for ""white gold"" tanzanite earrings. These look very beautiful with a tanzanite pendant that I already had so I wear these instead of the tanzanite earrings! I have owned them for over a year and they still sparkle beautifully.
",5
13040,"I bought this a couple years ago, actually. But it's withstood the whole time. It still looks as beautiful as it did when I first got it. This is an amazingly detailed wolf pendant that any wolf lover should get (it would also be an excellent gift for a loved one who loves wolves). I wear this everyday, and this is the only one of my three pendants I wear when I wear my dress clothes (for interviews and such). This was the first necklace I started wearing (I'm a guy and was in high school when I got it), and my mom was surprised when I asked her to buy it for me, but she did so, and she's been impressed that it's held up so well and that I wear it everyday. I'd recommend this to anyway!
",5
12880,"I bought this after a weekend of work around the house, having some dirt under my nails that literally had to be dug out lifting part of the nails ever so slightly. Do that for 30 minutes and you are in some pain, for several days actually. Remembering when I was in college helping a jeweler friend of mine we used one of these machines to clean our hands and jewelry after polishing rings so I went looking for one of these. I settled on this one, not sure why now, but over the last few months it has helped get all the dirt out from under my nails, no more detaching the cuticle. It is fantastic.For good measure my wife threw some of her jewelry into the machine and it came out sparkling. She is happy and so am I.For those of you that are handy around the house, pick this little baby up for your significant other for her birthday or Christmas, and you both benefit. For the lady of the house, reverse logic here, give it to him to clean his fingers and clean your jewelry too.
",5
15691,"I bought this alittle over a year ago & LOVE it! I wear it with a slightly longer snake chain with a pendant & they look awesome together. This would also be great on its own though. I've had it on almost everyday since I bought it & it looks just as it did on day one! Can't go wrong with this chain. Pretty, shiny, sturdy, nice weight.
",5
15412,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother. It was absolutely lovely. The price was right, the shipping was fast. Will definitely continue doing business with this company. My only complaint is that the chain was a little tangled when we opened it, but that was easy to fix. Very pretty piece of jewelry.
",5
18606,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Sister-in-law. It came in a very nice box. It looked to be a good quality. I've seen her wear it a couple times. Sometimes jewelry looks much better in the pictures, but in this case it's much prettier in real life. It's rather shiny, and the pictures have to hide that in order to show the detail. One thing I didn't notice in the picture, but did on the real one, is the kids hands/bodies/feet, make a second heart in addition to the one the whole family's arms make.

18680,"I bought this as a college graduation gift for my oldest daughter because I wanted to give her something special and personal. I wasn't sure if she would like it, she is funny about different types and sizes of jewelry. Being she had been a foster mother for two sisters and then officially adopted them in 2010 I thought I would take a chance. Well, she loves it and she said she was never going to take it off. It really means so much to her because she is so grateful for her new family. The pendent is more beautiful in person than the picture. If you are thnking of getting something unique and personal as a keepsake this is the perfect gift.

57838,"I bought this as a gift and was wondering how it would look up close, it was amazing, the look of the stone, the width of the ring and the detail of the ring's crown all very nice, it is sleek and sexy, if feels almost weightless, but the sterling silver is solid, and strong. the stone's look was a beautiful and deep navy blue with aqua blue mix within it. The Clauda is strong and lasting.

The next time I visited she wanted to show me the stand with her earrings in it. I was amazed at how many pairs it held and thought it looked very pretty sitting on her dresser. I got the black one. It's sturdy and looks really nice. She's really thrilled with this item... I'm thinking that I want to buy one for myself!

19050,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She said it was extremely beautiful and that it came in a beautiful box and velvet bag. She has not taken this pendant off since she has received it. I just recently seen it upon her visit. I agreed that it is elegant and delicate and very beautiful piece of jewelry. The only thing is : that the pendant looks more clear than Aquamarine next to the body. If you hold it up in the light then you can see the Aquamarine color. Again it is worth the price of this beautiful piece of jewelry.Debbie

6,"I bought this as a graduation gift for my daughter. She wanted a ring to remind her of her college completion without having a ""class ring"". She also requested a wide band. When I ordered it, I thought that it would do until I found something ""nicer"". That changed when the ring arrived. The picture does not begin to do it justice. It is a beautiful ring, elegant and feminine without having a ""little girl"" look. And, as lovely as it was in the box, it looks 100 times better on her hands. The only caveat I have is to order a larger than normal size. My daughter wears a size 5 ring but wide bands usually do better with a larger ring. I ordered a 6 and it fits perfectly. Final notes: The shipping was fast and the presentation (box) is beautiful as well.",5
14139,"i bought this as a joke. last year i fooled my sister with a fake tongue ring this year a nose ring. she's a flight attendant so i thought the airplane was a good choice. it's small and comfortable to wear. It has good detail to it also. i can't wait to use it on her!

14273,"I bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace I had seen at the Smithsonian Institute. I love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi-strands of this design - this combination truly illuminates my evening wear. By far, the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court. With so much class it is still affordable. This necklace is an exceptional gem.

It has a lobster clasp, which I prefer. It arrived on time, packed well, and in a lovely box. I am extremely pleased with the value for the money. Although I usually like to deal with merchandise sold directly by Amazon, I will definitely buy from this vendor again.
",5
13282,"I bought this as a set with the necklace and I would not have if I hadn't had a gift certificate. Not that it wasn't pretty, because it was. It makes a nice gift but I think it is on the pricier side for what you are getting. They are quite lovely but above the price point that I would have assigned to them - that was definitely determined after I had them in my hand. It was only a guess from the picture. I do like the multi-color.

17766,"I bought this chain for my son's Marine Corps cross. It matches beautifully and is solid and durable enough to withstand the rigors of his work in the Marine Corps. It is really a gorgeous chain of excellent quality, and the seller couldn't have been easier to deal with - fast shipping, nicely packaged, easy transaction. I would definitely purchase from them again.
",5
18050,"I bought this chain for myself, an adult, because I wanted a chain that was short enough so that the pendant I wanted to put on it would rest right at the hollow of my throat. I was nervous that it would be too small for my neck, so I wound up purchasing a 16"" chain just to be on the safe side, but the 14"" chain was absolutely perfect. So yes, adults (women, at least) can definitely purchase this chain for themselves, too!

Just today, I stumbled upon this on Amazon. I'm so excited. I have a lot of earrings and this makes it really easy to find the pair that I want.

15275,"I bought this for $19.99 as a Gold Box special because of the price. The picture above looks very washed out and does not do it justice. I just received it today and it is absolutely stunning, not washed out like the picture above. I came back here to see what the price was, to perhaps buy more to give for Christmas gifts. At $29.99 it would be worth buying again for myself if I didn't already have it, but since Xmas is so far off I will wait for something similar in the Gold Box and buy 10 of them. The blue is gorgeous. I wish I had gotten it in the purple color as well.

She is completely enchanted by it and will turn it on just to listen to it as she plays. She will also stare at it for long periods of time and I often wonder what is going on in her imagination as she hums along to it. It is very well made. Honestly, I was expecting something very low quality for this price, but was VERY surprised by how lovely it is. I would absolutely buy it again. I would recommend this item to any little girl with an active and lovely imagination.

The ring was lost one cold day when he was raking leaves. We think the ring went into a trash bag, never to be seen agin.That is my fault though so I say to please get sized to ensure proper fit. Obvious advice but still good.I loved the dragon silhouette. It's nice looking in it's simplicity and you can still tell what it is. I say a great buy for dragon lovers at a great price.

14726,"I bought this for my seven year old daughter for Christmas and she was quite pleased with it. It is compact once you open it up, so the space for the photos is small- maybe a half-inch diameter inside. For a larger person you might opt for the next bigger size pendant, so you can better view whatever photos you put in there. Whoever wrote that it didn't come with a chain was misinformed - it does.

They have a vermeil version for more money, but I'm happy with this one... leaves more money for diapers.

It is very good quality, a very attractive design, and looks great on a dresser with all the earrings displayed. I want one now! As does my other daughter. Great purchase. This item would be extremely attractive for a retail display as well. It's eye-catching and provides great organization for a large number of earrings.

14083,"I bought this item for my friend last Christmas (b/c she loves owls). First, it was shipped in a very timely fashion (I was able to give it to her well before Christmas). Second, the detail and beauty in such a small item suppased the price I paid. They are cute, dainty, detailed and very well made. An excellent gift!

13673,"I bought this item hoping for the best and I got it. It is very sparkly yet not gaudy due to its delicate size.

",5
17326,"I bought this item off Amazon after looking at a very similar one in Macy's. This necklace was half the price compared to the department store. The Necklace is very delicate but has good substance to it. It is suitable for small pendants. It has a ring hook clasp that works just fine and is stamped with 14K. When the chain catches the light it has a sparkle/shimmer to it. I am very pleased with this item. I was extra pleased to discover that it was made in the USA.
",5
18915,"I bought this jewelry box for my 3 year old daughter who is amassing a large collection of play jewelry. As of now I have it all in a random box just to keep it all together. Having had one of these jewelry boxes as a little girl, I thought my daughter should have one too. I know she will love it because it's silvery outside with pink inside and it's cute and girly and has fairies all over it. She will also get a kick out of the music and twirling dancer. The jewelry box is sturdy and very cute. I got it very securely packaged and it is in perfect condition, ready for me to wrap for Christmas. Very happy with my purchase - it was a good price too! Thank you!

18933,"I bought this jewelry box for my teen sister. After searching thru many ""pretty"" and ""girly"" boxes, I settled on this shiny box because its similar to the ballerina one I received on my 15th birthday. This pretty musical jewelry box is worth the tiresome search. She loved the dainty prettiness of the box and the Swan Lake song! Mind you this is a Slipknot and Avenge Sevenfold fan!!The box is made of cheap materials but it was made with great care and precision. It's a cute little jewelry box/large trinket box and the mirror, rotating fairy, and song are what I expected for the price.

15196,"I bought this necklace around 2 years ago, maybe more. I wear it every single day and it is not even close to breaking. I absolutely love it! The beads are all the same size, and the color is amazing! This picture does not do the beads justice, they are much, much prettier then that. The lock still holds the same way it did years ago and it had a chain at one end so it's size is adjustable. I take it off before every shower so I'm not sure how the sterling silver would hold in water, but I highly doubt it'd be a problem. Overall one of the best necklaces I have ever purchased. The shipping was fast and the packaging was great. It came in a small blue bag which I still have and use to keep other jewelry. I would definitely buy this again, either for myself or as a gift.
",5
15635,"I bought this necklace at F.Y.E the other day and I'm totally in love with it! It's one of the best Bleach products out there and it seems to look like that cross in the show. The only thing is that the chain looks breakable so don't buy if your rough with jewelry. But other then that I love it and wear it all the time also it's very pretty. It's a must have for every Uyru fangirl. :D
",5
17168,"I bought this necklace for my daughter,Aimee, who is having her first child after 7 years of marriage. The inside smaller middle heart signifies the baby that she is carrying inside of her, the large heart is for Aimee (who is dearly loved by everyone) - the one on the right is her love for ""Zachary"" after he is born and the left is her love for her husband which will make their family complete.

57854,"I bought this necklace for my grandma for Christmas. She has 5 kids, plus spouses, 10 grandkids plus spouses, and 7 great-grandchildren, and between all of us, our birthdays cover all the months of the year. We put all 12 stones in, representing all of her family. I also typed up and included a list of the months with each person's name for her. She absolutely LOVES it!! She could not have been happier and wears it all the time.One note though, I first ordered the small, not realizing it would not hold all 12 stones. So I had to return that one and get the large. The cutomer who mentioned not being able to see the stones at the bottom of the locket probably should have ordered the small.
",5
18648,"I bought this necklace for my mom for Christmas, and she loves it! It comes in a pretty box with a certificate of family that you can sign on the back, and it is small but detailed.

",5
18519,"I bought this necklace to go with my renaissance wedding outfit. It matched perfectly and was the look that I wanted. It is made well and has clean lines. The celtic design in the silver work is just what I was looking for. The stone color is clear and a nice shade of peridot green - just like in the picture. The only fault it has with me is that I thought it would be a little bigger (I didnt really pay attention to the listed measurement - my fault). Its about and inch and a half-ish wide. Overall I really love it and would recommend it as a good buy.
",5
12411,"I bought this necklace to go with some earrings I bought for my daughter for Christmas...she loves it and wears it often.
",5
57930,"I bought this necklace to wear with my mother-of-the-bride dress. My dress is a deep amethyst color and I was worried that I might look too purple. The necklace is the perfect accessory. The pearls are beautiful--the colors change in the light. The toggle looks like it will stay closed, even while dancing. It really is simple, elegant and artfully crafted.
",5
17551,"I bought this necklace with the idea that I wanted something with celtic knotwork, and I wanted something cheap. This necklace serves both purposes. While it is not of the most fine quality piece of jewelry I own, I also didn't expect it to be when I paid only as much as I did for it. Two negatives about it: 1) the chain is very fine. If you are aware of that and you don't care, it shouldn't cause you any problems; and 2) The silver used to make the knotwork is very thin, so don't expect a heavy piece.All in all, I am very happy with my necklace. I got what I expected and I am very happy. If you want something cheap that looks nice, this necklace will suit you just fine.
",5
15383,"I bought this necklace, and although it's much smaller than I expected, I really love it. I am a goldfish fanatic, and it's just a really cute little charm. I like the chain included, it's really dainty and it shines. The company is great, and I will definitely order from them again. Thanks so much!
",5
15483,"I bought this on a whim but really enjoy the earrings, and get compliments when I wear them. The flag is a little smaller than I thought it would have been, but big enough to not be gaudy or tacky. I really like the knotted weave accent encircling the clovers.
",5
18035,"I bought this on deal and boy I felt like a queen when I put it on the first time. It's beautiful, and eye catching without being overwhelming. It drapes perfectly. The lobster clasp is a little stiff, so it's nice to have some one help put it on. It's well made, the colors are great. The only thing is, it tangles easily. It's packaged carefully so it wasn't too hard to straighten out when I first got it, and I have been very careful to untangle it every time I take it off. It needs to be stored hanging up, I think. Aside from that, I just love it.

I loved them....loved them so much that when I lost one down my sink drain, I wanted to buy another pair. I am currently waiting to receive my second pair. For the price and the beauty, why not! No one will know they aren't real diamonds.

I've always heard that one habit would have to be replaced by another; a likely key to past failed attempts.This ring has surpassed my expectations. I leave it on day and night including showers and hand washing. It still looks great and hasn't tarnished a bit. I just ordered additional ones for a friend and for my daughter.This ring is wider than what I usually wear, so I'd advise ordering one size larger than you normally wear.

I showed my guy his ring and he loved it too.If you want it custom made, talk to them about it and they will do it! I wanted the ring to be white gold and the diamonds to be a little bit larger and they did it. It looks stunning. I will definitely be shopping with them again.
",5
13628,"I bought this ring as a wedding band to go with my wife's engagement ring. When I opened the box there was a ""wow"" moment. It was just the right ring and it looks beautiful next to the engagement ring. It also comes in a handsome box. I was a little skeptical about buying a ring like this on Amazon but the easy return policy made it worth it. We bought the wrong size initially but returned it for the correct one. The total cost was only the return shipping (about 3 dollars). We would have spent more than that driving around to jewelry stores trying to find something as nice and it probably would have been more expensive. The most important thing is that my wife loves it. I catch her looking down to her finger pretty often.
",5
13135,"I bought this ring as a wedding ring for my husband 3 years ago. He still gets compliments on this piece. I wanted to choose a wedding band that was different from all the plain gold bands I see men wearing. I also wanted it to be a surprise, so I did all my shopping online at work. As my budget was limited, I did quite a bit of looking around before making this purchase. I was not disappointed. He paid more for my wedding ring in a store, but his ring is much heavier, and the diamonds more clear than the ones in my ring. I was pleasantly surprised. When I make my next fine jewelry purchase, I won't hesitate to buy from JewelryDays.

It's beautiful, shiny, and the little turquoise wolves are cute, nicely shaped, and pretty as well.Someone in an earlier review said that the rings run a little small. Well I didn't have that problem. I got my ring and it fits perfectly!The only downside of this ring is that I've found it turns my finger green - which means the metal contains copper. Not a big deal, but I like when my rings don't turn my fingers weird colors.Overall: 5 of 5 stars for a beautiful piece of jewelry that is a work of art!Follow up: 12.25.10: The ring stopped turning my finger green once I wore it for a while.

It actually has the little laser clusters at every quarter of the ring, top, bottom, left and right. In a little light, they actually shine like a small diamond is in there. Also, the sterling silver is of supreme quality. Because it has a matte finish it actually has the appearance of white gold, not silver. I love the detailing and it's comtemporary design - exactly what I was hoping for. Peora's service was very fast also - I received my ring 4 business days after I ordered it. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you Peora!

12881,"I bought this to clean and maintain an antique diamond ring. It was filthy to say the least. Caked on grunge.I placed it in the tank with the plastic basket, and let the machine do its work at the longest time setting. It softened the gunk enough that I could use a stiff brush to work it all out of the crevices. I added two drops of Dawn Detergent to the water (per the instructions), and it cleaned it up pretty well. It looks like new.I was concerned about the diamond chip on the sides, but they were fine. The sonic waves are really gentle. The only complaint? They need to use better glue for the rubber feet.

I also work at a hospital so I wash my hands about a hundred times in the day and no issue. My mother said it was shipped promptly and that the ring was secure in the box (which is also very nice)

12865,"I chose to purchase this product because 2 other family members of mine have had theirs for years. I do know that the one issue they have had with this was that after a while the lid broke off (but that doesn't effect the product). I use the connoisseur brand cleaner refill in my jewelry cleaner and am very happy. I have tried so many other cleaners in the past (including sonic cleaners) and they just don't work.

15123,"I collect crosses, and many are not half as pretty as this one. It has a very antique look to it, and is very different. I am glad they put some lighter blue stones in it along with the dark blue ones. Otherwise, it would be too dark considering the metal has a dark-antique look to it. For the price, it was one of my best buys!

It is a really lovely piece, everything you would expect from the pictures and more. The photo doesn't show it well, but the necklace has a ""double chain"" that adds lots of personality to it. This eye-catching piece will be a great addition to any jewelry collection. Beautiful, perfect.

The design is really great; the ferrets are much more delicate than they appear in the picture above. The little tails curled around the lapis balls are just adorable.As the earrings are quite small, a girl (perhaps eight and up) could also wear these. Any age will find these adorable. I'd buy them if I was you! Thank you, Silver Insanity. I'll definitely be checking out more of your jewelry.

19583,"I decided to spend an extra dollar or two for this charm, hoping that it would be better quality than some of the others that were available. I am glad I did, because this charm is very nicely detailed. My wife was pleased with my purchase, so that made it all worth while.
",5
15,"I decided to write a review for this product as I've seen many reviews for items by this seller that were fairly contradictory. I am an avid fan of sterling silver and personally own over 100 rings (purchased from various sellers and artisans).Here is what I can tell you from my extensive experience: substantial sterling is expensive and shiny finishes scratch no matter how careful you are.Taking that into account, I ordered this item with some trepidation- it seemed to be awfully cheap for real sterling, and it's very shiny.The sterling is somewhat thin, HOWEVER it is not as thin as I was expecting it to be. It does not bend with normal usage. I even squeezed it onto a larger finger and then did some tugging to get it back off and the ring did NOT bend. That is a decent thickness for the price.I also wear many rings at the same time and have not found my rings to have scratched the surface of this one (yet).I have purchased rings from major retailers (when they were on sale they were about the same price as this) and the sterling was much flimsier and the surfaces easier to scratch.Added to the fact that it is well-made (solid, the scrollwork is not sticking out and the stone is not loose), the details charming, and the stone genuine, I can honestly say that I've NEVER FOUND A BETTER DEAL for a genuine sterling silver ring!I loved the ring so much that I have ordered several more and some other items from Silver Insanity.I am extremely satisfied with their products and find their prices excellent (reasonable and appropriate).These ""armor"" rings are a bit smaller than what some people may have been expecting but that is why you should read the specifications carefully and also the weight listings.I found that the 3 ""armor"" rings that I have purchased all reach to about 1 centimeter BEHIND my middle knuckle (as in, does not go past my middle knuckle).One note- the sizes seem a tad bit small- if you are a half size, order up!Hope this helps!
",5
16226,"I definitely didn't expect the quality of these earrings to be as great as they are, considering the price! The first thing you have to realize is that these are under twenty dollars! I bought them for my wife; one of MANY presents, including much more expensive jewelry. When she saw them she liked them quite a lot. I told her how much they cost me and she loved them even more! She was just looking for something cute that she could wear for day-to-day outings and this was exactly what she was looking for. This company's prices and products are a rare find in today's market. Remember: these aren't super high-end Swarovski Crystals, but they are quite simply AMAZING for the price.

16680,"I did a lot of comparison shopping online,department stores and jewelry stores. These earrings can't be beat. They are the perfect size I was looking for, they clasp securely and are very well made. They even come with a guarantee. I couldn't find a comparable pair for this price. I love Amazon.

18461,"I didn't order this necklace from Silver Insanity, but actually a vendor on eBay. This necklace comes from the Peter Stone company originally and I must say that all of their necklaces are genuine silver and high quality. I am very pleased with this piece and it is really intricately detailed. This is a larger dragon piece and just the right size. Not too big, not too small and the workmanship on the silver is very nice. Doesn't look like a cheap piece for sure.

It took me FOREVER because I'm so picky. I wanted a unique looking ring that wasn't too outstanding, bold, looked cheap, or flashy.

15046,"I first found, and bought, this ring in a booth at a large 'biker' event - Bikes, Blues and Barbeque - a fe years ago. I'd been wanting a ring for some time, but never found anything that appealed to my tastes - masculine but not gaudy or overbearing/overlarge. I've gotten numerous compliments on it from strangers....and was sad to let it go when a lady-friend asked for it as a keep-sake (lol).I missed it and wanted to replace it, but was skeptical that I could find anything that fit 'me' so well. I began searching Amazon under men's rings..and I was thrilled when I found the exact ring here.This ring actually even sparkles - glinting off the edges - in sunlight. I gave one to my best frined for his birthday the other day and his wife and daughters love it on him.

This neclace helped keep my clean for my first 30 days buy reminding me that there are people in the NA family who do care about me. Now I have gotten one for my sponsor as a thank you gift and I am sure she will love it as much as I do. If you or someone you know is in NA and working hard to stay clean and sober, I recommend getting this neclace. It means so much more than you will ever know without it.

14164,"I found this while shopping for a little ankle bracelet to wear this summer with my capris and sandals. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but also wanted something that wouldn't break from normal wear. This silver anklet turned out to be perfect.Because of it's design, it rolls smoothly on the leg, and there no design or charm to get flipped over or off center. I have been wearing mine for a week straight, through shopping, working, showers, sleeping, etc, and it hasn't fallen off or broken yet.It comes in several sizes, which I appreciate. Nice size 11 anklets are often hard to find. I also plan to pick this up in a 10 inch, since the 11 inch sits low on my foot (which is how I like to wear them with sandals and I would also like one that sits higher for when I'm wearing tennis shoes.)Highly recommended for anyone looking for a low maintenance, good quality, highly affordable anklet that comes in a nice variety of sizes.*** I have added a more detailed picture of this anklet to the Amazon images at the top of this page to give a better view of how it looks when wearing it. ***

The amount of detail is admirable as well; it is small enough to be noticeable but discreet. Overall it looks quite delicate but considering it isn't involved in anything strenous, it should be fine.

17361,"I got this for Christmas from my boyfriend and love it. I'm usually not into gold jewelry, but this is a very tasteful and adorable necklace. Perfect for the woman who you love despite her bad side. The chain is well made but very delicate, so if you expect that the wearer might need a stronger chain that's good to know.
",5
14572,"I got this for Christmas. The heart is very beautiful and the perfect size. The chain is really cute too, and although it gets dirty quickly (like all the other sterling silver jewelry)you can clean it to shine easily with a silver cleaner. I wear it all the time, and the size and shape of the heart make it a great, feminine accessory. I'm very pleased with it. The only thing I don't like is the box -- very dull looking, and too simple to encase this heart. So I thought about taking one star off the product, but since I was just rating the heart, I gave it 5.

I have bought those earrings before for a gift, and my friend was happy with it, so I thought it will work for my coworker; she loved it! It is shiny and feels comfortable to the ear. I saw that there is the bracelet online, too. Maybe I can buy that for my coworker for Christmas and make it a set for her. I will recommend those earrings for every day use, but they also work well for going out, too!

17350,"I got this for my girlfriend for our one-year anniversary, and she loved it! It's a quality piece of jewelry, and a clearly awesome design.

It is nice in that it is fairly simple but still different than a straight pearl necklace, not heavy, and well made.If you are looking at this necklace as a possibility, I can only say that we have been very happy with it, and my wife likes that it's different than what others have.

18686,"I got this for my wife, she absolutely loves it! Of all the pendants I've gotten her, this understandably is her favorite and of course the one she wears all the time. While I rate the pendant 5 stars, I rate the chain itself a 1.5 . Plan on using another chain or purchasing a separate one which I bought here on Amazon at what I thought was a great price. It's been a year now that she's had it and it still looks and holds up great, both the pendant and the separate chain I bought to go with it.

As soon as I saw this necklace I knew she'd love it and I was right, She totally did!She thought I spent way more than I did on this necklace, so I'm happy with the quality of the piece.
",5
17315,"I got this necklace as an exchange for a thinner, longer one. I love this. It is a perfect length to just be on me and not get in my way. It is still a thin chain, but thick enough to feel robust and solid. I have been sleeping and showering with it on for a week or so now with no problems. It is subtle and glittery, but not gaudy. I also have very long and fine hair, and it has not gotten tangled around the chain, even while sleeping with my hair down. I highly recommend this chain.

15949,"I got this necklace because lately the snake has become my totem animal and I wanted a reminder. This pendant is nicely detailed with diamonds alternating with a couple of bands of plain gold. It is delicate and not ostentatious at all, very classy.

17317,"I got this necklace for my granddaughter to use with a cross and it is perfect for a child. It is very pretty, delicate and has a &#34;sparkle&#34; due to the way the links are interwoven. For an adult it might be a bit thin.

",5
19389,"I got this pendant for my girlfriend and she loved it. It looks great on her, and although it is a very unique piece, she is asked by her friends where they can get one. She had a hard time giving them the source because she wanted to be the only one to have it, but her friends are pretty persistent. She has not worn it with a scented cloth, as it was intended, but it looks very nice as it is. No need to put anything in it.I highly recommend this piece, and I am very happy with the seller and Amazon.com for a wonderful transaction. This is my first review for anything I have purchased on Amazon, but that is how happy we are with this pendant and the seller's (Silver Insanity) service.

15379,"I got this ring as a gift. I love it because of its unusual and beautiful design. My only comment for those who are considering buying it is that the image makes it look bigger. It's not as big or thick as it looks in the picture. Very beautiful though.

I highly recommend Taos Trading and their products!

13936,"I got this to replace a necklace which I lost years ago, and I couldn't be happier. It is very pretty, dainty, and elegant, and the filigree work is very detailed for something so small. I am actually considering buying another for backup, because the price is so very good for the quality of it! I love it, I am so happy with it. Also Silver Insanity ships super fast, I got my order within two days of ordering!

12883,"I got this ultrasonic cleaner a few weeks ago and have only used it for cleaning the parts of fountain pens. Although it is not as powerful at cleaning things as I had hoped, I have no other experiences with these devices to compare it to. It is compact, attractively designed, and does indeed clean things efficiently. I do recommend that you exercise caution with whatever jewelry you might place in the cleaner because these machines will loosen different kinds of glue or adhesives or bits of plating that are already flaking.
",5
19204,"I got tired of a crowded jewelry box, looking for a matching set and forgetting what I hadn't worn in some time. With this Acrylic Holder, all the ""dangle"" earrings are on display and easy to get at. It does not take up much space and yet does hold 37 pairs of dangle-drop or regular pierced earrings. The three rows are staggered so you can see what's there and are easy to get out, without dropping, if you go slowly. I can see where if you do drop one it might be a bit difficult to reach, but either a long pair of tweezers or an old crochet hook should scoop it up okay. The two bottom drawers will hold a few necklaces or your watch or just more earrings. I think this is a really handy way to keep them together and it's fun to see the ones I'd forgotten that I had and wear them more often. Good deal!

14272,"I got two of these for frog loving friends and they loved them. Sturdy, petite, but still able to see its a frog.
",5
13676,"I gotta admit it. After reading the reviews I still was skeptical, but this little bracelet is exactly as described and as appears in the pic. It is delicate, but NOT cheap looking. The length is good. The clasp is one of those lock on clasps that you always get with expensive bracelets. This gives it more credibility that it is real. Hey, what girl doesn't want to show off a pretty sparkly piece of jewelry that looks like the real deal....AND not pay much for it. At this price, treat yourself!
",5
14607,"I gotta say, I'm very impressed at this necklace. I'm a 26yo guy that knows virtually nothing about jewelry, but this necklace exudes high quality. It has little ""Italy"" stamps on the necklace, which I like. I returned the first necklace I bought on here, and this one is 100% better.

16056,"I had added these to my wishlist and forgotten about them when I received them as a gift. They are beautiful and came in a small bag tucked inside of a small box. It was a great presentation for a gift. I love wearing these with all types of outfits. They aren't too dressy to wear with jeans or to casual to wear to a formal event. I love the versatility of these earrings. The only thing that gets a little annoying is that the chain that dangles in the middle sometimes get wrapped around the larger swirly part. It doesn't hurt the earrings, but just looks a little silly if you don't fix it. I still give them 5 stars!

The company was very efficient and I received the cross quickly.

After visiting several jewelry stores and finding nothing that I liked that was under $300, I went online and B-I-N-G-O, there it was on Amazon. I ordered the ring and received it within a week. I love it and could kick myself for wasting so much time going from one jewelry store to another.

57940,"I had been searching for an open heart ring in white gold for quite along time before I came across this ring! I even went into a jewelry store to see what it would cost to make one. It was ridiculous! So one day I searched through amazon and found this lovely ring. At first I just wanted a plain open heart ring, I never thought of a diamond accent. Well it ended up I purchased it on sale and I was surprised that the diamond accent does sparkle! I purchased this ring one year ago and I have worn it every day since. It still looks as the day I received it! I wont be surprised if it does eventually get a yellow tinge because all white gold eventually does. I am extremely happy that I found this ring!
",5
16981,"I had been shopping around for some white gold ball studs for some time when I came across these. I have very sensitive ears (I can't even wear sterling silver) so I was looking for a quality product. I had read all the reviews and was concerned with the complaints of the posts being too short and the product being made cheaply. I have had these in my ears for about a month straight. I have left them in for showers, exercising several days each week, and sleep. They have not fallen out and they still look amazing as they did when they first arrived. I will say that when they arrive, be CAREFUL when removing the tag from the backing of the earring. I tugged a little too hard and bent the backing, but it was easily bent back into place. One could say that this is a defect, but it's gold, it's small, and it's fragile; just be careful! I would suggest cutting the tag off with scissors instead of pulling it off. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and I love these earrings.

Thanks for helping to make a birthday special. The copper ones look almost real but shiny! Thanks.
",5
15168,"I had heard of the Sajen mark of quality. But, the designs have always been too ornate for my taste - until I was fortunate enough to have found this beautiful ring. It is a lovely shade of purple with a magnificent cut. The size is large, about a 1/2"" to 3/4"" from top to bottom (and I like to wear a big ""statement"" ring on my right hand, despite my petite frame.) The design was refreshingly streamlined with no unnecessary flowers or squiggles. There is an extremely generous amount of silver used. The stone is well protected on all four sides (I know because I accidentally dropped it in the sink - no damage at all!) The thick band in the back makes it extremely comfortable, and I am not afraid to do work while I wear it.Here is one case where the ring is nicer than it's picture. I can only suggest, from my experience, to order a 1/2 size up. My particluar ring was tight and had to be worn on an undesignated finger. I really didn't mind! Sajen, ""Please design a few more pieces that are as streamlined as this - I had been looking for an amethyst ring like this for a very long time."" Thank you!

19230,"I had seen this company's music boxes before but didn't want to pay full price, especially for something I hadn't seen first-hand. I found an amazing price here on this box and bought one as a keepsake for my baby girl. The music is clear and a good volume, the pictures on it are bright and beautiful just like what I saw online, the mirror is clear and not distorted, and the horse inside is plastic and is on a spring - and that's a good thing for little ones! You can't see it, but there is another drawer on the back and the little drawers on the sides are deep so, even though the box is not very big, there is more storage than there appears to be. My two 3-year olds love this box and couldn't stop opening and closing the lid and all of the drawers. They weren't especially gentle but it didn't seem fragile. I am very pleased with the quality of this box and I would have felt that I had gotten my money's worth even if I had paid a higher price.

19350,"I had this cuff for a while and definitely like it a lot.

I was very pleased to see that the jaw on the clip is deep enough that I can wrap the chain around it therefore shortening it, but leaving it long in case I want to use it that way.

You can find them all over and get a great deal on them (under $50), so keep an eye out (though I cant speak for quality, so judge individually for yourself). People think that mother of pearl has to cost a fortune, but it is widely available and the round cut of these earrings really show off its best features.If you do get these earrings, there is only one precaution I would take...you cant wear these with everything and they can washout some complexions if youre not careful, so make sure that they work with your outfit and makeup. Sometimes I find they look brilliant and other times, its just not happening. These earrings arent for everyday if you ask me. They're for a nice dinner or an important meeting where you want to look 110%.I'm sure that these will be one of your most prized pieces of jewelry! What a bargain!

I thought it would be better to get her one of her own since she's still small and continue the tradition. She loves watching the little fairy twirl around while she pulls out her fake jewelry to put on. It's very nice quality for a child's jewelry box.

17072,"I have been hunting all over for a distinctive two tone (yellow & white)chain for a two tone diamond pendant. I do not like flimsy chains and wanted a substantial chain that would be secure for my diamond pendant. I preferred a gram weight of a least 8 grams. This chain came in at 9.1 grams. It has three chains (2 WG snake and 1 YG bead) wrapped around each other. You can see the individual gold colors on each chain. However, the online description lacked this specific information. The chain is the best I have found. It would be great as a necklace all by itself without a pendant. Delivery was outstanding. Nice jewelry pouch, too.

12120,"I have been incredibly pleased with these earring and they have now become my ""every day"" earrings - insured at the replacement value, which is far more than the actual cost. One problem is that the back fits better on one earring and I can get it tighter on my ear than the other but at no time do I feel that I am going to lose the one that is slightly loose.I love the shine, the brilliance, the glow and the great feeling they give me. I have received numerous compliments on these earrings and my heart is happy. These were a present to myself for havig dealt with a bad situaiton for over two years and survived. Everyone needs to pamper themselves sometimes - this is a great way to do it.

16571,"I have been looking all over the internet to find a small gold hoop earrings, I saw these and read the reviews, some of the reviews stated that they were real small, so I kept looking around, but I kept coming back to this pair, so I decided to give them a try, besides if I did't like them I could always send them back,. I ordered them, and they were shipped in less than a week, and when I recieved them, exactlly what I was hoping for.I love them, as some of the other reviews stated. they are comfortable to wear day in, day out. Perfect for everyday wear. they are about 1/8 in diameter small than a dime, (they are not a huggie earrings) but has a nice thickness to them about 1/4&#34;. As I mention before a PERFECT everyday earring. If you are looking for a everyday pair of small earrings, these at it.

As a guy I was looking for a ring that would be very versatile and could match any style I was dressed. And I found it in this ring. It can match a dark suit for a formal event and even jean with holes in them at a rock concert. I really like this ring. I reccomend it proudly.

16583,"I have been looking for a pair of small gold hoops for quite some time and these are exactly what I have been looking for. I wanted something small in size but with a bolder look. They are small and lightweight which makes them very comfortable to wear. They are perfect for women with short hair; they are small but not too small to be seen.

16701,"I have been looking for an affordable pair of gold hoop earrings in a 2 inch size, and these are all I could ask for in a pair. I got them during a Gold Box sale at an awesome price for the pair. They feel really lightweight on, and fit right in with other jewelry I wear.As others have mentioned, treating them more like eternity hoops works better for the clasps. The only risk of doing it the other way is loosening the grip the post goes into. Very lightweight feeling on, but also very substantial (not as thin as I had expected). These are hollow gold.I definitely recommend them. If you are going for a stylish pop at the office or for going out and about, these earrings are great! It is easy to put them on, take them off, and they feel great on. For the size, again, just not too heavy on the earlobes.

16626,"I have been shopping around for 1"" 14K white gold hoops for a while. I was trying to keep the price under $100 and looked at many online sources. I bought a pair from Macy's for $89 that were very flimsy, not shiny, and basically junk. I had already bought a pair of Amazon Collection 1/2"" 14K white gold hoops and was very happy with them, but the only pair of 1"" hoops available at Amazon at that time had weird flat hammered ear posts that the reviews said were too wide for comfort. Then these earrings showed up with normal ear posts and I gave them a try.I am very pleased with these earrings. They are substantial (as substantial as a 2mm wide earring can be), the ear wires click solidly into and out of the clamp so I am not at all afraid of them falling out, and they are very shiny and pretty. They are true to size. Highly recommended for the $99 I paid.

I came back to order one more set as a present for my friend that lives in France and saw mine when I was visiting her for few days this year.

I am honestly very picky about my jewelry and my best friend used to work at a jewelry store and he loves it too.

19699,"I have bought many items from Silver Insanity for myself and my daughter. The service and quality were always five star. The Millefiori jewelry is expensive everywhere online. You can not find it cheaper than $30 for a piece like that anywhere. In fact, for a heart this size you are likely to pay closer to $50 elsewhere. I have seen many pieces that I paid for under $20 with Silver Insanity, sold much higher in the stores. I think their prices are shockingly cheap and allow me to indulge my 6 year old with high quality silver trinkets.

I was originally attracted to this anklet due to it's simple elegance. I find that I can wear it with pretty much any outfit and for any occasion without it looking out of place. It's very easy to take on and take off, but I usually forget it's on until someone comments about it.

14038,"I have just received my new earrings and so far I love them. The stone is really pretty and the stem of the earing is quite long which I personally like because the earring will stay on tight without coming close to pinching my ear.

I will post an update if they do indeed break.

12357,"I have looked at these earrings for a while. I have actually developed a collection now of turtles but I only buy the ones that really catch my eye. In other words, I can be choosy. Then again why not? A person wants to know that they will make use of their purchases and these little turtles do NOT dissappoint. In other words I am very pleased. Ironically, I have had the pendant which I thought looked quite similar. Now that I went ahead and purchased the earrings they are a perfect match. The only difference is the earrings are a little larger than the pendant. If these catch your eye, give them a try. I know they should bring you satisfaction. Shipped quickly by the way.

16340,"I have lost two expensive cross necklaces in the past two years so I decided to get this one since it was priced well and matches my wedding ring. Contrary to what other reviews say, I think it is the perfect size. The chain is a good length too. The cross sits just above the neckline of my shirts and looks great. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a pretty cross necklace that doesn't break the bank.

19252,"I have lots of small items with my jewelry and hobbies and wanted boxes to put them in. I saw these boxes and ordered them and they are the handiest things ever. The boxes fit easily in my closet, which is what I wanted. Out of sight for when the burglers come. They are also easily stored away in drawers or other locations if you are hiding, or putting things away. A great little item. I like it best because you can see through it and see what you have inside in all layers without opening drawers and having to dig around. They may seem pricey, but they are terribly heavy duty. I can open a drawer and leave it open, walk away and come back and it is right where I left it. The cat has not managed to nudge it apart and it has not slid apart because it is just junk. These things will be around doing a Good job long after I am gone. Hopefully, my children will have the sense to see that they are one of the doodads that mom has that might be of some use. All the bouhaha aside, they are nice, nice acrylic boxes and I suggest them over the others I have seen.

The important thing in all hoops is to find the right size and width first. Good thing I read other reviews about the snap lock closure though or else I might have had a problem. These have a nice shine to them and are very pleasing to the eye. At first glance I didn't think these would be noticeable on but they are and very simple yet elegant. Another important factor is that they are light. I will be wearing these frequently. Great buy!!! Thanks Amazon.

Every once in a while it seems to be a little tarnished (from body lotion, I believe) and all it takes is a quick swipe with a silver polishing cloth and voila ... as pretty as new!

So instead I am using it as a half pinky ring which looks so adorable I am even more pleased that it didn't fit as a toe ring. I LOVE this. The best part? If anything happens to it I can repurchase a new one. This isn't too thick nor is it too thin. It looks dainty and I absolutely couldn't be more thrilled with it. I do want to add I don't think it would be good for a man because it's thin so it's far too dainty for a man.

17071,"I initially purchased the 16 inch length of this necklace to wear with a white gold & yellow gold diamond pendant. I looked everywhere for a STURDY two tone chain with no luck. All I found was tinsel strength wisps of gold chains which I did not want. As the gram weight in this piece was perfect as a substantial chain for my pendant, I took a chance and it did not disappoint me. I loved it so much, I bought the 18 inch necklace and matching bracelet as well. I have received many compliments because of it being so different and unique.

18918,"I just bought this for my 2 1/2 year old who is very girly and wanted a jewelry box. It is much prettier than I expected and than it looks in the picture. I really love it, and so does she. It plays ""Swan Lake"" when you open the box and the fairy/ballerina turns around. I plan to get this for all of her friends for thier birthdays.

14994,"I just brought my ring in to get resized. I was given a 7 and had it brought down to a six. I have always loved my ring, because of its beauty, but I don't really know much about gold, or diamonds. I mean, I don't really know what makes a good diamond vs. a ""bad"" diamond. When I went back to pick up my ring, the jeweler told me that my ring is really well made. The diamonds are of great quality, and the band is top notch! I didn't really know how to respond, other than to say, ""thank you!"" He went on and on about how he loved my ring. It just surprised me because the last time my boyfriend bought me a ring, 6 years ago, (which I had to get resized, also), the same jeweler said to me, ""you know the diamonds aren't real, right?"" Haha. No, I didn't, but I still loved that ring. I didn't have the heart to tell my boyfriend. I got my ring as a Valentines gift, and it was a little big. My guy must have done a little jewelery research this time around. It is so beautiful; I didn't want to part with it. Not even for a couple of hours, to get it resized. I finally had to cave (9 months later), because my job requires me to work a lot with my hands, and I didn't want it to slip off and get lost. You will love this ring. The diamonds sparkle radiantly! The gold shines marvelously! It is stunning!

12508,"I just got my ring and I am really impressed with it. I've searched for a Marquise style ring set, but they are either way to expensive or look fake. This ring looks real and people can not tell the difference. My friends thought that I hit the lottery or something! The center stone is about 2 cts, but the setting makes the whole set believable.

16892,"I just got these the other day, and they're even more beautiful than I expected! I like smaller hoops, and these were the exact right size for me. Very shiny, lovely yellow gold shade (not brassy), and the closures are nice and secure. If you're looking for a lovely pair of small hoops, these are the ones for you! The price was very reasonable, and shipping was fast.... I'm very happy with this purchase!

13625,"I just got this from my husband for an anniversary gift. I love it! It is very beautiful and does not look cheap at all. The diamonds look great and sparkle in the light. We have a young baby now so I had been unable to wear my engagement ring which was a solitaire diamond ring since I did not want to scratch the baby. But I was feeling empty without a ring on my finger. This is a perfect replacement to wear until our baby is older and I can wear my original engagement ring again!
",5
14522,"I just got this in the mail today, and I am quite pleased. I had seen this bracelet several times and wanted to buy it except for the fact that it is advertised as only 7 inches long, which, for me is not loose enough - I usually wear 7.25-7.5 inch bracelets. This is the best-looking Hamsa bracelet out there, so I finally bit the bullet and bought it with the intention of adding an extender. However, when I got the bracelet and put it on, not only did it fit well, I had room like I do with the bracelet sizes I mentioned above that I prefer! So I would say that the length is incorrectly advertised. In fact, in measuring mine out, I am coming up with it being just shy of 7.5 inches, or about 18.9 centimeters. It really is a lovely bracelet, and yes, it's delicate, but I wouldn't say it's too fragile to wear. Just use some caution, but all in all, a good buy.
",5
18682,"I just got this necklace and I LOVE it. I wear it everyday and it is my favorite necklace. My family always says morning prayers together and it reminded me of me, my husband, daughter, and son holding hands and thanking the Lord for all of our blessings and for the great day we are going to have. I will definately be buying more from this seller. Necklace is also great quality..chain was just the right length and it's much more beautiful in person...the pictures doesn't do this charm justice. I'm probably going to be buying more of the family necklaces for gifts.

They are a great buy and so well designed and crafted.

I didn't think it was as oxidized as the picture, but it turns out I like it better just the way it is. It is a nice solid piece. The bracelet is 3/4"" wide (this is the width of the handcuffs) and mine measured 7 and 3/4"" long including the clasp, so I was very pleased with the extra 3/4"" that I wasn't expecting. I would definitely recommend this bracelet.

I like them because they look so unusual and will go well with my dark hair.

(clean with lemon juice!) I'll definitely be purchasing jewelry from this seller again, no question!

",5
15853,"I just received these earrings and they are very pretty. The 1/2 carat for each ear is a really nice size, and the color of the stones is wonderful, sort of an ocean/island blue, deeper than swiss and lighter than london blue topaz. The color in the photo is almost right if you can imagine adding a hint of yellow or green to the blue, causing it to look a little more medium aquamarine or, again, like ocean/island water. The faceting is nice and the earrings show good sparkle and allow light to come through, without diminishing the color. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

16215,"I just recently purchased these earrings in lavendar blue and clear crystal and I absoutely love them, they are simply beautiful. I have gotten so many compliments on them, I have even had 1 person who offered to buy them from me. I laughed and said sorry I just got them and I love them but I can tell you where you can get a pair just like them and thats Gem Avenue.They now have a pair just like mine, I will be shopping with Gem Ave again, I love there jewelry its well made and very beautiful, and at reasonable prices as well as they represent there items accurately. If you have not got a pair of these earrings I suggest you do I think you will love them just as much as I do.

14874,"I just wore these tonight after receiving them the other day, and they were the first clip-on earrings I have worn that didn't feel pinchy - I could barely tell they were there at all! And they are so pretty and sparkling without being too gaudy. A good balance between delicacy and being noticeable. I love the way they swing and sway. As someone who can't wear pierced earrings, have never found any clip ons that were comfortable, and loves the look of pretty earrings on other people, I am so happy to have found this. I will definitely look for others from this maker!

17984,"I knew from past experience that this pink amethyst stone would be lighter than the picture, but that was what I wanted. I wanted a very large, sparkling stone with just a wash of color, and that describes this ring. It has many light-catching facets and a subtle tint of violet-pink. Mine measures 3/4"" from top to bottom. Because of it's impressive size, I wear it on my middle finger and, needless to say, I wear no other rings on that hand that might cause a distraction. This is a ring that could make some ladies feel like royalty! A word on caring for this precious stone: While the 10K gold setting seems sturdy enough, there are only 4 prongs which seem a bit lighter than my other rings. Please go easy on this ring - spare it from housework and sports activities because you might cry if you lose it. This type of gemstone has also been known to chip, so treat it with lots of TLC. Hope you love your ring as I do mine!

17292,"I knew I wanted to give my daughter something special for her 8th grade graduation, something she would have forever. She wants to be an Egyptologist, and when I found Discoveries on Amazon, I knew I had found exactly the right gift. I ordered a personalized silver cartouche for her, but waited a little too long to order it to get it in time for graduation. I contacted Discoveries and they could not have been nicer to work with. I was advised that they would do everything they could to get it to me in time. Guess what arrived two days early???? My daughter LOVES her cartouche and wears it EVERY day. Some of the other kids were bragging about getting an iPh*ne for graduation, but how many of them will still have their graduation gift in a few years? My girl will have her cartouche forever, and couldn't be happier.

I'm glad I went ahead and did, though, because I personally didn't feel like they were too small at all. I bought the matching necklace to go along with these and will be wearing them for my wedding next month. They're gorgeous!

14574,"I left the jewelry industry about 10 years ago, and absolutely Loathe paying retail. My daughter had a similar necklace I'd gotten elsewhere years ago, but even though it was sterling, it had become discolored due to contact with chemicals. To cheer her up, I researched having it remade in scrap gold I had (would've cost over $200... with ME supplying gold), then tried finding one in sterling. Not only is this one about twice the weight of her original one, it had a much better chain (snake style), and Looks Fantastic! I was really leary about buying jewelry online, even going as far as to contact the seller to ask a question, which they promptly answered. It was a great purchase, Excellent value, and great customer support.

16849,"I like Duragold and these small earrings are very nice. I was a little surprised by the thinness of the the gold hoops. In the photo, the hoops look rather hefty when compared to the diameter of the earrings. In reality, the hoops are fairly thin when compared to the diameter of the earrings. I would buy them again because they are perfectly satisfactory, but they do not look exactly like the photo on the website.Update: Unfortunately, they do not seem to latch securely. I lost one several times but always found it. Alas, the last time I lost one I was unable to find it, so now I only have one left. If you get these you should be very careful, because it is very easy to lose one while you are wearing them.

18689,"I like the box it came in though you had to sort of set it up in the box to be presented (it was in a little plastic baggie in the box and you had to take it out and hook it on so you could see it displayed through the clear lid). I wish they hadn't stuck a sticker on the side of the box - it was difficult to get off and left it sticky. They could have put it on the bottom where it wouldn't have been noticeable. The necklace itself is very sweet and I look forward to giving it to my sister.

I was worried about these earings being too small for adults, but they are not. the clump is tight enough. doesn't come off on its own. I can even sleep with these without knowing I am having earings on. if you are looking for something to have on most of the time, then you have found just the right classice procut.

14194,"I like these earrings a lot. They are well matched in color and the tiger eye light play is very noticeable. The crystal beads add anice sparkle. These earrings are medium in size.

18009,"I like this piece, it's large, well made and eye catching. People notice it when I wear it and ask what it is. The opals sparkle, and I like it a lot. It's not too heavy but I think it's best on a long chain, not a choker around your neck. I have it on a 30"" square chain.
",5
12127,"I like this ring very much, it is actually the first ring I have ever purchased for myself, and fits my appearance well(Im, kind of a rocker guy). The only negative things about the ring is that it can damage some things due to the deep ridges. Also, do not wear the ring if you are using a bar of soap, because it will literally dig chunks out of the soap, and get stuck in the ring. It is easy to wash out, but reaps hell on your soap supply, haha. However, I feel that this was a great purchase, and I actually feel ""naked"" when I take the ring off. It almost feels like it's meant to be on my hand at this point. Which I've only worn for a little over a month. Also, if your fingers are very close together, I would not reccomend this ring, I have boney more spaced out fingers. However, if you do not have a boney more thin spaced out fingered hand. You are most likely going to have sores on your surrounding fingers from the width of the ring, unless you put the ring on your thumb. I even had a sore in the webbing of my fingers. However, I like the ring so much I left it on and the sore went away....P.S. The ring also seems to protect my hand. If I make a fist or touch something with the outside of the hand. The ring always seems to make first contact.

I found this one on line and read another review that liked her purchase inspired by a visit to the arch. It is high quality, was a good fair price, and delivery was very timely. It is a big larger than some of my charms, but I love it. I would recommend it to others. I have another STL Arch charm that I got in STL and it snags clothing, so am having it removed from the bracelet. Of course this one, that snags on towels and clothes, my hubby likes and thinks my new one looks like a small bottle opener......his fashion taste is very conservative and lacks luster, so what does he know?! I love this charm! This charm does not sang or catch on clothes....another great feature to a woman! Order and enjoy!

Can't have the assurance that if I lose one of these I will have a match anyway because of the size difference, but I am constantly checking the backs to be sure they are tight so hopefully I will never lose one of these!! Very complimentary with any outfit. Great purchase!

I feel this ring needs to be cleaned on a regular basis because it tarnishes but I clean all my silver jewelry on a regular basis for the same reason. I put this ring on my Amazon Wish List and received it as a gift. I really like it! It fits because I know my ring size so make sure you know your size before ordering. This company has an excellent return policy so if you get your size wrong, you can always exchange it for the right size with minimal hassle. Great customer service. I've bought from this company before and always had a good experience.

I have a rough job, but it's good to get undressed at the end of a long day and see it sill there. It's had a slight discoloration due to sweat and maybe because I never take it off, but that adds character to it. Now, no one has one like mine! I highly recommend this piece because all that I've been through since I've had it, the necklace seems to have made things better, and my missions more successful. Coincidence? You tell me!

Although they are a thicker hoop they are so light that I do not even know I am wearing them most of the time. I did not have any issues like some others have had with the thicker posts inserting and wearing them during the day. I did however have a bit of a hard time sleeping with them on. I was beginning to think that I would need to take them out before going to sleep however after about 3 sleeps I now have no issues with them at all and leave them in all the time. They appear to be really high quality earrings that are built to last. Shipping was extremely fast and I am very happy with them. Hope this review helps.

17088,"I love these earrings, they have a true white gold luster that is unmistakable. They are about the size of a nickle, which is a perfect size, and the tubes are a substantial diameter-YOU SEE THESE EARRINGS when you wear them. It is true the posts are a bit larger than what I was accustom to, but if you insert them with care, and don't just jam them in your ear, they are fine, REALLY! The first time I wore them I just wanted to pop them in and go, and it did hurt...a couple of days later, I tried again, inserting them carefully and slower, and haven't had any problems whatsoever. One of the best purchases I have ever made, I do recommed them to anyone.

15324,"I love these earrings. I was wearing another pair but they were so heavy it actually hurt to wear them. I started looking for a nice pair of silver hoops but wanted something a little different, these are exactly what I was looking for. Even better, they are not too heavy, not too long but not a simple 1"" hoop. MOST IMPORTANT...YOU WILL NOT LOSE THESE EARRINGS NOR WILL THEY FALL OFF, THEY LOCK DOWN SO WELL AND ARE QUALITY CRAFTED. I could not have been happier. Thanks so much for providing such awesome products at affordable prices!!
",5
13747,"I love these earrings. Small chunky hoops, about an inch in diameter - the perfect size. Not to big but still large enough to get noticed. A very expensive look for something that isn't too costly.I like that the clasp is a clasp and not a post. These earrings are not going to come out. They are comfortable to wear, even to bed which sometimes I do when I forget to take them out.The silver goes with everything and the cubic zirconium looks enough like diamonds that people mistake this for the real deal.

I disagree with the customer who was disappointed by the length. Usually, unless specified otherwise, the length includes the lever back of earrings, the bezel of a pendant, etc.The design is pretty, the quality is excellent, and I LOVE leverbacks because I don't lose the earring!

13276,"I love these earrings. They are even more beautiful in person. The colors are true and the crystals are clear and sparkle.

17177,"I love these earrings. They are really beautiful and so shiny that even with my long hair they're noticable.If you're interested in the size of the earrings, I would say that they're about the size of a quarter. Someone mentioned thick posts. The posts are the thickest I have seen but I like them. Every other pair of earrings I own have bent posts because I forget to remove them before going to sleep. Not these.The price is fantastic and they come in a nice box. Perfect affordable gift!

15147,"I love these earrings. When I bought them, I thought they would probably be cheaply made. To my surprise, they are very nice! I especially like the size (about the size of a US quarter coin). In addition, the seller shipped them super fast. Buy them, you won't be sorry!

They are so comfortable to wear and are a nice size if you want a hoop but don't want the dangers of catching them on anything.They were a bit smaller than I thought they would be, but once I put them on, I was hooked. I have short hair so they are visible regardless. If you have longer hair, these earring might be hidden.I'm glad I stumbled upon these - quite by accident. They are a replacement pair for ones my husband bought me that were almost 2"" across and made me look like DUMBO.The earrings are packaged nicely too. They come in a nice pouch with a authenticity tag.I highly recommend these earrings. Buy with confidence.

16590,"I love these little hoops!! Even though, I'd read all the reviews about how tiny they are, I don't think I was quite prepared... they are indeed TINY, but wide with a great finish .... perfect for everyday.... !!!

He has worn this for a year (without taking it off once) and it still looks just as good. No tarnish, no breaks, no pinching and is very well made.Nov 27, 2012~My man has been wearing this for almost three years now. Very masculine and sexy, excellent quality. He says that is is very comfortable as well.(It doesn't pull the hair on his arm) The style for this is sexy and sophisticated, it doesn't look like he is trying to be a teenager or a gigolo but is still very sexy. Nice weight and durable as well. This looks 10x better on than in the picture.

Looking at the photo on Amazon, you would think the charm is more 3D, but it is not. The children are quite flat, which is fine, it is absolutely beautiful. It does look so beautiful in person, the picture doesn't do justice.I see other reviews complaining of the chain being too short.. yes it is a shorter chain, but it is the perfect length for me. I don't want my necklace hanging down very far. It shows off perfectly on the vneck of my work shirt.I have recieved so many compliments on this necklace so far. It just shows the value of family and I can't say it enough how much I absolutely love it. This is a great gift that can be from anyone and would be a treasured gift!

18681,"I LOVE this necklace. My husband bought it for me for Christmas, just after I became pregnant with our second child. What I really love about this necklace is that I am able to wear it! I have a nickel allergy, and usually when I wear silver chains it makes the back of my neck itch and causes hives(because the chain is silver but the clasp is not)! I am so happy to say the clasp of this necklace seems to be nickel free, probably silver as well. I can wear it all day with no irritation. I have worn it many times. It is the only silver necklace chain I have been able to wear. I am SO happy with it! And, besides that, it is a really adorable pendant and I have gotten several comments on it.

17988,"I LOVE this pendant! It's so cute! And a good size. Not very small, not very big...somewhere in the middle. It is an inch long from the end of the babies tail to the tip of the mother's snout. Close to a half inch at the widest points which are the tip of the mother's dorsal fin to the tip of the mother's pectoral. I hope this makes sense for you to picture in your mind. It's very well made, excellent quality and a solid piece of silver. Has some good weight to it. Very shiny, and I LOVE that synthetic blue opal! It has a great sparkle ""glitter"" to it. The shine it has can not be captured by photo. It can't do it justice than the beauty you see in the real pendant. I just love that blue. It is my birthstone color and my favorite color too. Actually, I got this for Mother's Day...which is an excellent gift for that! It's a mother and baby! So cute! The baby is just too cute! There also is cubic zirconia's for each of the eyes too. I recommend this...especially on Mother's Day, or a new mom!

The necklace I immediately gave to my son as a toy- not impressed- but the pendant is just great. 1 inch across and about 1 1/2 inch high and a little over 1/8 inch thick, it feels good on. Though you can feel the cutouts, they aren't lifted enough to be catching on clothing and such. Very satisfied!

15216,"I love this piece! I bought it for scrapbooking. It does not hold ALL my stuff, but the rest is concealed in a closet and this is the only piece of furniture that's out in the open. I keep my Cricut in it, my tool turnaround, and cutters (adding pics for this review). The desk is a nice size, sturdy too. Both boxes came double boxed in a shipping carton that was padded with styrofoam all around the edges. I received them within a week of placing my order. They are very heavy, so I had the delivery man put them in the garage and then I made several trips up and downstairs with the individual pieces, laid them out in my hallway, and began assembly. The assembly does take an average of 3 hours (my teen helped me) and special attention just needs to be paid to the extension slides. Other than that it was very easy to do. I recommended having an electric drill with a phillips head on it. I've owned Sauder pieces in the past, and although they are heavy, pressed wood, they are fairly durable,even with all the moves we've made.

17728,"I love this ring! It's interesting to look at, and I like the design. I haven't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle. Maybe one day I might try it, but I like it so much I don't want to chance it now. Shipped fast.9/26/07 - update SOLUTIONThe following is a step by step solution for a thin band, four link puzzle ringSterling Silver Celtic Knot Puzzle Band Ring (Size 5,6,7,8,9,10). I e-mailed Silver Insanity and asked for the solution to this particular ring, and this is what I received. I did not edit any of the information sent. It's a bit wordy, but it works. I hope this helps everyone.1. You will notice that the four bands are similar, but upon closer inspection there are slight differences. Two of the links have a simple peak to them, and the other two links have a dip and a peak. Look carefully to identify each link. At this time, single out the link that has a simple peak, with 4 etches carved into it. (The etches may be faint, compare the two simple peak links and choose the one with more grooves)2. Once you have found the simple peaked link with four grooves, hold that link only, letting the other links dangle. Turn the ring so that the top of the peak is pointing away from you. There should be two links dangling from the link you are holding, with the fourth link dangling from those two links.3. While still holding the four grooved link, take the other simple peaked link, which should be the one dangling from the bottom, and bring it up to meet with the one you are holding. You should now be holding the two links together, the bands of the links together, and the points of the peaks pointing outwards, opposite of each other (It should look like a diamond)4. Continue holding the links together with your thumb and pointer finger (you will need your other fingers for the next part).5. You will notice that you now have the two 'dip and peak' links dangling from the two links you are holding. Select the link on the right---this is trial and error, sometimes the correct link will be on the right already, and sometimes you may have to pass the wrong link over the top of the ring in order to place the correct link in the proper position. The two dangling links are very hard to tell apart, so you will discover which is the correct one for the next step by following these instructions :6. After grabbing the dangling link on the right, turn the link so that the peaks and dips face you. Looking at the link, notice the dips and peaks. You want the link that has peaks that point like arrows to the LEFT, then the right. (The other link has peaks that point like arrows to the RIGHT, then left )7. When you have found the correct link for the next step, hold it taut against the two simple peak bands you have been holding between your thumb and forefinger. The band of those two links should now be resting against the LEFT pointing peak of the selected link, and you should adjust your hands so that you are holding that link on your pinky, taut.8. With your free hand, grab the last remaining link. Turn the link so that the peaks and dips face the top of the ring (you should be holding the ring upright the entire time) Bring the remaining link towards the right, and overlap it with the link you're holding on your pinky. The easiest way to do this is to imagine you are trying to put the other link on your pinky with the one that's already there. If this is done correctly, you will still be holding the two simple peak links between your thumb and forefinger, and they will form a diamond shape. You will also be holding the other two links on your pinky, they should form a figure eight, with the other two bands passing through the center.9. At this point, I usually change the position of my hands. Now ,hold the figure eight together with your thumb and middle finger, trying not to disrupt the other ones too much! Try to maintain the diamond shape in some way, hold it however you are comfortable, in a way that will enable you to continue with these instructions.10. Select the link on the top, closest to you. (part of the diamond) Spin the link around so that the peak fits through the figure eight---also, make sure that once the peak is inside the figure eight it also passes through the band of the other part of the 'diamond' . When the link has been spun, and passed through the figure eight and the band of the remaining link, fold it downwards, so that it is flush with the two links that form a figure eight.11. Well, you made it to the last remaining link...congratulations!All you have to do now is carefully spin the last link so the peak fits between the peaks and gaps of the already mostly assembled ring (just spin it, no need to do anything fancy! ) Once the last remaining link has been passed through the ring, fold it down to lay flush with the rest of the links.12. Enjoy your puzzle ring!

16580,"I may not be the best judge of jewelry, but my wife liked them very much as a Christmas gift (and she is forthright enough to let me know if she didn't). They are elegant in their simplicity, and very lightweight. Although they are the perfect size for my wife, they are probably smaller than you would expect, so I would suggest checking the size carefully before ordering. The clasp secures the rod tightly so I doubt they would be likely to fall off.
",5
18742,"I must admit that I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this ring, being that it was so reasonably priced, but it's lovely. It's dainty, but not flimsy. The stone is nice and for the price, this is a great ring. I got the peridot, but I'm going to get another color as well.
",5
14362,"I must say, this ring is even better than I was expecting it to be. It took a little bit of breaking in to make it spin better but it, within the last few hours, has become my new favorite pass time. If you're a fidgety person or are in need of a none harmful nervous habit, this is the ring for you! I have to take the ACT in a couple of weeks and I can't wait to sit and spin the ring for the whole 3 hours. ^_^Highly recommended.

13656,"I ordered and paid for this bracelet on 12/31/12. The ETA was 1/7 to 1/9 2013. The bracelet actually arrived 1/4 2013 way ahead of this ETA. Because I first read all the customer reviews before purchasing, I did tighten the two side clasp hinges which I personally believe is no big deal considering the price I paid for it. The bracelet is now tightly clasped and I fear no possiblity of it opening and slipping off. I also tried numerous times to make sure I will be able to open and close it on my own and have no trouble doing so. I do, however, advise anyone buying this bracelet to also tighten those two side clasp hinges before wearing it. All you need is a clamp or even a scissors would do the trick.The actual bracelet is just beautiful. It sparkles and catches the light like real diamonds. The diamonds themselves are also small enough to fool anyone except for possibly a jeweler. It layers beautifully with my two other silver bracelets as I now mostly wear either white gold or sterling silver. And just like my other two bracelets, I will always wear it and not take it off to save time in the mornings.Also, I used to watch and buy a lot of jewelry from QVC. From what I have learned over the years, diamonds really glisten when cast in either white gold or silver as versus yellow gold. And the savings in cost from buying this bracelet as versus a diamonique bracelet from QVC is $60 or higher. And it looks just as beautiful as any of the jewelry I have ever bought from this TV shopping channel. I am so so pleased with my present to me. Love it.

Normally I buy them from the kiosk in the mall for $25-30 each. Sometimes the kiosk has a deal for when you spend a $100 or more, but even with the deal, they are terribly overpriced.THESE ARE THE SAME as the kind in the mall. Side by side, they are the same quality. They look the same, they feel the same, they are the same. The only difference is that they have not been handled by sales clerks and strangers in the mall. Oh, and the price is not the same.I've discovered that I go through these like earrings. Either a part falls off or catches on clothing and it's all over. All of my favorite ones have been ruined. One part is gone and they need to be thrown away. It's not good to get too 'attached.'I bought these from Body Candy. They arrived in a few days, much earlier than the date given on purchase, and the prices were excellent.

16393,"I ordered these as a gift for an 11-year-old girl who is not permitted to wear large earrings. Though they're not blue (the blue hue in the picture is most likely the result of iridescence; the cubes are clear, traditional crystal) they're cute. They do measure an inch in length; however, this is outstretched from the tip of the post to the finishing bead beneath the cube. The dangling portion--cube and all--is 5/8 inches, and the cube itself is a little under 1/4 of an inch; the metal rings are the remaining 3/8. They're very dainty, very pretty, and at a very reasonable price. Would recommend.

I LOVE THEM. They have been a staple item in my wardrobe since the day I got them. I'm partial to white gold, but this blend is beautiful!They're not too big; you can gauge the size in the photo by the ear clasp--most earrings have the same size ear clasp. (1"" tall x 3/4"" wide x 1/2"" thick) I think they're absolutely perfect for the office and carry over very well for a special night out. I've had them polished a few times, but that's because I wear them all the time! The best thing is that they're not heavy at all. They're hollow, but they're substantial.I read a comment from one reviewer stating that his wife's earrings broke apart. Honestly, they're welded in three places; I don't see it happening without some manhandling. I'm looking at mine now, and while they're dinged up a bit, I don't mind at all. They've been worn a lot during the past 5 years...even in Africa, Yemen, and the Middle East where I served as a Marine! (Yes, we do get to wear civilian attire occasionally depending on our duties.)

Actually, it's a little prettier than the photo and you really can't tell how shiny it is. It has a nice weight and a solid feel. The chain is also shiny and looks like liquid silver. I can't say how well it will hold up as I've only had it for a few days, but it looks like I will be enjoying it for a long time. For the price (it comes with the chain) how can you beat it?

17521,"I ordered this on a sale and was very happy when I saw it. I didn't know what ""fiber optic"" was, but I did read elsewhere that it is glass; the same type of glass they use to make fiber optic cables. Maybe that means it is clearer or something. It does have tiny little lines inside it so it has this nice luster as the light moves across it almost like a satin fabric shines.I don't mind the adjustable band especially since it is easily to change sizes or different fingers. The overall size of the face and the radiating bezel is about the size of a penny. I think it looks more like a sun face than a moon (because of the setting) and the color (which is like an apricot color.) It makes me think of summer sunshine every time I wear it. My sister liked it so much that I got her one and the blue fiber optic earrings (also by Sajen.) I have received many compliments on it during the first few weeks I have owned it.

I was unwilling to bump for faster shipping to ensure Christmas delivery - so image my surprise when the ring arrived before Christmas. My daughter absolutely loves the ring. She normally buys her rings in size 6 but this particular style was sold out in all sizes except size 5. I went ahead and ordered the 5 and it fits perfect. She loves that this ring allows her ring finger to set tight against her pinky and middle finger without gaps. It has plenty of bling which she loves and yet it doesn't seem to catch or snag clothing. Very pleased with this company - their shipping speed and product. Will look to do business with them again.

14800,"I ordered this ring to wear on my ""taken"" finger [you know, the usual spot for a wedding ring], simply to show that I'm ""spoken for"" by my very serious GirlFriend, even though we'll probably never get ""married"" in the traditional, Xian sense [We are NOT Xians!]. I wanted something that didn't look like every other ""wedding"" band in the world, without being gawdy or overly-decorated. This ring is IT. I think almost any ""married"" man would like to be able to wear a black ""wedding"" ring. Fortunately, for me, my Girl is into it, too. The black metal looks Great and is VERY prominent & attention-grabbing, being against my whitey skin. And what man wouldn't enjoy telling his friends that his ""wedding"" ring is made of Titanium??? The ring is even darker black than the picture represents, AND shinier, too. It glistens in every light. It's absolutely Beautiful. It's refreshingly Unique. It's deliciously Sinister. The price is Right. Shipping was fast. I couldn't be more pleased with this ring. I'll wear it for the rest of my life!

Very well made and strong- I wear mine every day, and it stands up to a lot of use and abuse. I would certainly recommend to anyone wanting an Italian charm bracelet :)
",5
15358,"I ordered two of these rings and am very happy with both. I agree with previous reviewers that there are sharp edges on the ring, however I don't find them to be of any danger. I did, by accident, scratch the inside of a car window in a rental when I smacked a bug. Titanium is a strong metal and the ring is holding up well. I'm hard on my jewelry and so far, this one is standing the test. The ring sized a little larger than I had expected, and I did use a professional sizer to measure before ordering. Wear an 11 but ended up exchanging it for a 10.

Many people have commented on their simplicity and elegance. I was also impressed with the quality of the materials used! I will definitely order from this seller again - gorgeous product!

13605,"I pirchased this as a gift for a friend. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It was so much nicer than expected -- with such a low price my expections weren't high. I had been looking at CZ pendants for awhile. I wanted an adjustable chain and a nice size stone. I got exactly what I was looking for with this. It is really lovely and the stone is just the right size. In fact, I like it so much, I just ordered another for myself. Thank you, Amazon. You have never disappointed me.

16769,"I purchaesd these for my wife just prior to Christmas. She wanted simple, yet nice, earrings. These fit perfectly and were exactly what she wanted. She does not take them out of her ears even while smimming, exercising, and everyday work. They dont get dirty, get smear marks, and best of all they do not hurt her ears. She says ""Good Bye to Claires!"". Great deal, and they are just what she wanted.

13268,"I purchase a LOT of jewelry online, and it's always a hit or miss as you can't really see how they look on you, and I dont have enough imagination for even trying.These earrings are one of the BEST buys I have purchased! And that's saying a LOT cause I place about literally dozens of orders per week.They have a nice weight to them, are very well made, shiny and so unique! The loops actually move in and out as theyre not soldered together, thus making it fluid in motion, and looks great with my long hair.Also, speaking of hair, it doesn't ""disappear"" in it as most earrings do, but at the same time is not heavy to weigh my lobes down or feel uncomfortable, nor look gaudy looking. It's actually very classy looking.For the price I paid (got them during a gold box special with an extra 60% off), I feel as though I got a real bargain! I would buy them as gifts for the price as it's definitely affordable enough, but I like being unique, so I'll just graciously accept compliments instead. ;DDon't hesitate to buy these! They are just as pictured, and even better in person as you can feel the quality and weight of it.

17498,"I purchased a Q-link after wearing it while muscle testing with electronic equipment. Once I started wearing it regularly, I found it allowed me to focus more clearly while working around computers, cell phones and other electronics, and I had less fatigue in the evenings. The only thing I did different was to wear the Q-link (classic). Everyone I tested this on found the same thing - their muscles weakened when not wearing the Q-link, yet they were able to maintain muscle strength with the Q-link around their neck.Unfortunately I left my Q-link in a Hawaii hotel and they were unable to ""find"" it. Right. Anyway, I noticed an immediate de-focus and less clarity while working around computers. Thank goodness I was able to re-order. I wasn't much of a believer in the whole EMF thing until after I'd been wearing this for about 3 weeks.

19024,"I purchased a tribal ""pendant"" but didn't like the leather and rubber necklace cords the merchant had on hand. So, I did a little searching on Amazon and found this beauty. Nice and smooth against the skin, doesn't look dorky like rubber, and doesn't give off that funky smell leather does.Closes with a chinese-button type of ""clasp"" - basically a stylized knot at one end slips through a small loop at the other end. Cool idea and have never had the necklace fall off, even after sleeping with it on.

They have a bit of sparkle to them that you can't tell from the picture or even when they are in the box. But the sparkle is quite noticeable when worn. Everyone loved their gifts, and I was happy that they were happy. The price is more than reasonable for such a beautiful gift. So, don't let the picture online fool you.

As a necklace I think the chain style would look heavier than it feels...not dainty. Perfect for anklet or bracelet, and if u want to wear just the chain around ur neck....or with a med to lrge pendant. Small looped pendants wont flow over to chain. I put my tiny double happiness symbol pendant right on the clasp, which looks really cool.....like a tiffany tag. Super fast delivery. Ordered at night & recvd in one day.

The setting looks classy, and the aquamarine is beautifully eye-clear (tiny white occlusions are visible if you look closely, so the clarity rating should be I1, not SI2).

I looked in the local discount stores and found their earrings to be overpriced and cheap looking. These are elegant looking and seem to glow. They are also extremely comfortable and weightless. I spend a lot of time on the phone and they are not even bothersome there. They are the perfect size and weight for an all around earring. An added plus is that they don't irritate my sensitive ears.

Didn't want to purchase her very large hoops, and didn't want them too small - They are approx. 1 inch in diameter and hang nicely below the lobe.

",5
16846,"I purchased these for myself and when I saw them, I realized that they were the perfect gift for my sister's birthday. She likes smaller earrings that are simple, not showy but are of good quality. My sister is delighted with them. As it turns out, she was needing something to wear other than her plain gold studs to wear to work, church, or anywhere. She appreciates simplicity in her jewelry and she is thrilled to have these.If you want big and showy, these are not for you. But if you like classic simplicity, these will please you.Now I have to buy another pair for myself!!
",5
13586,"I purchased these for use with a tux, and have worn them a couple times. They have generally worked out very well:Pros:-They have a nice heft to them; they don't feel or look cheap-Simple, elegant design-They didn't fall out or get lost during long hours of crazy wedding partying and dancing-Comes with a nice little box (although not the highest quality box)Cons:-A bit expensive, although still reasonable compared to alternatives-Would be nice it the box they came in wasn't quite so cheap / plastic, but then again, the box isn't what people seeI'd recommend them to those looking for some nice but not outrageously priced studs / links to go with a tux.
",5
16645,"I purchased these hoops about 6 months ago. I wear them about everyday and they are holding up wonderfully. They also survived a 10 day backpack trip to Europe while stashed in my change purse (traveled very light - little to no luggage).Recommend for anyone who doesn't need to change earrings everyday, but likes the classic hoop on hoop look for those like me who have double and triple holes.
",5
19735,"I purchased these studs about 4 months ago for around $21. For the money it is an exceptional value. The stones are a good size and are easily visible and the color is clear and vibrant. I wear the earrings probably 3-4 times a month and have had no problem with the earring backs falling off. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.
",5
16884,"I purchased these through a lightening deal and so happy that I did. They will be given to my mom who has been asking for new earrings. She does have a pair of hoops in yellow gold so I thought these would a wonderful addition. After seeing them in person, I'm glad I ordered them. They are small but I think they are a great size even for an adult.
",5
15905,"I purchased this and love the detail! For $19.95 plus free shipping it is a great bargain. This necklace looks really striking against a black background and makes the Angel appear more pronounced and radiant. I will purchase another for a friend. This is a great find!

19407,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my teenage nephew who plays a guitar and is aspiring to be in a rock band. This was perfect for him and he totally loves it and pretty much wears it everyday. I think a leather cord would make a better and stronger holder for the pendant as this one seems a little flimsy. Overall, a great piece at a great price.

16513,"I purchased this chain for my husband for Fathers Day. I was really impressed with the look and quality of this necklace. It was a lot heavier than I expected and very well made. I was hoping he would not like it just so he would give it to me!! HA One thing though, he says its just a little tight so a 20"" might be better for a man but he still loves it and wears it daily.

12463,"I purchased this cross as a gift for myself for Christmas it was one of four cross's I bought myself and I am truly glad I did It is so beautiful, It means so much to me to be able to share my faith with others.When ever someone notices my cross it is and instant conversation starter and of course the conversation always turns to religion,we talk about where we go to church It gives you a chance that you might not otherwise get to talk to someone about God. and you never know when that might just be what that other person needs.So buy it because it might suprise you and help you reach someone, by it because it is a very nice way to share your faith and buy it because it is beautiful.
",5
17633,"I purchased this cross for my best friend of 20+ years who has been a dancer for all of that time. I had it sent to me first for inspection before I gave it to her. I thought it was beautiful - the shape of the cross suits the person and her God-given talent of dance. I recommend this gift for a personal gift that's not too flashy but very classy!

15784,"I purchased this item as a gift for my wedding party and am very pleased with how it looks. The pendant itself is rather small but the shiny surface makes up for it making the pendant attractive. The faces have good detail and are readily recognizable. Comes with a box sterling silver chain that does the pendant justice. I can't wait to present it! Overall this is a very nice value.
",5
17819,"I purchased this item for my sister's birthday. Amethyst is her favourite stone and she's quite the diva, so the diamonds are a fabulous touch. I really wanted to keep it for myself, but I sent it and she absolutely loved the necklace. I don't have any idea about it's durability, though.

18613,"I purchased this necklace as a gift for my grown daughter for her birthday...when it arrived I was so pleased with the quality and size of the pendant!

This gift, I know, conveyed all of that to her sentimental heart. Thank you for such a nice piece of jewelry, at such a great price.

15464,"I purchased this necklace for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it! It came quickly and was packaged in a pretty box. The necklace is definitely a good value for this price. Buyers should pay attention to the size which is noted in the description. The picture portrays the necklace as being much larger. However, the size of the necklace is accurately described in the description.
",5
17659,"I purchased this necklace nearly a year ago, and I still wear it every day. I've heard people complain about it turning their skin green, and I can say I've never had that problem with mine. What I find to be interesting is the large number of people who say ""it's not worth that much money"" or ""it doesn't look as good as I'd thought it did"". As a Buddhist myself, I purchased this pendant to remind myself of my faith, and the things I hold dear, not to try and show off to the world my religious choices. So if you wish to purchase this pendant for your own spiritual reasons, I think it's wonderful. If you're looking to brag and show off, or get a flashy necklace, this isn't for you.

Love them, they are comfortable and weighted but not heavy, they are of much higher quality than I expected for the price. Thank you for offering such great merchandise at great prices, I will be ordering from you again.

",5
19643,"I purchased this piece to create a replica of Bella's braclet from Meyer's Twilight series. Although the original was bronze in color, none anywhere that I could find were like that. I chose this one because I thought it looked best of all the ones I could find. The person this gift is for was very particular about the wolf charm because it is supposed to be wooden, but I think she will be satisfied with this one. I worried at first after receiving it about it possibly being too small, but the size is good. The quality appears excellent.
",5
18501,"I purchased this pin as a Christmas gift for a friend. IMO, the pin is even nicer in person. The simple, yet pretty thistle design goes with everything. The pin arrived well before Christmas and was packaged nicely in a velvet jewelry bag. Would buy from this seller again.
",5
57788,"I purchased this pin at 70% off, and at that price, it was a bargain. (Generally speaking, I think that jewelry by Zina is completely overpriced!) This is a great piece of jewelry, the silver is quite substantial, very shiny and smooth. It has a good weight to it and the design is just lovely. I bought it as a birthday gift for my stepmother, and when it arrived, I almost kept it for myself, I liked it so much! My husband felt the same way. My stepmother hasn't received it yet, but I am sure she will love it, too!
",5
12888,"I purchased this pinky ring during Black Friday on a whim, and three years later, I still love it.The form is flattering to an overly thin finger, and I'm able to bend it to adjust the width if need be. The pink stones are shiny without being tacky, and the ring has gone through much wear and tear without any major damage. When you're as klutzy as I am, that's saying a lot!This is a great product, and I'd definitely consider more from the same jeweler.
",5
57941,"I purchased this ring as a gift for our 13 year-old niece who just became a Bat-Mitzvah. She is the girl who has EVERYTHING (tiffany jewelry, 1st diamond earrings from her parents, Vera bradley bags in every color and style, ipod, cell phone- you name it she has it) My point is that she was very hard to shop for and I didn't just want to give her cash. I wanted her to have something that she'd always remember we gave to her.I searched for MONTHS (3 to be exact, and some items were just too mature looking, others were way out of my price range and other items seemed like they might be too cheap (as in the lack of quality). This ring in white gold is an outstanding value compared to what I could find at a local jeweler. I wanted white gold, and thought a heart would be appropriate. Well, I couldn't touch anything like this for under $350 discounted at the jewelry store, so I immediately came home after looking, and purchased this ring.The white gold looks stunning and it won't tarnish like silver. I didn't expect a 13 year-old girl, to actually use a polish cloth. So silver was OUT (which is what the lovely clerks at the store kept trying to sell me, because my price limit was $150-$170 MAX.) The size 5 fit her ring finger perfect, and from the second she opened it- she put it on- and I could tell she loved it and felt like a mature young lady.The diamond is small-but surprisingly sparkly- so don't expect a miracle in a $149 ring that is 14K white gold! Given the size, I would really give the review 4.5 stars, but like I said, you get what you pay for, and so, at this price, it is a 5 star ring well worth it. What you are paying for is the white gold (not the diamond) which isn't thin looking. The ring, in my opinion looks and feels solid.While I did buy this for a teen- I would wear it too. I love hearts, and think it is really an adorable ring for the money.

18295,"I purchased this ring for my Mother's 83rd birthday. She loves marcasite jewelry and the ring looked beautiful online. My order was received, processed and forwarded to me very promptly and accurately. The ring was absolutely gorgeous; much more than the picture online. My Mother was so excited, it fit perfectly. I am extremely pleased with the service and product. I will definitely purchase from this vendor again.

14356,"I purchased this ring well over a year ago and just forgot to give it a review. It's a spectacular looking ring and it seems to be holding up pretty well.
",5
15642,"I purchased this same product from a different seller about a year and a half ago. I had no problems and the necklace is fairly durable but after a year the ring came off of the cross, I now wear it on the chain because I haven't had the chance to find a good glue to put it back together but be careful--the ring is very easy to lose and just slips right out if not held in properly. Aside from that the cross hasn't bent or broken and the color on the inside is just as bright as it was when I first bought it. I switched out chains but only because I wanted the necklace to be a little longer so I could wear it along with other necklaces, I use the original chain for a different necklace and it's lasted very well.
",5
18134,"I purchased this to give to my late husband the night before our wedding. His dad wore a similar St. Christopher's medal and had passed away. I wanted him to have something to remind him his dad was with him. It was exactly what I hoped would arrive. Good quality and shipped quickly. I would absolutely order it again!!!

18536,"I put the ring in my cart as a.. I wish I could get this... Later I placed a cheap CZ ring in my cart. I placed the order and realized in my horror that the &#34;Your order has been shipped&#34; included this ring that I did not delete. When I received it I fell in love with it. Although the diamond is small which is very clear what size it is in the description..it is still beautiful. It is elegantly simple. I have never had a &#34;real diamond&#34; before and after 30 years of marriage my husband saw how much I loved it- he wouldn't let me return it. One word of caution- the prongs are very sharp- use caution around babies. They seem to be smoothing after 3 months. Buy it and ENJOY!!!
",5
12704,"I put this on two months ago when I received it, and haven't taken it off since. It still looks brand new and I just know it will last a long time. Great buy and no complaints whatsoever.
",5
16523,"I read all of the other people who rated these earrings before purchasing and they were all positive. I love these earrings and wear them every day. They can be worn dressed up or down. I wear two sets of earrings and these go great with my diamond studs for dress or just plain gold studs for every day. The closure is very secure and the price was excellent. I highly recommend.
",5
12320,"I read elsewhere in the reviews that a lady's husband got in the shower and his ring turned. If you use selenium sulfide shampoo and it comes into contact with silver, it will turn the silver dark as if badly tarnished. I have had a difficult time trying to get the ring back to normal. So beware!~Kathleen
",5
15565,"I read many of the reviews and one person mentioned getting them for her niece. I thought great idea, I""ll get them for my granddaughter. She loves pink and so many people mentioned they were more pink than red. Mine are definately red but are really beautiful earrings. Very dainty.
",5
17737,"I read the reviews and I understand how this ring can be frustrating, but I absolutely love it. This was my second puzzle ring so I already knew how to put it together. Once you take the time to learn it is a fantastic conversation piece, and very pretty.
",5
16355,"I read the reviews before buying and I read the most that the cross was small. I was picturing something so tiny that no one would notice. (I've been getting compliments on it all night). It's gorgeous, simple and doesn't stand out too much. I love it. Best cross I have ever owned. The link is the picture of the necklace on me.[...]

",5
16343,"I really like my gold cross. I am going to wear it to church this sunday. I feel protected when I wear it! It's perfectly sized. It's smaller than usual, but that 's the way I like it. Very fine and delicate. I am happy with it, as I lost my confirmation cross many years ago at my grandparent's farm. This is perfect.
",5
18854,"I really like the belly button ring...it looks very pretty on. Very well made for the price! I received this before the actual delivery date also, so that was a nice surprise.
",5
19676,"I really like the idea of the smaller diamonds flanking the larger one. It sparkles in the light and pairs nicely with a wedding band with 5 little diamonds across the top. Everything is in place and seems like a solid ring.My wife uses lotion and like all rings even if your careful it will fade to yellow a little over the years. My ring also with the Rhodium plating never faded as i don't use lotion.
",5
13326,"I really like these earrings and so far they haven't fallen apart like other earrings I've bought from Amazon. My best friend thinks I paid too much for them and she doesn't believe they are actual Swarovski crystals. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference, so I am not sure. All I know is they are beautiful.
",5
14889,"I really like these earrings, the green and black are very beautiful. I did put tighter backings on them though and clipped the posts shorter so they stay on tighter and dont stab.
",5
18111,"I really like these earrings. I bought them to match a necklace and find I keep wearing them with our without the necklace. They look good with a lot of the clothes I wear.
",5
19697,"I really like these earrings. The levelback is very nice and stays closed so you don't have to worry about them falling off or getting snagged by clothing. Since they're white, they match with lots of outfits. I have received a lot of compliments about these earrings.

",5
18780,"I really like this. I was having a lot of difficulty putting on my bracelets and was frustrated enough that I wouldn't even buy them if they had a clasp. Using this, I can fasten any of my bracelets with ease now and I don't have to worry about what type of bracelet it is. I haven't had a problem with any of the bracelets I've tried it on so far.
",5
15193,"I really like those earrings. I find the size is just right. The metal is nicely polished and has the right size too. The stone is beautiful and very clearl. The blue is very pretty. They came very fast with a certificate and a pretty box. I would recommend them for sure.
",5
14710,"I really liked it. It had a really good look, and it locked well. It seems likes it's a good weight and of good quality. basically what you see in the picture is exactly what you get. If you're considering buying it, go for it, because you won't be upset. My girl is going to love it (i'm saving it til' Valentines Day).The engravings are what caught my eye, they're simple but still very elegant. it's a perfect balance.I recommend this seller. Speedy Delivery as well.
",5
16648,"I really liked the 14K Yellow Gold Round Hoop Earrings that I recently ordered from Amazon.com. They were purchased at a fabulous price and were better quality I thought than the gold hoops that I had paid twice the amount for. They were very light weight and the gold was a nice quality. I would purchase these earrings again for myself and for gifts in the future.
",5
19301,"I really liked the different sizes and they are very nice. I will be ordering again from them. I told all my friends about them and they really are surprised and said they will be ordering some for themselves.

",5
16305,"I really love the look of these earrings! I was trying to match a necklace and they turned out to be perfect! Another advantage is the Leverbacks since I don't like hooks that get caught in my hair. The Black and Clear Swarovski Crystals are beautiful and the earrings have a very dressy look without being too long for me.
",5
15770,"I really love these earrings. They have a middle eastern antique look. The style and color are beatiful.
",5
13705,"I really love this pair of hoops, they are at a size to wear I would feel comfortable wearing them everyday. I am going to be buying another pair for my second ear piercing.
",5
16735,"I really loved these earrings! They were a perfect size and went with almost everything. The down side for me is - I quickly lost one because I have long hair and when I move my hair off my shoulder I caught the earring and it came off very easily and was lost. I like that it didn't tug my ear or damage my ear - but because they are so very light weight - I never noticed it had fallen off. I bought another pair and did the same thing often enough thta I now only have one of the four earrings left....bummer....
",5
17011,"I really was pleased with these earrings. I put them on as soon as they arrived and have not removed as yet. Comfortable, pretty, and just the right size .
",5
14048,"I really wasn't clear on the exact size of this necklace when I ordered it. I was ecstatic when it arrived. It is not too thin, not too thick, just right. It is well made and has a sturdiness to it. My daughter ordered one after she saw mine. It is a true bargain for the price.
",5
17175,"I really, really like this ring. It's easy on the eyes, was easy on the wallet, made of sterling silver, and best of all it comes in a wide array of sizes. I am a full figured gal, and have been looking for a ring for my left index finger at a size 13/14 for some time. Not too much luck there, unless I wanted some ugly costume jewelry or man's ring... Took a chance on this - and love it. I originally had a size 13 in my cart, but based on another review - I opted for one size up and ordered the 14. I am glad I did as the 13 would have been a little tight for me.Some of the reviews said the ring thickness is too ""thin"". In my opinion, it is just right. This is an extremely wide band and if it was any thicker - the ring would not be comfortable to wear. It is simply perfect as it is. If they had different designs in this type of ring - I'd buy 'em all. Wish the seller offered these rings in the bigger sizes with stones in them - I'd buy those too!Can't beat this ring for 30 bucks, and combine that with lightning speed shipping and you have a winner. I ordered Wednesday night from NY and it arrived Saturday morning from Arkansas.

",5
18652,"I received my beautiful ""Loving Family"" before Christmas (it was a gift to me from my husband and children) and love it! The pendant seems to be very well made, of good weight (not flimsy), and beautiful. I plan to replace the light-weight box chain with a better quality chain. Only one negative comment - and it's not that negative - and that is the fact that I received the necklace in a little cardboard/windowed package, not a gift box as pictured in the detail pictures listed with the product. I would buy from this seller in the future.

19186,"I received my order very quickly and am very pleased with it. It takes up a small space and has a clear cover to keep dust off from earrings. The earrings fit very nicely and because I keep it on my dresser, I remember to wear my earrings and put them away quickly so I know where they are. I have organized them by color in the box and it is fun to have them organized and ready to wear. It has been a good help and something I have been wanting to find for quite a while. Well worth the money and would be a great gift to give.

12948,"I received these as a birthday gift and love them! The color of the gold is gorgeous and I love the detailing of the design. They photo does not do justice. Got compliments the first time I wore them!
",5
14739,"I received these earings rather quickly and when I opened the box, they were just as I imagined. They are light and delicate. The earing is also three separate pieces so its cute when it dangles because the three pieces move. Also, you get what you pay for because the color seems to be painted on and I hope over time it does not fade away. Nonetheless, I like them and would recommend purchasing these earings. I have received many compliments on them :)
",5
15475,"I received these earrings as a surprise Christmas gift and I couldn't be happier with them! Not only are they beautiful (I get so many compliments on them --even from guys!) they are very unique, which I love. I'm surprised at some of the reviews that say they don't like how thin and light they are --that's one of my favorite features. I have bought several pairs of earrings only to lose one almost right away because the clamps don't stay closed. Getting these on and off takes a little getting used to, but they won't fall out of your ear unnoticed! The trick is to look in the mirror and ""twist"" them in a continuous spiral motion starting at the tip of the curl. Once you get the hang of it it's super quick. I will definitely check out more of their jewelry to add to my Wish List!
",5
13291,"I received these earrings with a matching bracelet as a holiday gift. They are dainty but WOW, do they catch the light! They are sparkly and the multicolor stones go well with almost everything. I love wearing them and will be purchasing a pair of the lavender crystal ones for myself soon.
",5
13330,"I received these fantastic earrings and immediately fell in love with them.They go with so many of my outfits,and I have received compliments every single time I wear them.They make me feel *with it* and *jazzy.*
",5
13277,"I received these today I'm quite pleased. They are very pretty and look better than they do in the picture. The crystals are not &#34;fixed&#34; in place, but have a small bar running vertically through all of them. There is slight movement of the crystals, but not much. The earrings are exactly an inch and a half long from the very top of the hoop to the bottom. The &#34;925&#34; stamp is on there so it is real sterling silver. I would recommend these to anyone who likes pastel colors and earrings that aren't really dainty or too large.
",5
15898,"I received this as a birthday gift and it is just gorgeous! The picture here does not do this ring justice! When I saw how much he paid for it, I was shocked....it looks very expensive!!
",5
17376,"I received this as a Christmas present from my husband, after having hinted around a little. It is extremely cute, well-made, and unusual. It's subtle implication of just a little devilishness is clever. A pretty piece to wear for almost any occasion (except maybe church?). It comes with a very delicate gold chain which I would temporarily change with a stronger one, depending on the occasion. Love it!
",5
17606,"I received this beautiful cross for Christmas this year. When I opened the gift I could not believe how stunning the cross was! It is very delicate, the chain is very thin and fragile, which I think adds to beauty. The cross is small and very simple but lovely just the same. Sometimes the simple things in life are the best. It seems to not be a problem with scratches and shines beautifully. The photographs on the site does not show the beauty of this cross at all.I am very pleased with this cross and would recommend it to anyone who likes simple yet elegant jewelry.
",5
17363,"I received this beautiful pendant from my husband for Valentine's Day. I have had many compliments on it. The pendant is just the right size for me. It's not huge and not to small you can clearly see the detail of the horns and tail.
",5
19531,"I received this bracelet as a Christmas gift and wear it most days. I bought one as a gift for a fellow cat lover. It is nicely made and appropriate for someone 8 or 80. Each cat has its own distinct personality. Service was excellent from Silver Insanity and I highly recommend them.
",5
14519,"I received this bracelet promptly. It was nicely tucked inside a velvet bag, inside a box. I was happy to find it fit my tiny wrist perfectly- I was afraid it would be the typical one-size-fits-all bracelet that would slide off my hand and I'd have to get it sized. Not so!! Very happy....
",5
19210,"I received this lovely ring in record time and in perfect shape. It's exactly what I wanted and it was on my finger in seconds. Over the years, I've put on some weight and could no longer wear my original set. This is a wonderful replacement.LK
",5
19228,"I received this Music Box today and I checked it since the reviews said it may come broken. Well it didn't and its BEAUTIFUL!!! It came in one wonderful piece with NOTHING broken.I wish the horse didn't spin so fast and the music was a bit slower, other then that, its great. Its a nice size box, big enough for a child.This is definitely a gift for an older child since its somewhat delicate.

17978,"I received this necklace and when I saw it, the most beautiful memories of my best years of my life, 15 or 18 years old will be returned and it was so sensacional because I am a person that loves to remember the wonderful dates that I lived with my mother and father. And I write more: All my friends here in Brazil loved this necklace because the pink colour of it looks me so wonderful!I indicated for all to want have a different necklace because it is what I described.Thanks for Amazon for this fantastic design. The only that I don't make for you is because you don't shipping to Brasil. I am so sorry about.

14376,"I received this necklace for easter and it is absolutely gorgeous! I always mix gold and silver so this necklace is perfect for doing just that. So far it is just as shiny and polished as the day I got it, no stones loose or missing and no tarnishing. Definitely a wonderful buy.
",5
18642,"I received this necklace for Mother's Day and I love it! Like other reviews have stated there is a sparkle and shine to it that doesn't show up in the pictures. The chain that comes with the necklace is very sturdy, so I wear mine all the time even when I sleep. With two children, most of my chains would have snapped. I would definately recommend this necklace as a gift to any Mother.
",5
13146,"I received this necklace yesterday and gave it to my wife early as we are about to go on a cruise and I felt she could wear it while we were gone. I was totally embarrassed when she opened the box. The chain was in a knot that looked like someone spent the whole day tying it up. There was only 1"" of chain there, the rest of it was in a huge knot. I had to take it to a jeweler and it took him almost an hour and cost me an additional $25.00 and he spoke very poorly of the quality of the necklace. I will never buy from this company again. If they can't check the items prior to shipping, I had rather pay a few dollars more to get better service.
",5
18518,"I received this off my wish list from a dear friend and I must say, it's stunning. It's both delicate and sturdy. The craftsman's shift is beautiful, in what you would expect a piece to cost four times this amount. The stone is beautiful and large, without being gaudy.It's a stunning piece of work. All you lads out there, should buy this for you lass, and make her very happy!Wonderful piece I highly recommend for quality and price.

14909,"I received this on Saturday and was very impressed. Not too heavy, but Not light weight. They say, you get what you pay for, I got more, much more!! It was just what I was looking for. Also, very fast shipping, which I really liked!! Thanks so much ... I would definitely tell all my friends.

17926,"I received this ring as an anniversary present and love it. I wear a lot of animal prints and brown and the smoky-quartz looks great. Really love the 3-stone shapes which are different and the cut is beautiful. This ring gets a lot of compliments!
",5
13630,"I received this ring as an anniversary present from my boyfriend and I absolutely love it!!! It really does have a ton of sparkle! After reading the reviews, I did expect it to be shiny, but it certainly exceeded my expectations! I would definitely recommend buying this ring to anyone! Not only will it make a wonderful anniversary present, but it would make a beautiful wedding band as well. The ring is slim, elegant, very comfortable and definitely looks expensive (would have never guessed it is worth only $216)!!! I've been to many jewelry stores and to be honest, I did not find a single diamond band I liked and they were all at least $600. This one is perfect! I cannot stop staring at it, especially at the right light, when I almost get blinded by the rainbow-colored sparkles! My friends are so jealous! :)

13440,"I recently discovered Swarovski Crystals and fell in love. This necklace ia absolutally beautiful and an excellant bargin. I've priced these crystals other places and this is a superior product at a great price.
",5
15352,"I recently got married and was looking for a good band for myself. I purchased this one and am very impressed. It feels good and is very light despite the size. it is comfortable and stands up to the rigors of the work of a mechanic. I have yet to scratch it. also, when it is washed with simple soap and water, the ring really shines. The only complaint I have about this ring is that dirt has a tendency to get trapped in the grooves and it cannot be re-sized (like all titanium bands). but if you can get over that, this is the best way to go for a work horse that looks classy
",5
16964,"I recently purchased these 14k 4mm gold ball earrings. They are exactly as described. I wanted them for my 2nd pierced ear hole. They are 4mm so they are on the small side which is perfect for the 2nd earring in an adult earlobe and for a child's pierced ear. I leave them in all the time, and have not been disappointed. Note: On my PC screen, the posts look like they have screw-like threads which I had wondered about. In person, the posts are smooth like regular posts so it must just be the resolution of the picture.

12868,"I refill my own HP printer ink cartridges after they run out of ink. Sometimes the ink in the cartridges dries out and even after refilling, the ink will not flow through and print. So, I purchased the Ultrasonic Cleaner thinking that it might help clean them out. It worked perfectly! I've now salvaged all my old cartridges for refilling and saved hundreds of dollars over the cost of buying new ink cartridges.The Ultrasonic Cleaner instructions were easy to follow and the product was easy to use. It took just a few minutes to set up and use the product the first time after unpacking it.

14975,"I saw a similar chandelier earring at a store and was shocked at the price. This pair from 1928 is not only well made, but gorgeous! It is stunning and has just the right amount of sparkle. It would look great with hair down or up. They are not overbearing at all and very light weight. I'm glad I ordered them because they look vintage and look terrific with jeans or dresses.
",5
13067,"I saw these online and thought they looked like a cute, inexpensive gift to give to my sister. Considering the price, they look even better in person. Not cheap looking. You cannot tell from the picture, but they are actually see through (the design is not set against a metal backing like i originally thought when ordering them). I think they're great, especially considering the price.

Trust me, buy more than one because it also makes a wonderful gift and can be worn on any finger. Worth every penny & love this seller, awesome products & great communication!! Thanks so much, I will buy here again.

17741,"I seem to be drawn to jewelry from Silver Insanity. These earrings were so pretty and my daughter-in-law loved them! I like the prices and styles of jewelty from this company, and these earrings shipped the day after I made my order and arrived in less than a week. I would recommend this particular shop if you are looking for good quality, different, and reasonably priced jewelry.

17417,"I sent my sweetheart a link to this last Valentine's Day and he bought it for me (Whatta guy!). I put it on my own gold chain and have worn it daily ever since. I get tons of compliments on it and the funny thing is, most people don't see the horns until I point them out. I recently bought some earring to compliment this necklace. I didn't think I would wear it daily, but I love it THAT much! This is a winner, guys! I know your sweetheart would love it (even if she doesn't email it to you!).
",5
18626,"I showed this pendant to my husband to see what he thought of it. He really liked it and purchased it for me for Mother's Day. I like it better in person that online. The silver is beautiful and it is the perfect size. I have seen others like it in gold and have not liked all of them. It was such a good price that it makes an easy give to give.
",5
15443,"I simply adore this pendant. It is a fascinating piece of jewelry especially in this era when there is such concern about global warming and conservation of natural resources. On numerous occasions it has sparked conversations and can be worn with a t-shirt and jeans to a nice little black cocktail dress.This is not a piece that is interchangeable and I don't recommend trying to jimmy the latch. It's only meant to be decorative. I haven't mussed with mine as I've read others have done and haven't had any problems or concerns with its integrity.
",5
17334,"I spent a lot of time (both online and in stores) searching for a good deal on a white gold chain and couldnt touch one for under $160 on sale in a store. I decided to take a chance in ordering one from Amazon and am VERY happy I did. The chain is of good quality, very sparkly (like diamonds) and beautiful. It is perfect for a small pendant or to wear by itself. I would definatley recommend this necklace to everyone.. :)
",5
17769,"I spent a lot of time shopping for the perfect chain to go with a pricey pendant I bought for my daughter and finally purchased this one. So happy I did. She loves it -- she's very jewelry savvy, having bought pieces all over the world.Also, I bought rather late for Christmas delivery, but the chain got there on time, all the way across the country. I'll check this vendor first next time I want casual jewelry.
",5
15928,"I suggested this as a gift for my wife from the girls, who are always asking for this and that. My wife's favorite response for years has been ""Yeah, when I get a gold monkey"". There are several monkey charms available, but none that match the detail and ""heft"" of this one. My wife was pretty much speechless when she opened it and realized that she would have to come up with some other excuse. You will want a heavier chain for this.
",5
16577,"I surprised her on Christmas Morning with these petite beauties. She was looking for a little splash of color that could be worn comfortably all the time. At the time of this review she has been wearing them non-stop, slept and even showered with them. I would recommend them, if these are the type of earrings your partner likes.
",5

",5
17370,"I tell you all, this has to be the best thing I have ever purchaced for my wife! She loves it! She has had it now for over a year and its still 100% perfect! Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic! It attracts more attention than any of her other jewlery (say that for this price about anything else? I think not!) even more than her jewlery from Mirano Italy! If there were earrings to match I would get them for her in a heartbeat!

",5
15936,"I think the garnet earrings are even nicer than they looked in the picture.
",5
15888,"I think the picture of this ring hides nothing. The area where the little diamonds are on the sides of the ring is smooth and shiny silver, while the other parts have the ""brushed silver"" effect. The main diamond is set down in, it doesn't stick up much at all, which is perfect for people who are active with their hands but don't want to take their rings off all of the time. It really is a gorgeous item. I would def. recommend this to anyone, and also the seller Gem Avenue. Great merchandise for great price!!!!!
",5
17117,"I think the title says it all! The posts are fine and I don't feel that they are too thick at all. These earrings are comfortable and elegant. In response to the two negative reviews based on the size of the hoops, I would recommend that all intelligent buyers READ the dimensions in order to avoid disappointment. I can't believe that people would negatively rate an item because they were ignorant and failed to read the description. The description is very accurate and I am very happy with these earrings. You won't be disappointed with the quality of these earrings.

15337,"i thought this necklace was going to have bigger beads somehow, but it's stil a pretty piece.
",5
17306,"I thought this would be a necklace with larger beads in the middle, and smaller beads towards the end. Alas, all the beads are the same. Even tho it has beads all the same size, it is a fine necklace and I am glad I bought it. It looks very nice and has been a fun necklace to wear. I MUST get in and check to see what other goodies this company has to offer!
",5
14760,"I totally disagree with the reviewer of May 12, 2007. These simply were not the earrings she had hoped for. For me, they were exactly what I wanted. I am a short person with short hair and like to wear small, feminine earrings. I am also very active (bicycle, cross-country ski, swim) and need something that will stay put. The Secure Hoop Diamond Gypsy-Setting Hoop Earrings are meeting all my needs. What impresses the heck out of me is that CoolStyles (in Florida) got these earrings to me (in Michigan) on the 4th business day after I placed my order. I believe they had the best price on the 'net as well.
",5
16552,"I treated myself to a pair of these last week after having admired them over the last few months. I was not disappointed when they arrived. Classy looking and the quality is quite remarkable.
",5
18376,"I tried to buy this stone in the UK but couldn't find one with a gold chain anywhere. was a little concerned about the size of the stone but it's better than I expected. The gold chain is a little thin but it all looks great.
",5
15792,"I use this as an anklet. Though I should have gotten a shorter length (it is very loose and falls too low on my ankle), that is my fault. But I've already worn it for a year and a half and it is still holding up great. The quality is fantastic and it's very stylish.
",5
12848,"I use this to clean my atomizers for my vapor pipe the ego-t. I use Vodka and it cleans them great. It works well with water too when clening all metals.

57876,"I used these items for decoration on a birthday cake and they worked out perfect !They were the size I was looking for and the quanity was correct.I was very happy with the delivery date.
",5
15640,"I used this in an Uryu Ishida costume for my 11 year old son. It's a beautiful piece that looks just like Uryu's cross in the anime.The chain and clasp are nice and sturdy. Both held up to a lot of fidgeting and fiddling with. The only slight apprehension I have about the necklace is that it's made out of metal, but I'm not sure what kind or whether there's any lead content in it. A few years back, there was an issue with imported jewelry, so just to be on the safe side, I wouldn't let a child or teenager wear this against their skin for extended periods of time. Aside from that caution, this is wonderful and worth every penny.
",5
16288,"I used this ring to try out the size and width for a couple weeks before buying my wedding ring. The jeweler sized it and said the size was spot on. My only complaint is that it is not a comfort fit. This causes some discomfort when wearing it and taking it off, but I knew that before I bought it so I am still rating it a 5.
",5
15922,"I usually don't write reviews, but these earrings deserve one. I gasped when I took them out of their package and tried them on. They're perfect--not too big, not too small, and they'll match the necklace I was looking for them to match perfectly. Great pair, and the price is fantastic. Don't skip on this pair of earrings! You'll be sorry if you do.
",5
14513,"I usually wear a claddagh on my right hand .... but it cracked from years of wear and tear. I could not seem to find any that I liked, so I began to explore options such as celtic knots - and more specifically the trinity knot. I did not have a lot to spend, and I'm very particular - it can't be too big, and obviously I wouldn't want something so small it's a waste of money.The ring came fast, well packed, and I was excited. Because there were no half-sizes, I had to order half size up (I wasnt' willing to have it too tight) and I love it!!!! I wouldn't call it overly dainty - but it's a nice contemporary - but classic look and the finish is nice. It complements my very simple wedding band and solitaire without going overboard.I TOTALLY recommend this ring to anyone that has sentiment in the Trinity knot, or the holy Trinity.
",5
13303,"I very much like these earings. I got them for my sister and she loves them as well. They get noticed a lot because they are just the perfect size and they are so unique and unusual.
",5
19736,"I waited a long time for these to be shipped and quite honestly, I signed on to cancel the order only to find they were finally preparing for shipment. Since I'd ordered them as an early August birthday gift and it then was almost September, these became no longer a gift for this year. In December, someone else will receive a lovely pair of pretty green peridot earrings that can be worn every day. They are of a very fine quality that I would definitely wear myself. I see nothing to criticize about either these bright stones or the well-made yellow gold earrings. Nicely matched, too.
",5
19151,"I waited much too long to order the bracelet and expect it by Christmas. I was extremely surprised and delighted that it arrived in the mail on Christmas Eve, even though I expected it several days after Christmas. The item was packaged extremely well and was exactly as I imagined it would look. Needless to say, my wife was thrilled when she opened up the package on Christmas day. Thank you so much for such a quick turnaround!
",5
16650,"I wanted a 1"" gold hoop and found it with these earrings. The gold is shiny and beautiful. The clasp is solid and stays together. It is hard to find this size hoop. These are replacing a very large pair my husband bought me for Christmas. (They were so huge that I looked like DUMBO!)These are perfect to wear for dress-up or casual. I wear lot of turtlenecks so was looking for a pair that would not get caught all the time in them. This is the perfect size.I also have very short hair - so these earrings complement my hair style without overpowering me.They are also very comfortable - so much so that I sometimes forget I have earrings on.Buy with confidence. These earrings will delight anyone looking for a decent quality and reasonably sized gold hoop.
",5
14293,"I wanted a charm with my son's name on it, but couldn't find one in stores. I love this charm, it's perfect.
",5
16612,"I wanted a pair of smaller gold earrings for every day wear. These are perfect.The hoop is small, but makes a nice impression on the ear. I have forgotten I have them on and have worn them to bed, which is something I never do with earrings. If you want a smaller size hoop that is noticable on the ear and not overpowering, these are perfect.
",5
14762,"I wanted a perfect hoop earring without a post sticking out the back. This hoop is very comfortable and perfect size. I do not wear earings normally but was able to wear this without taking it off for days. The 3 little diamonds give a very subtle shine which is also very attractive.
",5
18262,"I wanted a plain, comfortable yet relatively substantial wedding band and that is exactly what I got with this ring! I ordered it on 10/17 and have it on my finger as I write this review on 10/22 -- pretty speedy shipping. I am really pleased with the quality! The comfort fit makes it so comfortable that I barely feel the ring at all which is GREAT! Highly recommend!!
",5
19686,"I wanted a red Italian charm bracelet, and this is the only one I found. I like it. To make it fancier, I could substitute some of the Zoppini red oval links, but they cost as much each as this whole bracelet.
",5
12579,"I wanted an ear cuff for so long, so I finally bit the bullet and bought this one! I love it! People are always asking me if it's real and complimenting me on it. I wanted to look edgy without having to commit to a permanent piercing or tattoo, so this was the perfect compromise.
",5
16658,"I wanted hoops that were not too small and not too big and as light as possible. These fit the bill perfectly. They are attractive and feel weightless.

19275,"I wanted something small to hold my earrings and really enjoy being able to see through the case to make a quick selection. I also have small hoops that I can also store in the case. I'm pleased that I ordered this case.
",5
13637,"I wanted something stunning to wear to my son's wedding. This was it !!...well made and absolutely beautiful.
",5
13495,"I wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring. When it arrived, I really was in awe of just how beautiful it is! It is a larger, more bold ring - definitely more masculine. This is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love.It's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12. Hopefully I can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice!

19041,"I wanted to create a family italian charm bracelet with my daughters first and middle names. I could find my other daugther's first name, but I could not find Jocelyn anywhere, especially spelled like this. My bracelet is complete, and I can wear a token of my family every day!

19086,"I wanted to find something that would keep my earrings from tangling, and keep them easy to find. The display is attractive, you can always see your earrings, and they don't get tangled with each other.

13421,"I wanted to get a friend something to let her know she was still beautiful even if she was now bald. She loved them and couldn't stop looking at them in the mirror, mission accomplished!
",5
12660,"I wanted to surprise my wife with a little gift and this charm fit the bill. She absolutely adores our Italian Greyhound and the charm is nearly as cute as our little guy. The face is very faithful to the loving look of an IG and any owner of an IG will recognize it instantly. If I had to nitpick about the item at all, I would simply point out that a slightly larger charm might be nice in order to show off the little details that put into the face.I am very happy with this purchase and the vendor shipped the item extremely quickly (the item arrived a few days before the estimated arrival date if I recall correctly). I'd purchase items again from this vendor.

16681,"I wanted to treat myself to some nice classic gold hoop earrings but not spend a fortune, well i read the reviews and ordered this set, really beautiful and it comes in a beatiful velvelt dark blue box, i love them and you can tell they are not cheap either, highly recommended, they are about 1 inch in diameter, not heavy at all and not big hoopy looking...thanks Amazon.............Melanie...happy customer.

13771,"i wanted to write a review on this product but i lost one of the earrings within 24 hours of wearing them. i was very very sad..... THEN!!! i found the earring in my garden but the clasp was not working properly and that's why it fell out of my ear.so, i contacted the seller and they sent me a new pair right away!what great customer service!!!!!the earrings are gorgeous!!!!beautiful and classy with anything you wear.

17881,"I was a bit sceptical when I saw this was a created ruby but took a chance and ordered it and am glad I did. The ""ruby"" is a very nice color and the way it is made with the addition of the cubic zeconias is very attractive. It came in attractive gift packaging and this was very nice as well....
",5
13163,"I was a little apprehensive about buying jewelry (esp. diamonds) online, but I must say I was very impressed with this journey pendant. The diamonds were very sparkly, it was the perfect size for my wife, and most importantly, she loved it. What else is there to say?On a side note, I purchased a pair of stud diamond earrings from [..], and though the value was also very good, I was disappointed in their clarity. They were not near as beautiful as the ones in this piece.

16942,"I was a little hesitant about this purchase. It turned out to be like the Sam's Club ones I had been looking at, but cheaper. And I do like the locking ""click"".
",5
17191,"I was a little hesitant to order earrings over via web as I wasn't able to judge them on the quality, however, after spending a small fortune on earrings over the years only to have them dented and bent in a month or two, I figured I would give them a go - they were actually CHEAPER than the other crap I have brought and thrown away over the years due to breakage or denting.First off, compared to the earrings found in Australia, these are INCREDIBLE! They are sooooo much more solid than any of the hollow crap that I have purchased in Australia over the years. They are light but at the same time feel quite solid, not flimsy at all, and the catch is very strong.I have read a lot of reviews about the posts being too thick, I'm not sure what the posts are normally like in the US, however, the posts that come on these earrings are exactly the types of posts that are on ALL earrings here in Australia, so I can't really comment on them being too thick as that is what I am used to.I'm so impressed I am saving up IMMEDIATELY for the smaller pair. Perfect earrings, top quality and a great price!
",5
13450,"I was a little hesitant to order these online.... The last time I ordered blue diamonds online (not from Amazon), they came so dark and cloudy that I returned them. Fortunately, these earrings are nothing like my previous order. These earrings are fantastic! Gorgeous color, great sparkle, better than I could have imagined! Highly recommended if you're looking for a pair.
",5
19742,"I was a little leary purchasing jewelry like this from anywhere online. I couldn't find in stores so I decided to go ahead. The picture does them no justice, they are beautiful in person. And you can't complain about the price!
",5
16491,"I was a little skeptical purchasing jewelry online, but when this came in I was very pleased. This is definitely more stunning in person. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother. It looks absolutely fabulous on her!
",5
16685,"I was a little worried about ordering these earrings without actually seeing them in person. I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of these earrings. I couldn't find earrings with this quality anywhere for this price. They look like they cost over $100 easy. I would recommend these to anyone.
",5
15832,"I was actually suprised at how happy I was when I received these collar stays. When I first opened the package, I was disheartened by their size - since they appeared too wide to fit into any of my shirts... but alas - they fit perfectly! It's a tight fit, not so tight that it would damage my shirt, but tight enough to have the confidence that you won't loose them voluntarily. Thick enough not to bend unintentionally, like some collar stays I've had, not to mention the weight, as aforementioned in another review - give a professional appearance. Overall, an excellent, and highly recommended product.
",5
14575,"I was afraid that I would be dissatisfied with the purchase..I am both frugal and picky. I was afraid it would be too small, or featherlight hollow.I was really surprised to find this would be everything I hoped it to be. It is definitely larger then a quarter. It is of the quality I would expect from a jewelry store.The recipient, loved it and I have not seen it off her neck since.I would be confident buying from this seller.
",5
17123,"I was almost scared to order these earrings online because I wasn't sure of the size. I do not like really big hoop earrings and I thought these would be too big when I received them. They came in today and they are very nice. Just the perfect size for me and I am very pleased.I would also like to add that I got the free shipping because they were over 25 bucks and I still received them fast. They were also packaged very nicely. I would definately recommend these earrings to anyone who likes white gold.
",5
19646,"I was concerned about buying this from Amazon, but was nicely surprised! A wonderful ring for the price - diamonds are sparkly and just right for an accent piece next to a solitare or wedding ring...or even alone! Guys get this for your gal...Ladies buy it for yourself! It is a sweet little piece - happy birthday to me! : )

15484,"I was delighted with the quality! They are delicate, not imposing looking. My daughter-in-law will LOVE them. Thanks for the prompt delivery too!
",5
14976,"I was delighted with this purchase. These are beautiful, and can be used for dressier or more casual wear. The color is neutral enough that they'll match with quite a few shades. The quality is good, they're comfortable enough for all-day use, and they're a good size. Not too large or too small. The photo is nice, but these are even prettier in person.
",5
15588,"I was eyeing this earing for quite sometime...and I ordered it...came in a little box..and Oh it was the cutest earings ever! however you might want to note that in the picture the stones look red..but it's actually a little lighter..slightly on the pinkish side..but they are so beautiful! i am wearing them almost every day now!:)

18857,"I was impressed with the quality and detail of the ring. The person I bought it for loves it, and as a jeweler herself, that says alot. I was afraid of the metals when I bought it, but she has had no problems. Overall the ring is a gorgeous imitation of history and I would highly recommend it and the company I bought it from.
",5
13021,"I was impressed with the quality of these stud earrings. And the price was nice, too. The garnets were a pretty deep wine red color. And the setting was sturdy-something I truly value, because I had ordered another pair of studs from a separate seller on Amazon about the same time and was very disappointed. Definitely worth it and I would order from this seller again. Keep up the good work, guys!

13188,"I was in love with this practice from the first time I tried it, and I suspect that most yoga students who share my level (intermediate) and preferences (slowly flowing yoga with lots of hip openers and twists but few backbends) will also share my opinion here. Instructor Tilak Pyle has studied under Erich Schiffmann, and it shows, as this video has a very similar feel to Schiffmann's classic Yoga Mind and Body. The video was filmed in the Blue Ridge Mountains, with Tilak and his four assistants each appearing in a different outdoor location. The scenery is gorgeous and worth a watch of the video on its own, as you are likely to miss much while actually doing the practice. The music, which includes selections by Krishna Das and Jai Uttal, is also beautiful and lends a soulful element to the practice. The entire practice is about 85 minutes long, but it is chaptered and can be broken into shorter segments (see below).As a nice change of pace to most other yoga videos, Altar begins in a seated position, starting with a brief meditation and moving into simple seated forward bends. You then come to standing, but instead of going right into sun salutations, Tilak leads you through several balance postures (tree, eagle) as well as half sun salutes. Following this is a flowing lunge series which includes a moving ""liquid"" lunge and low lunge with forearms on the floor (lizard pose). The first standing series consists of warrior 1, 2, triangle, and side angle; short vinyasas are performed between each series, but not between every posture. After plank/side plank, there is a second standing series focused more on balance postures: pyramid, warrior 3, and half moon. Next, you'll move into dog pose, open your hips, and then continue with pigeon. This is followed by a short child's pose series which includes several shoulder stretches and then a brief savasana. Since this is about the 45 minute mark, if you don't have time for the entire practice, you can stop here, but you probably won't want to!The second half of the practice begins with a spread leg standing adductor stretch and then moves into standing wide-legged forward bend. Next you'll lie on your back for reclined leg stretches, including hand to foot and thread the needle. From a seated position, you'll perform rock the baby and a forward fold with cat/dog tilt. Next comes headstand, which Tilak and company perform unsupported, but there is enough setup time to use a wall. Headstand is held for several breaths, and then another child's pose and a brief pause follow. The final segment of the practice begins with seated forward bends and moves into shoulderstand, lying and seated twists, yoga mudra, and finally, relaxation pose. The asana practice ends here (75 minutes), but Tilak allows an additional 10 minutes for a long savasana, pranayama (alternate nostril breathing and retention), and final meditation.Bonuses on this video include a detailed asana list, offered in both Sanskrit and English, and ""deleted scenes"" (bloopers). Don't miss this last section: Tilak and crew are hilarious as they struggle with uneven surfaces, wind, bugs, external noise, and the like. Throughout the practice, Tilak is a soothing, calming presence. He cues poses in both Sanskrit and English, and his voiceover guidance is excellent (only occasionally moving slightly out of sync with the screen). While his instruction is not overly detailed (this is an intermediate practice, after all), he does provide very helpful form pointers. Overall, this is a beautiful, well-done practice and highly recommended as a must-have addition to your yoga media collection.

My girfriend told me she doesn't like anything but diamonds and I was kind of skeptical about how she is going to react to something that isn't. She loved it - she is wearing it almost every day. I also got a pair of matching earings to go with it as a set. Great quality.

They're large enough to be noticed through long hair and are perfect for either casual or dressy outfits. I agree with the other reviewers regarding the clasp, be careful when opening and closing but it's definitely secure once clicked into place. Great value for the money.

[ hardly worth the bother to change a price ]so, i stumbled upon these at this site. they cost me $82 a pair [ and that was with 24 hour delivery ] also, they matched the single hoop i bought from the other site exactly.if you are searching for a small gold hoop with very simple design [ they are a bit smaller than a dime and are just a plain golden ring ] than these are what you are looking for. the actual price is $59.99.

16725,"I was looking for a replacement for a pair of hoops I have had a long time, (the closure had broken.) These earrings exceeded my expectations! The price was good, too, as we all know the price of gold has sky-rocketed. After I received them, I saw they are made by Leach & Garner. I have other gold pieces manufactured by them that are built to last. You can tell the difference. I don't know what alloys they use, but I like the color of the 14k and the durability. Hopefully, I will have this pair as long as I had the other ones, (or longer!)

But if youre looking for something smaller with simple elegance, this is the one for you!

They are the perfect shade of gold, slightly on the light side, not that vivid orange-y color that you see on a lot of gold-plated things. They matched my other 14k pieces perfectly. The quality is excellent for the price! A lot of customers have commented about the backs being small or delicate. Yes, they are small, but they fit tightly and are very secure. I have lots of 14k gold studs, and most of them have the same small backs, so these are nothing unusual. Overall, super glad I bought them! Couldn't be happier!! You can't go wrong buying from Amazon.

19631,"I was looking for some citrine earrings on the Amazon website and was taken by these. I would disagree with the description of them on the Amazon site - ""cute"" does not characterize the elegance of these earrings. The citrine and freshwater pearl work well together. I was surprised when I opened the package - these earrings are larger than the impression one gets from the picture. And they are substantial. My suggestion is that you obtain some washer-style backs to keep the earrings up on the ear lobe (they are a bit weighty and tend to fall forward - at least on me). I wore them for the first time at work (at a well known cosmetics corporation) and got loads of compliments. The #1 compliment was, ""They're so glamorous."" They certainly are.

If you like the picture of this on Amazon, YOU WILL LOVE IT LIVE AND AROUND YOUR NECK.

13265,"I was pleasantly surprised with how nice these look hanging from my ears. I read the positive reviews and took a chance. The earings are just as Amazon describes them. Another reviewer wrote about the convex curve to the earrings and it does add a nice shine to the earrings. Also the small oval can be moved to the front or to the back of the large oval by threading it through the larger oval. All of the loops and jump rings are soldered closed. Earrings came in a navy velvet pouch inside of a navy box.

They are printed on the marble with great quality and do not have any sign of peeling off at any time at all. They are not overlapped in any way!

My wife has very slender toes and had to squeeze the ring all the way closed, but it fits very nicely and she has worn it since she received it this summer.

I was concerned about the name going on the pendant but they responded a couple of times and made the cartouche the way I wanted. The piece seems well made and I am happy with it. It came within 2 weeks of ordering it, as well, ahead of schedule. I will definitely consider ordering again from this company.

18588,"I was very pleased with this purchase. It far exceeded my expectations. The most appealing thing about this necklace is the flexability . It lays so pretty on the neck. This is my second purchase of this product. I gave a friend one for a gift and she loves it.

",5
18487,"I was very satisfied with this ring and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for simple black onyx ring-jewelry. This ring is cold and heavy so I believe it is a real gemstone - no plastic for sure.

13170,"I was very surprised and pleased when this product arrived earlier then the earliest estimated shipping date. The product is beautiful and of high quality. I highly recommend this product and any product from this manufacturer.
",5
15142,"I was worried that a solid necklace would be annoying and somehow pinchy or too heavy to be comfortable, but I figured I'd take a chance on this because I had a gift certificate and it looked cool. It's substantial enough to not feel like it's going to break, yet light enough not to notice too much when it's on.
",5
13013,"I wasn't expecting much given the price. One doesn't get much 14K gold for $18 these days. I was pleasantly surprised with the pendant's size and sturdiness. It looks nice on a fine box chain. Well worth the money.
",5
16727,"I wasn't sure what these would like when I ordered them; since they appear almost silver on screen, but I trusted it's description of being 14K. I was very happy when I received them. They are 14k yellow gold and surprisingly sturdy/strong. They are polished and look high-quality. Very happy with this purchase!
",5
16032,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this ring, but have been pleasantly suprised thus far.The materials and craftsmanship definitely exceed the price paid for it. It it really does gives the appearance of looking more expensive than it actually is. It is comfortable to wear runs and true-to-size.The enameled design is finely done. From a distance it could look like tiny sapphires. I don't know the technical term, but where CZ is set there is actually a cut out, in the ring, behind the stone, it for maximum sparkle.
",5
19080,"I wear clip-on earrings and it's been a real problem trying to organize them (unless I wanted to put them in flat trays that take up lots of room) - this e/r display holder has been fabulous! Now I can keep the clutter off the top of my dresser and see everything I've got (well almost, I think I need to get another one) at the same time -- I love it!!!
",5
13470,"I wear it every day. Fits my skinny toe. It also adjust to any toe size.
",5
14906,"I wear it everyday and wouldn't trade it for anything. It not only has held up very well but I get at least one ""how beautiful!"" a day. It's difficult to find beautiful Phoenix jewelry and there's none better than this piece.
",5
19093,"I wear lots of smaller size earrings. This holder is large enough to hold about 70 pair of small to medium-size earrings, as well as those that dangle if they aren't longer than an inch or so. It's very classy black metal - nicely made. I'm glad I bought two so I have one for a gift for my sister for Christmas!
",5
13160,"I wear my pendant each and EVERY day! I love it. I did purchase a longer box chain for it though.
",5
17179,"I wear plain gold hoop earrings almost everyday and over the years I have lost many earrings. After another recent loss, I purchased both the white and yellow 14K gold hoop earrings. I have paid far more than the $29 price for 10K hoops of far inferior quality. Because they were so inexpensive, I did wonder if I'd want to return them once they arrived. I was very pleasantly surprised. Unlike most, these are heavy, don't appear to be ""hollow"" and the clasp snaps in well so I don't worry about losing one. I love both pairs. I highly recommend them and would purchase them again without hesitation.
",5
16554,"I wear them almost everyday. They are a very classic style and not a great big hoop that falls out of style as soon as you buy them. When I first bought them I thought they might be a little to small but after I put them on they were just right.
",5
13742,"I wear these earrings all the time! Have the right amt. of bling for the day and plenty for a night out too! For the price, I could not be happier. Perfect size too, can sleep with them, even wear a motorcycle helmet and not feel them! Only change, would be to make the latch more secure ( so far, only came loose when I take off my helmet).
",5
13575,"I would highly recommend ordering from amazon again. My product came fast and I was pleased with the overall quality. The only thing I wish would have been in the description is the length of the bracelet.

15870,"I would recommend this ring to anyone. I love it. Its very beautiful.I love the antique look it has. Its also very shiny. Looks like it costa fortune but it didnt. :)
",5
18468,"I would suggest getting at least a half size larger than you usually do, because stone rings don't have any ""give"" like metal rings do. I'm not positive this ring is actually onyx, but it's still very pretty. It also came in a cute little gift box. I'm very happy with this ring.
",5
19089,"I'd been looking for a while for an easy-to-use earring tree that held both post-type and wire-type earrings. I wanted it to be strong & not tip over on my dresser, yet not too utilitarian to be ugly. This product is exactly what I wanted!
",5
17008,"If they had showed a side view I would not have ordered them. They looked like a earring I was looking for not the ball. T he earings I was looking for were a half ball.
",5
17545,"If you are even considering buying this then you should definatly BUY IY! It is so much nicer than I even thought it would be. On my girlfriends neck it looks so nice and she loves it. Well worth the money.

It's cute, well made and the company that sells this tongue ring provides good customer service and fast delivery.SO if you're in the market for spring time tongue ring, I would recommend this product.

13365,"If you can get this for the sale price of 60% off, dont hesitate! Just BUY IT! You wont be disappointed!I am in my late 20s, and own MANY pieces of jewelry... mostly white gold and diamond, so we can just say. I like nice things.This is definitely one of 'em and I was very surprised when I got these! They have a very nice weight to it, looks and feel very expensive, is VERY shiny and eye catching, and very well made..not to mention the design is definitely unique and different, yet sleek and stylish.Buying jewelry online is a hit or miss; I usually end up returning 50% of my internet jewelry purchase, but I am definitely keeping these! You wont see them on anyone else!I also bought the matching pendent.

Tilak Pyle's instruction is so clear that you almost never need to look at the screen -- but you'll want to, because the scenery is breathtakingly gorgeous.

14892,"If you love the Phoenix myth you need this pendant. It is better looking in person. I put it on the moment I got it and have not took it off. It has a wonderful feel to it. Great detail. It has a positive engery to it. A must have! It was shipped to me the day before I was told. I got it within three days. I will do more buisness with Silver Insanity again.
",5
16591,"If you scan some of the reviews about these earrings you'd think a magnifying glass should come with every pair so you could find them. Nothing could be further from the truth. They're smaller than, say, a wedding band but there's nothing flimsy or insubstantial about these lovely gold hoops.One reviewer said she loved that she could sleep in them quite comfortably, so I tried it for myself and found out that she was right. That's handy for me when I'm traveling because I'd really rather not take off my jewelry and risk losing it in the confusion of rushing from place to place.I don't recall anyone mentioning the finish, but it is exceptionally attractive and shows no sign of losing its luster after weeks of wear in all sorts of conditions. Beautiful earrings at a beautiful price.
",5
17682,"if your the simple type but you want luxury or luxury is you...then so is this ring...even if luxury doesn't suit you...I GUARANTEE it will LOOK GREAT ON YOU...make sure you pick the right size ring, remember, your wedding finger may be smaller than your right hand, so have it professionally measured. HAPPY SHOPPING...PERFECT BUY...!!
",5
15490,"If you're into bondage and have ever wanted to wear leg irons (or you have a partner who is), then I can thoroughly recommend these.I found them easily adjustable and when they're double-locked in place they fit me very snugly and securely, but without giving me the sensation of having my ankles sliced off! Walking in them is feasible enough as long as I watch where I'm putting my feet, but anything even vaguely acrobatic such as running or kicking is right out of the question. The steel round my ankles is heavy and substantial, and the chain rattles against a hard floor - these are not some flimsy toy!The longest I've had them on so far without a break is about eight hours, but I'd suggest building up to that gradually - taking care of course to avoid soreness or swelling of the feet. They come with two keys, so the first thing I did was to separate them and put the spare key somewhere safe - DON'T lose the keys or else you'll be getting the Fire Brigade round to cut them off!They'd be far too much just as a fancy dress accessory, but if you want to experience for yourself the sensation of having to wear leg irons, then get some!
",5
14064,"Ignore amazons description. It's wrong. It's not a Claddagh ring. I have used their contact form to try and get this corrected but to no avail. It's a straight Celtic knotwork Ring and a fine one! There is no marchasite as the description says, but a Sterling Silver ring. The band is very wide 10.80 millimetres. The image show a black back to the scroll work, this is not quite true. It's dark, but silver.The design is intricate and cut/stamped (?) deeply. Well worth three times the price.
",5
13766,"I'm a guy and i just received this, not too big not too small i wear this on the top part of my ear ""cartilage""... would definitely recommend these for those who want the small hoop around the top part of the ear... comes with a pair so if you loose one you'll have a back up...very fast shipping great deal.
",5
13590,"I'm a professional musician and bought these cufflinks to wear with my tuxedo at various concerts throughout the year. I've had them for about a year now, and I would have to say that they were well worth the price. (definitely better than the $200 or more alternatives) I have used them several times and haven't had any problems with chipping, breaking, etc. like some of the other reviews mention. Don't be scared off by some of the other reviews; these are great cufflinks and definitely worth the price. I highly recommend them.
",5
16728,"I'm a typical guy that is basically clueless about jewelry, but I can certainly appreciate the ease of buying something on Amazon as opposed to going to a jewelry store and dealing with salespeople trying to push expensive products. My favorite move is when they take out their calculator and magically apply some unknown discount to what may or may not be a sticker price. My wife absolutely loved these earings - I don't know exactly why - but if your loved one is asking for gold hoop earrings these are the real deal.
",5
17800,"I'm always looking for nice stud earrings. Besides, garnets are one of my favorite stones. I love their special shade of red that makes them very pleasing to the eye. These dainty earrings are very lovely and well made. They are very comfortable to wear too. I could have gotten the larger ones but 5mm are perfect for when I want to dress up my ears without feeling like I'm overdoing it. They are simple yet they shine beautifully. I got these earrings when they were on sale for $19.99 and if I see them on sale again, I'll probably buy another pair to give away next Christmas.
",5
15737,"I'm blown away by the quality of these pearls. Of course, it's not perfect, and there are minor flaws. The flaws are so minute, you would have to be close and look for them.In my opinion, to get a perfect pearl necklace would require a lot of money. I think the flaws, to a certain extent, give the necklace character. The luster is incredibly high. The uniformity is pretty close to perfect. I think this was an excellent buy.

18065,"I'm posting actual pics, so you can tell the size... It's not huge, but for 1/4 cttw, what do you expect? For the color (J-K) this is actually quite clear, and you cannot see any occlusions in the diamonds. They are not cloudy, and the look is pretty awesome. I debated for months over which right hand ring to buy and for $87, this is well worth the price! You own't be disappointed!!
",5
16534,"I'm quite happy with these and writing to say so, because other users' comments were very helpful to me--especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial: i.e., though diminutive, they have bulk so are visible, with nice warm glow.

",5
19765,"I'm very pleased with this purchase, especially having bought them during an Amazon sale. The blue is clear and bright, the setting is secure, and they fit well on the ears. The post is a little higher than center so I often find myself turning them to be sure they are falling correctly, but it really doesn't make a difference. The white gold really complements the blue and I much prefer these set in white rather than yellow gold because of the very cool color of the stones. For those who have light colored eyes, these are especially complementary. I have received numerous compliments when wearing these and I wear these very, very often, sometimes not removing them for weeks at a time.

17555,"It is a beautiful necklace, very shiny and impressive looking. Looks a lot more expensive than the real price. The ruby stone color is rich and bright. The cz diamonds give it a lot of blink. It is just the right size to wear with a V neck or high neck gown. Excellent quality for the price.

13177,"It is a very nice looking opal ring that is not too small or too gaudy. I like the fillagree style and colorful stone. The diamonds are too small to really make a fuss over, but does give a nice sparkle touch.I ended up getting a full size too large, which may have helped me because the band is really thin, and making it smaller I beleive thickened it.Overall I am very pleased, the jeweler complimented on it and I dont think he would have guessed it was at this price.--- 5 year review ----The ring is still worn from my then girlfriend to my now wife, whis was only a birthday ring at the time and she still wears it. The gold has held up very well, no need to re-plate it yet but the opal unfortunately popped out at the ""two-can"" house at Litchfield beach couple years ago and we replaced it with a sapphire. the fittings were still tight so I assume the opal fractured and fell out. I learned that opals are a soft stone and can fall out or break more easily than other harder stones.5 stars, opals can break.. ring still great.

15984,"It's cold here in the Northeast, and that makes my fingers shrink. So, my wedding ring has been flying off and landing in unfortunate places (under the couch, in the washing machine, in my baby's diaper!). So I ordered this ring in 4 sizes so I could use it to hold my ring on no matter how small my finger shrinks. It's PERFECT! Great customer service and shipping too. It left LA on Friday and arrived in NY on Monday via USPS! Great service, great ring, great price.
",5
13142,"It's easy to read the title quickly and ignore the longer description. 1/2 carats is the approximate total weight of the 7 diamonds, not the weight per diamond. At first, this ""journey"" pendant appeared diminutive to my eyes. It's not the pendulous chain of rocks Richard Burton would have purchased for Elizabeth Taylor, but it's luminescent, alluring, and guaranteed to sparkle in the eyes of the receiver. It's also an undeniable value at this price--high-quality diamonds carefully mounted, arranged, and strung. As for the number ""7"" and the slightly shortened length of the chain (accounting for the slight curve in the pendant), those details are not accidental, incidental, random or flawed. They're integral with the numerology and symbolism of the journey design. (The owner may wish to research the meanings for herself, though the imagination can do just as well.)

17512,"It's got 17 little garnets throughout the necklace, and once I put it on I couldn't stop looking at it. It's even prettier than the picture! The garnet color is good, and in my opinion the sterling silver could easily pass for white gold. I can't wait to wear this out! :)
",5
17642,"it's just a little bit bigger than a quarter and probably 3 times thicker. i really like the details, where one metal is cut and placed over another. bronze over copper? the cuts in the metal are fine, crisp, but will not cut you. the metal underneath has lots of character, some dark shades and a brushed-type finish. so it's still rustic looking but not to the point where it looks cheap. it looks well-made. the metal surrounding it (pewter maybe?) is perfect to keep the rustic look. if it was a bright shiney metal, it would ruin the effect. love the price too!
",5
12824,"It's just what I needed. The timer goes up to 480 seconds (8-minutes). The tank capacity is 2.5-cups, whereas the other small machines I looked at are only 2-cups. The only thing I wish the manufactureres of these machines would make is a removeable tank for easy emptying and cleaning.I highly recommend the Kendal Ultrasonic machine.

17458,"Its taken me forever to find a really long necklace that looks nice, feels nice and isn't going to break after one little tug. And this is it! The rope link is stylish and delicate looking whilst still maintaining a toughness to avoid breakage. This chain looks great with any pendant hanging off of it and I'm currently deciding whether to buy another one. Probably!
",5
57866,"Its the thought counts and I bought this for my mother in law! When I opened it, I was very impressed. For the price that I paid, I thought it would look a little cheaper but it feels heavy and looks pretty. I picked out the stones of her kids and started putting them in the locket. Although i wanted to be careful as not to break the necklace so I was careful when opening the locket. Although I found that I was having a hard time opening it. I realized later that you had to take off the chain for the locket to fully open all the way. Once I did that I put her kids stones in there and tried to close it. It didnt snap shut like I expected so I started to read the little paper that came with it. I realized that I had bought the smaller locket and the smaller locket can only only four stones when the bigger locket can hold fifteen. I was worried because she has five kids. So I tried to put them all in there anyways and after I shut it as much as I could, I put the chain back on it. I realized that when the chain is on the locket, none of the stones can fall out so I was very excited that I made all five fit in there afterall! I loved it so much I went online and bought one more small locket and another large locket for two other family members:)
",5
18428,"It's very pretty and unique. The rubies are a little lighter in color than I expected...they are more like pink. But the ring is very nice nonetheless.
",5
12314,"I'v been weearing this ring for few months now as a replacement for my wedding band, and its still comfortable and looking great. It has accumulated minor scratches throughout, but that's the nature of silver and how rough I use my hands. The ring is awesome for such a low price.
",5
18562,"I've always been a fan of simple stainless steal rings, and this one is one of my favorites. It's incredibly shiny and smooth, and feels great on my finger. I wear mine as a thumb ring, and it's just beautiful. The inscription inside is very delicate and looks great when I take it off and look at the words- it always makes me smile, and remember to be happy :-) I'm very satisfied with this ring, and is one of my favorite rings.The only thing I'll say, is in the pictures, it looks as if the sides of the ring are totally rounded. They're not. It's flat and more of a square with a rounded top edge, so from the top it looks rounded, but it's actually thicker and flat on the sides. Not a big deal, but if you're expecting a thin ring with rounded sides, keep in mind this one is a little flatter on the sides, which may give it a more masculine appearance in some people's opinion. It's still a beautiful ring though, and I've gotten several compliments on it already :-)UPDATE: I've had this ring for a while now, and as others have said, the black stuff in the inscription came off, and it does look sooooo much better. It looks very expensive and much more dainty and pretty :-) It's still not very scratched (it has a few very small, light scratches that I can't see unless I really look for them), but I am very hard on my hands, so that's pretty impressive, that is still looks so great. I'm still very pleased with this ring, and it's for sure one of my favorite rings, and I wear it every day :-)

13960,"I've always been in fond of celtic stuff, and i had no idea amazon sells celtic jewelry. When i saw my celtic unicorn i immediately fell in love ,and i knew i had to have him. the design is incredibly intricate and well made, and it's not as huge as i expected (just big enough) , and looking at him makes me remember beautiful memories. My only complaint is about the silk cord, because it's too long, but everything else is just great.
",5
12166,"i've always loved celtic knot-work patterns and i was immediately drawn to this ring. i know most people would be using it as a wedding band, but i find it works beautifully as an every day ring, in fact i haven't taken it off since i got it. i was more than pleasantly surprised at the colour of the metal - sort of gun metal grey with highlights of bright silver. and it only gets more beautiful as you wear it. the ring is a little thick, so it takes a little time to get used to, but it's well worth it.

19601,"I've been buying Moissanite for a few years now. My girlfriend is very happy with the pendants and earrings I've gotten her. No problems with chips but she is not hard on her jewelry. We feel that it has a bit more color sparkle than a real diamond. We really like that. We don't like cubic zircona and feel that Moissanite looks much better. Diamonds look plain to us. CZ looks cheap. Moissanite looks great.If you want to pass it off as a diamond, you can. Her friends are amazed when she tells them her stones are not real diamonds.We really like her Moissanite jewelry. I am about to order her 4th set.

54,"I've been looking for a garnet necklace that I like forever, and I've finally found it! I disagree with the previous reviewer, I don't think it's ""costume-y"" at all. The design is lovely and classic, and I'll be wearing this for years to come.

12390,"I've been looking for a pair of inexpensive, beautiful vintage looking earrings for a Victorian Era Christmas party to go along with my black dress (yeah, it's probably focused on the Edwardian Era or even later, but fashion haven't changed drastically yet during those days. They could still get past the near-30-years difference.)To be fair, they do resemble the pictures, just that you don't actually get to touch the products. I probably won't get them if I were to be shopping in a mall, but they do the trick. Not sure how the blue and orange look, but black could definitely fool people thinking they're expensive / authentic without taking them off and examining them. Would still look good with modern dresses and outfits.

13398,"I've been searching for affordable blue diamond earrings for a couple of months. I was hesitant due to negative reviews. I'm so happy I took a chance on Katarina 1/2 ctw studs. They were well packaged so the inner gift box wasn't damaged (though I could see where the tag was removed from the bottom). Very nice inner box. I was thrilled when I opened the box! They are a lovely shade of deep (not dark/dull) blue. You do get very slight hit of green in lower light. Beautiful, true, brilliant cut, they relect the light & sparkle. Rated as I1. Under 60x magnification I can see the expected inclusions (very small!) but they are NOT naked eye noticeable. {I have a blue diamond ring with very tiny stones. Under magnification the inclusion are horrible & one even has a chunk out of the top table! They too were rated I1!} I feel the earrings I received were much nicer. They look great in my second ear pearcing, not too big, 1/4 ct each is just right for me. I do not believe I could have found a better deal or been more pleased with my purchase. If you are familiar with blue diamonds, you will be satisfied. As for the negative reviews, I would have contacted them & gotten a replacement. I also received an offer for liking them on facebook. I received the email for the credit the day before they arrived in the mail. Nice! The only thing I would want would be screw post/backs. Can't have everything for the price. I'm very happy with my purchase & would recommend them to anyone searching for affordable blue diamonds. Love 'em!

17503,"I've been wearing a Q-link pendant for several years, as has my husband. We feel better and more energetic from wearing them. When my chiropractor was performing muscle testing on me, he found that when I was wearing the Q-link it improved the results so much that it inadvertently masked a condition that I had and was being tested for. Now we make sure I remove the Q-link to get accurate muscle testing. This showed us the Q-link does make a positive difference.Another difference I noticed since wearing the Q-link pendant is that I can now shop in stores that have florescent lighting, whereas before I would get dizzy and disoriented, and would have to leave the store.

I no longer feel those palpitations. #3 My thoughts and speech are much clearer.

14734,"I've bought a lot of Peora jewelry for various relatives, and most of it has been very nice. This particular setting is excellent as it presents the stone very well so it shows up better than most pieces of this size. This setting also looks great with Swiss blue topaz.

19599,"I've found Moissanite indistinguishable from diamond in day-to-day wearing. I've researched diamond simulants and substitutes extensively over the last several months, and I don't believe the websites that claim that it chips easily and they had to sell diamonds to clients to replace them, as Moissanite's hardness is actually greater than sapphire at 9.25. Also, they claim that it has a greenish cast, but that's incorrect, too, from what I've seen. Maybe the early ones did, but the one I bought doesn't. It has more of a grayish cast, which is what actual diamonds have too. Moissanite does exhibit double refraction, but that's only visible under a microscope, no one can tell with it on your finger. The diamond vested interests must be really worried about Moissanite to resort to the sort of misinformation I saw, and for good reason. The price is one-tenth of what you'd pay for a two-carat diamond, and you can put the savings in the bank or invest it, which would be the smart thing to do, especially for a young couple.The diamond websites also claim that it's hard to find Moissanite with excellent clarity and lack of inclusions compared to the best diamonds, but still, even if true, you can't tell except under much higher magnification. Even an average quality 2 carat diamond is going to run around $12,000, but my Moissanite was only about $1400 even after taxes. The diamond websites I saw like to give you the impression that there's something wrong with Moissanite, but there's nothing wrong with having a ruby or sapphire or emerald, and as I said, Moissanite is actually slightly harder than sapphire at 9.25, and substantially harder than emerald, which is softer than sapphire at about 8.5. So really, it's like having a clear sapphire, but even harder, in terms of hardness and durability.Moissanite does have slightly higher light dispersion and refraction than diamond, but that just makes it look a bit more sparkly. It's not as dramatic a difference as cubic zirconia, which has much higher dispersion than diamond, and now I can tell the difference with cubic zirconia and diamond without much problem. But I don't think anyone but an expert, and maybe not even them, could tell with it just on your finger. I think they'd have to resort to the specialized tests. So overall, it's a great substitute for diamond that can save you many thousands of dollars, and I've been very happy with mine.

19741,"I've had many a pair of earrings over the years, but this pair has become my favorite. First, I love garnet. This one has a stone that is a little more orange than I would have liked, but it is neutral enough to go with just about everything I wear. Second, there is no substitute for gold, especially if you have sensitive skin, as I do. No more lobe irritation or having to quit wearing earrings for a couple of weeks at a time because the metal irritated my skin. These lovely gems are a delight. My favorite self-indulgence.

15549,"I've had one of these for years. I also have one in 14K gold from another source.They are very well made, and draw a lot of attention due to the nature of it's design.I would love to find another gold one, but they are tough to find these days.You definitely can't beat the price for this one.

18858,"i've had this ring almost a year now and still love it to death. i wear it everyday, it has never turned my finger green and i get compliments all the time. about a week ago a jewel came loose but you cant even tell, after almost a year thats great quality for the price.
",5
18303,"I've had this ring for a while now. I know some other people had a little trouble with the pearls falling out, but mine has been through a ton of hand washing (I'm obsessed,) a two year old throwing it across the room, and being slammed down on the counter frequently among other things. Bottom line: I have not been gentle with this ring and it has held up to all my abuses. Great ring! I can't wait to get the earrings.

18835,"I've had this ring for almost 8 months and love it. It's very pretty but also low maintenance. And as others have said, it's durable too. I hike and do lots of outdoor activities, and this ring has withstood a lot.

16186,"I've noticed some reviews stating these earrings were reminiscent of ""costume jewelry"". This is completely false. My mother, whom I purchased these for, had many genuine Swarovski crystal figurines in the house I grew up in. My sibling and I loved when the afternoon sun would light up the walls with rainbows refracting off the crystals. So, anyone familiar with crystals knows that light is an important factor in appreciating crystals. These earrings, when held in the light, are stunningly reflective and sooo pretty. They are still pretty when inside, but their true nature comes out when in the light.I'm very happy I purchased these for my mother this Mother's Day, and I will likely make purchases of other colors/styles of these earrings in the future. I recommend these for anyone desiring a pure, beautiful piece of jewelry..

Very nice piece to add to my ever-growing SS collection.

Perfect 14K yellow gold color, not brassy-looking at all like some gold is, they are the perfect size - 1"" in diameter. Well made, yet light in gram weight, the post snaps shut with a nice click and doesn't feel like they will easily come unsnapped. The hinge seems to be high-quality and strong too. They are the perfect earring for me.

16657,"I've read reviews that criticized these earrings because they are hollow, and because they are ""small.""If these earrings were solid, they would weigh a WHOLE LOT more, and would be painful on the earlobes. These are thin tubes, and are VERY lightweight. That is a Good Thing. No fine jewelry store would sell solid earrings of this cross-sectional diameter, because no woman would want to wear them (unless they served as gauges).These earrings are 1"" (25.4 mm) in diameter. Get a ruler and look at it before you order. Or get a compass (or circle template) and draw a 1"" diameter circle. That's the size of these earrings. Please don't complain (and deduct stars) because the earrings are exactly the same size as the description states. You should not criticize the product because you are too stupid to understand the description. There are smaller (approx. 1/2 inch) and larger (approx. 2 inches) products available in this same series from this same manufacturer.The packaging is a bit odd. There is an outer black box (with a folding flap) which holds an inner black hinged box with a blue satin tab to assist in opening. The inner box has a flap with slits to hold the earrings, but both earrings had worked themselves out of the slits during shipping, and it was not clear to me how they should be inserted (and I'm a mechanical engineer). I made something up, and my wife was quite pleased with the result.

16274,"I've read the reviews on these earrings and how they're good for special occasions. I wear them every day and haven't taken them off since I got them in the mail.

I'm planning to get them in a different color and other pieces to match.

At first I thought there's no way this thing would work but after using it for a few months I can honestly say this thing was worth every penny!! I put my wedding ring (eternity band) and engagement ring in this once a week and it cleans out all the hand lotion and debris that gets stuck under the stone.Since I never take my rings off when I wash my hands at work I also get a buildup of soap in my rings after a few days and this cleaner takes it all out.The highest setting is 8 minutes which is good but to get all the junk out I usually put it in for 3 cycles of 8 min which is easy since I normally do it when I'm cooking or reading.The only thing that isn't so great is that it makes a weird buzzing noise while cleaning but otherwise I totally recommend it.

At the beginning, it began to appear dirty after a couple of months so I took it to a local Kays jeweler and they cleaned it for free with just a silver cleaning wipe and I was very impressed with the results. I bought a case of my own wipes but haven't had to use a single one since. It has retained its shine very well. The original snake chain my boyfriend presented me with actually broke (the clasp malfunctioned) so I had to replace it. I really like the design of the heart pendant-- it is elegant, sophisticated, and modern all at once. My boyfriend and I sometimes disagree on style (I prefer more edgy styles while he is a bit more traditional) and sometimes have very differing opinions but we both love this pendant. This is definitely something that you can wear everyday and can dress it up or dress it down-- it is very versatile. I couldn't be more pleased with this pendant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone of any age for any occasion.

We purchased a chain too. The one she bought didn't come with a chain. For some reason while on amazon.com I decided to click on the jewelery icon on the amazon.com website in the upper left corner of the screen. I then typed in white and gold cross in the search area. Low and behold the exact cross that we purchased for $250 (including tax)was listed there. I looked at it. The measurements were the same and it had the same weight as the one we already bought and this one came with a chain. So we still couldn't believe it. I ordered the one from amazon.com. It came today. The 14k stamp was in the same spot, the back pattern was exactly the same. The bail was exactly the same. It's the exact same thing so we returned the other to the mall jewelry store. The chain that came with online was very fragile but at least it came with something. We got a heavier different chain with the excess money and we still have plenty to go out to dinner for Mom's birthday too! Now my mother is all set. She finally has her cross. She loves it and the chain too!

These earrings were on the first page of results and my daughter was in love with them. They were perfect and completely affordable. As a matter of fact, there were so affordable that she bought two pair-one for her friend and one for herself. I was skeptical at the price and did not expect a quality product for such a low cost.

18312,"My girlfriend had picked this ring out for her engagement ring. She loves pearls and sapphires so this a natural hit. We were concerned about other reviews about the pearls and sapphires falling out but also knew that they could be replaced in a pinch. There has been no problems thus far and she loves it so much that she has decided that this will also be her wedding ring. Very pleased overall.

(it would help me, at least, if they didn't list their sizes in mm - this is always hard for me to interpret.) great color, nice little stones that are nicely mounted in yellow gold - they look sharp, and look much more expensive than they were. i am very pleased with my purchase.

I thought I was supposed to get a free pair of earrings with the purchase and did not, so maybe I'm confusing this one with another one I looked at. All in all, very happy with the purchase.

13401,"My hubby is the BEST! Rather than just guessing, he likes to find out what I'd really like for my birthday, holidays, etc., so I thought I might like some new diamond studs (and blue ones caught my eye). After shopping around for about 3 weeks, I found these 1/2 carat blue diamond studs in 14K white gold at a very reasonable price. I didn't expect a whole lot, and frankly, I thought I would be disappointed in the color and the size - my current studs were very small (my choice as I'm very active) and I was sure the color would be very dark. I'm a picky person and we were prepared to ship them right back if they weren't satisfactory. However, when I opened the box, I was delighted to find the stones were a beautiful sea blue, very brilliant, and each stone was appeared to be a full 1/4 carat each. I love them!

18639,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas. I cried when I opened it. It came in a beautiful yet simple blue velvet box. My husband said he thought the chain was going to be longer, but that was just a miscalculation on his part. The chain is sturdy - my 2 1/2 year old loves to yank on it. I've worn it every day without taking it off since Christmas Day, 2007, and it is still shiny and sturdy. It is also a conversation piece - several friends and co-workers have commented on it. I work in a school and even my students have made nice comments about it (that's a lot coming from 4th and 5th graders!)I would recommend this necklace to anyone who is interested in having a familial piece. Truly lovely.

They're a good in-between size so they work for casual, office, or dress-up. I take them on and off daily and have had no trouble with the wire bending or breaking. I expect they can stand up to ordinary wear and tear. They arrived well packaged in an attractive velvet pouch.

",5
15136,"My wife asked for this for her birthday (8/2010). Here is her review:This chain is very nice, especially for the price and length and being nickel-free. I LOVE IT!!! It is a feminine thickness, delicate looking, yet sturdy.Unfortunately, the two pendants (filigree heart locket & marscarite watch) I had planned to switch off wearing with this chain are not this shiny and looked terrible with it due to the different finishes despite all three pieces being sterling silver.I like the 30-inch length for items to hang low and be tucked into a top. The filigree locket is used with essential oils on flannel for ""perfume"" and body heat helps it float around. The watch needs to be on a long enough chain in order for one to have maneuvering room to lift it and see the time. I ended up buying a stainless steel 30-inch chain that is serving these purposes and it matches the pendants instead of this pretty, delicate, yet strong chain.I've been wearing this chain without a pendant, though, over solid colored tops because it is so pretty and feminine. Eventually I will find the perfect pendant or charm for it.

12943,"No instructions! Hate that. Any way, it is a nice box, and it has an engraveable name plate. When you open it up and set the disk down. you have to make sure it is sitting on the center hole, and that the off center little knob is also through a hole. When you set down the ""needle"" it needs to be locked down. Has over the rainbow, silent night, jingle bells,etc... Very old fashioned, like it.

12815,"No other method for cleaning jewelry or other small metalic or plastic items will get the grime out of miniscule nooks and crannies like this ultrasonic marvel. In the past I used small brushes and tooth paste or liquid soap, but nothing beats the high frequency liquid vibrations to agitate away dirt. Now my wife's bright jewelry always looks pristine and beautiful.Highly recommended.
",5
19270,"NOPE, it won't hold small hoops, but it will give you room for your danglies and chandaliers and regular question-mark wires, and if they fall, they're still safe. Plus, keeps the dust and yuck off. Much, Much better than the fold out kind that makes your earrings go every where when you unfold it. I have cats and this keeps the earrings safe from becoming ""prey"" but also easily accessible early in the morning when I am under-caffeinated and clumsy. Yeah, I had to get another kind of rack for my hoops and I have a pretty box for my posts, but I have 2 of these for my bigguns and got rid of the the accordian-style one.

17097,"Not only is it simple enough a style for a guy, but its the perfect size to be a respectable pirate earring (I am a Will Turner >.>). While it is pure gold, it is quite hollow, which I suppose could be considered a Plus. I sleep shower and everything else with this earing on, so you can too ;)If you want a simple ""pirate like"" earing that you don't have to worry at all about, then buy this. This one is the right size (sadly this is not the first one on Amazon I tried).

15316,"Of all the Sajen rings I have (approx. 16), this is probably the most beautiful one I own. The stone is really unbelievable -- a very dark red -- and the faceting of the stone is spectacular. The silver of the ring is also exquisite, both in color and in its high polish. The silver is almost a white silver, it is that bright. And the weight of the ring is substantial; as with all Sajen rings, the band is very thick and sturdy. As for the design -- there are silver swirls not only on the band, but also on the vertical sides of the gemstone setting, which you cannot really see in the photo, but which is hinted at in the description. This ring is stunning enough for evening wear, yet it is such a neat size, you could easily wear it to the office.

12442,"Of the Kinkade pieces I purchased, this was the best music box. There is a sense of awe in the painting on the underside of the lid. The Nativity scene is intricate and reverent. It has an elegance about it that further complements the spiritual nature it portrays. I was VERY pleased with this piece. The sound is good and it plays the whole song unlike two others that just played one line over and over. A true Christmas collectible that you will glad to own or give to someone special.
",5
19341,"of this same style and I was way more then pleased. In fact, I was so happy that, right now, I'm purchasing a few more necklaces in simialar styles but with different semi-precious gems. the price is more then fair considering all the work that obviously had to go into construction of the piece.
",5
19788,"Oh well, I bought this earrings for myself because I am stressing out looking throughout the jewelry store and now I don't think I have to go all the way just to buy myself a nice and very elegant earrings!!! I really like it! This one is just right for affordable but quality earrings!!!
",5
13522,"Ok so they were not flawless but they were very bright and larger than I expected. I'm not an expert in diamonds but I know a little bit. The color and cut for the money was great. I bought this pair so I could remove one of the diamonds and replace a stone lost out of my girlfriends ring that I bought her last year. The jeweler wanted over $300.00 just for the stone. I said no way!!! This Diamond was a little larger than I expected or needed but the jeweler was able to fit it in the ring for pretty cheap since I bought the stone. The ring now looks great and I have an extra diamond post to give to someone - sometime.
",5
14991,"Ok! So here goes my first review and on jewelry. This was a gift along with the matching necklace for my boyfriend who tried on the same product at a farmer's market recently... this is stunning. I had to return it only because I miscalculated his wrist size. 9 is average I believe, nevertheless it was a nice weight without looking pimpish but enough 'pop' to notice a nice piece. LOVE it on him my only regret is why I never treat myself to such nice pieces. HA. Thanks, I will be back.
",5
16747,"Okay, I am allergic to almost everything. I was really nervous buying these online, because I was afraid I would get an allergic reaction. However, it's been several weeks now, and everything is great! Some reviewers have commented about them being too small, but I honestly think they are the perfect size for an every day earring. Trust me, they are not teeny tiny! If they were much bigger I think they would be uncomfortable. They are classy, elegant, simple, and totally hypoallergenic. Great deal for $65!

It sparkles awesome at night and the cut is perfect. I wear it on my Index finger as a cocktail ring, and my very picky sister actually loved it and was shocked that I found it on amazon.com for such a great price thru Palm beach jewlery they are a great company.

17844,"Omg, I just love these earrings. It's my birthstone month and they are gorgeous! I love how they sparkle. Shipping was great. I would definitely buy these again! Thanks Amazon!
",5
19756,"OMG, much more than i expected, so happy i took the word of the positive reviewers...had reservations about buying a second pair online, the previous pair, not from the amazon collection, stones were way smaller than i expected, backs were so small that once you dropped one it was gone, just too small to find, thats how i wound up buying this pair...what an absolute bargin these were, thank you amazon, first yes, the stones are lighter than the photo, for me i like the colored ice look they give, stones to me look 1/2 carat,reasonable amount of gold and the backs, though not as big as they were made many years ago, still they are adequate and bigger than the one i just lost.if you are on the fence about this one, i do not believe you will have any regrets if you do purchase them...

A friend of mine smacked my hand for whatever reason and it bent so I'll be ordering another one soon.. (along with two additional ones for my two best friends). It came in a nice little box with a bow on it. I've had it for over a year and wear it almost every day. (I'm not one for jewelry but I loved this ring). Great buy and I WILL be ordering from this company again. You see in the picture exactly what you get in the mail and for the price, you can't go wrong.

14046,"One problem I always have with pendants is that they tend to weigh down the chain into a ""V"" and then get stuck on a link and slip to one side or the other. This chain is thick and stiff enough to keep your pendants hanging straight. The stiffness also compliments more modern jewelry designs.

It came yesterday and I surprised my wife with the ring last night. She was as happy as the first time I gave her an engagement ring seven years ago. The moissanite solitaire shined and glows better than any diamond we have looked at. Went I told my wife it was moissanite instead of a diamond she did not believe me. When I told her the price, she did not believe me. She thought I paid twice the amount that I actually paid for it. The seller, Rich Peel Enterprise responded to my entire questions promptly. Plus the ring arrived two days earlier.

En especial cuando es joyeria o cosas de metal.ATENCION!!! No se confien este aparato que es para LIMPIAR y no para restaurar, Asi que si esta rayado - oxidado o gastado .... No esperen un milagro.

I've had it since 2007 and I alwas wear it not only on Halloween parties but almost all autumn time, as it reminds me of something mystic, warm, beautiful , about hidden miracles, about eternal love and many-many other associations. Besides of all that, this is the best halloween pumpkin pendant ever. I never found something(even just similar to it) like this again. I've got my silver jewerly halloween collection, this item was the first and by now I have all classic halloween symbols: a cat, a spiderweb(a ring), a witch(a ring), two small spiders, a bat.

The most hardened clogs require soaking and then a short cleaning in the machine, more soaking and then another cleaning. Even the hardest clogs are cleared.

15566,"Ruby is my birthstone. I've never had real rubies but always wanted some, so I took a chance on the one 5-star review that was already posted, as well as the bargain price. I'm so glad I did. These earrings are simply beautiful. They are tiny (be sure to check out the measurements listed), but you have to expect that for precious gems at this low price. They are still big enough to be seen and admired--I would call them a delicate size. They are subtly beautiful and perfect for my style, which is not flashy, garish, or look-at-me. As the description states, they are opaque, PINK-RED stones. The hinged lever-back clasps are sturdy and tight. I love the color--it's not quite fuchsia or magenta, but note that they are NOT PRIMARY RED. I'm using a Dell monitor, and the color is reproduced exactly on it. The center diamonds (diamond ""chips"" I believe) are minuscule but still add sparkle--the entire setting sparkles delightfully under incandescent lighting.

There are also beautiful variations of stones, pearls, and glass beads, all in different shapes and sizes, some are faceted and some are smooth. The total effect is that of a glittering golden/bronze/greenish hue that goes well with many colors in the wardrobe.

There is no bare metal at the back even though I purchased the 24 inch. That is probably the reason for the price increase as the length increases.

They catch the light and send beautiful sparkles out from the facets. I have since ordered another pair in another color.You cannot beat this quality for the price.

16463,"The earrings are very elegant and the absence of a visible hinge is wonderful. There are, however, minor discrepancies with them that, though they did not affect me, might be an issue for others.Things to take into account with these earrings before you purchase them:The hidden hinge is placed a little low so if you have small lobes or your hole is less than 3-4mm below your the top of your lobe, the top of the earring will come up above it. They fit perfectly for me, but every ear and piercing is different. MOST people will not have a problem with this, though.The post is not the typical rounded post wire. It is a rigid bar with a slightly larger size than post wires. Freshly pierced ears that have not stretched out a little may find this to be a tight fit at first, but it passes.Otherwise they are absolutely beautiful. Wonderful earrings.

In fact, when I received them 3 weeks ago I had been wearing them since then, never take them off. I have very sensitive ears and ALL my earrings cause irritation but not this ones - I'm impressed! And yes, you don't really feel them when you wear them to sleep. I paid 102 and IMO this is worthwhile. I'm looking for bigger hoop now in Amazon but have not set my eyes on ones yet.

Since then I have literally whacked it against many things and all the stones are still in tact, in the ring, and uncracked. More importantly, all the Marcasites are still in their respective spots as well! Usually when I get a ring with Marcasites inlaid, they fall out in quick succession, so i'm incredibly satisfied with this ring.

The picture does a good job of conveying the overall piece, but the color and brilliant luster of the pearls cannot be conveyed. Delivery was unexpectedly fast. It was definitely worth the money.

14814,"The online picture of this piece does not to it justice. The pieces of amber are raised adding dimension to the pendant. All of them are almost the same height except for one but it's hardly noticeable and I think that's what makes it unique. This pendant was unavailable right after I bought it so I think I got the last piece. For now I hope :) If it is back in stock I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves amber jewelry.

",5
14919,"The pendant of course comes with no chain. But most accompanying chains lack quality and are better replaced anyway so no loss in choosing your own to better compliment the main piece while not wearing the inclusion price for an inadequate one. So factor that in when weighing up the true cost.The craftsmanship (fine detail) is extremely well done right down to the fine head feathers of the Phoenix. Not too large or small (basically the disc size of the piece is that of tip of middle finger touching tip of thumb on an average sized person.You might feel a little disappointed upon initially opening the little bag the product comes in as mine looked quite a bit duller (a bit like stainless steel to be honest) than that depicted by Amazon which shines like a mirror. However - dont panic - a little silver polish gently applied and the true beauty of the piece will be revealed as the tarnish is wiped away. Pity the seller didnt do that before sending but then again...once the sale is made why fuss they probably thought.As gold becomes almost out of reach for a similar size product for most people, this piece is confirmation you can still catch the eye with that other precious metal ""Silver"" and receive praise for your taste. My wife has and so shall your lady friend. The matching - though smaller - earing set of the same design is recommended too for those who like a ""set"" within their collection.Highly recommended.

12831,"The ring came without delay. My only wish is that they came in half sizes. The orientation on the ring changes as you spin it. So it isn't always pointed in or out. Confusing if you are using it as a wedding/engagement ring. But I still love it.

While the black paint on the inside has already worn off, our daughter still loves it, and it actually looks almost nicer without it. She received the ring as a gift and rarely takes it off.

12349,"The ring is great for the price. Granted the rings are hollow, but then again they are 14k gold. Nonetheless, its impossible to find this style ring for this low a price. Hence it is quite the deal!
",5
12328,"The ring is great. The 6 mm being pretty wide, was easily scratched, but we got it changed for a thinner one of a larger size (as someone else already said, the ring runs small so order a size above what you would normally wear) and I mentioned that it had scratches. When the 5 mm came, it was perfect, and didn't look as bulky as the previous one, and had no scratches on it. I am happy to recommend this product, and its seller.
",5
16017,"The ring is much shinier and smoother than it looks in the picture. I was very impressed to get a ring of this quality for such a great price! I took the advice from other reviewers and ordered a 1/2 size larger than I thought I needed, and I'm very happy I did. It fits perfectly. Plus, with a band it's better to have it a little too big than too small because it doesn't matter if it spins around. Service from Sabrina Silver was excellent!
",5
12322,"The ring is perfect for what I wanted -- simple and elegant. The size is perfect for stacking with other band rings.
",5
15975,"The ring is perfect if you don't want anything too big or overbearing on your finger. I ordered the size 3 to use for a cute little pinky ring and it suits the use nicely.However, it's not as nicely polished as I'd hoped, but it will do fine.

",5
18827,"The ring itself was very nice. I liked it because it is a bit more unique than most wedding bands.Unfortunately, I had to return it for a different size since the size guide on the Amazon web site will not give you the correct size. DON'T USE IT. Go to a jeweler and get your finger measured if you don't know your ring size.I did reorder this ring in the correct size and I am very happy with it.
",5
18473,"The ring looks nice and is unique. It was what I was looking for, and the little gold box with bow packaging was a nice touch. I bought this ring for my boyfriend in February. He's worn it every day since then and it hasn't broken. I worried because some reviews for the other similar gemstone rings mentioned that they shatter. He wears it in a weird spot on the finger and it has flung off a few times but hasn't broken.

",5
19554,"The ring was a very nice purchase. It came in a relatively timely manner, and seems to be well-constructed. The metal is by no means ""thin"" or ""cheap"", and the stone seems to stay in place. It may be somewhat pricey with the shipping fees added on, but it is a great buy for a relatively inexpensive piece of jewelry that won't turn your finger green.I will keep in mind Silver Insanity should I decide to buy jewelry from Amazon in the future.

18096,"The sage silk strings beautifully hold each stone. The necklace sits snug just below the throat, somewhere closer to a choker than a hanging necklace. The color is a nice mixed hue of sage and forest. This necklace is very elegant with a hint of funkiness making it perfect for a formal or informal event. Comes in a beautifully wrapped box with a little booklet from the creator of this piece.

15018,"The stones are a slightly lighter color than they appear in the photograph, more of a wine color than a dark purple. The charm has great detail, the enamel shimmers. The whole piece attracts attention. One of my favorites.

",5
17640,"The talisman is great, I purchased in a store ""Essence of Tibet"" or something along those lines. The pewter metal encasing the design is nice, with a good weight and design on the back. The design is actually good enough to be worn in reverse, in my opinion. The front is comprised of brass and copper. There is a layer of copper covered by a brass layer which contains holes. These holes create the ""Wheel of Law"" design. I really do love the design, it's simple and subtle enough to be worn anywhere, but interesting enough to get compliments and gain interest from others. The chain serves its purpose. It doesn't perfectly compliment the talisman, but to be honest it's not that big of a deal. I am not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say it's not comfortable or that it turns your skin green. I find that it's comfortable enough to forget it's there and it certainly does not turn your skin green.If you read the title of this review you would notice that it says ""but may require some cleaning"". From the many reviews of this line of talismans and my personal experience, I have determined that the bronze is not protected by any lacquer or other clear sealant. Because of this, when exposed to air and moisture, the bronze will slowly tarnish. This is not really an issue though, because there are many ways to preserve and clean bronze. Just search ""clean bronze"".All in all, this talisman makes a great personal purchase or gift purchase. If giving one as a gift, look at the other talismans first to determine which one would be best for your friend. The Wheel of Law is a great choice though, because it is supposed to attract ""Health, Wealth, and Happiness"". You can't go wrong with that.

14761,"The vendor, through Amazon, is 'CoolStyle'. This was for a man's earring, and it was exactly what I was looking for. I searched the web for a several days looking at different vendors & styles. This one caught my eye immediately. The price seemed reasonable, compared to similar items. CoolStyle shipped it promptly, and the quality seems to be very good. The diamonds are very small - and that was exactly what I wanted - just a little bit of flash. A very nice touch is the brushed finish on the outside of the ring, while the sides are polished.BTW - I was a little nervous of the Safety Lock, but it seems to keep the earring very secure, and it is barely visible on the backside. I leave the earring on all the time, and it has never opened up on me.They also arrived with a nice polished wooden box (to keep my spare, as they come in a pair).

17102,"The weight of these are perfect and the clasps feel very secure. Nothing like the classic white gold hoop earrings.

15896,"There are plenty of anklets out there for the dainty and pixie footed. But God forbid your ankle exceed the 9 inch industry standard! This is not just a dreary queen-sized item however. This piece of jewelry is beautiful, intesterting and substantial - just like the woman who will wear it!
",5
18231,"There weren't many product reviews, when i ordered this so i was nervous. Upon receiving the pendant i was delighted to see that it was beautiful. The number was shiny, cleanly cut, and not too big or too small. It is functional for males and females.
",5
16996,"These 4mm ball stud earrings are very comfortable and easy to wear. They can be used everyday, or for an evening out. I have been wearing mine since I received them and do not even know I am wearing them. The back clasp is a bit small, so some may want to change them for a larger backing clasp. Overall I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice pair of ball stud earrings.
",5
16746,"These actually improved my allergic reaction from my previous earrings and now my ears are no longer swollen. If you're looking for some classic dainty earrings, I definitely recommend these. I especially like the closures since they're so easy to open and close; therefore, making it really easy to wear and take off. They're also very light and very bright. I'm really satisfied with my purchase and in love with these earrings.

",5
13543,"These are a great pair of lab ruby earrings. I really like the colour, more of a true red like the ruby ring I has as a child then most of the pinkish cast rubies you see today. The silver setting has nice detail and they have great swish. You probably won't make anyone who's stuck on price tags jealous, but they are beautiful and great at the price.
",5
13686,"These are a great pair of small, comfortable earrings that can be worn with casual or dressy atire. The latch to hook and lock them together works very well and is one of the better designs I've seen and used. I've worn them a few times already and have had no problems with them. I wish I would have gone ahead and gotten 2 pairs (knowing the way I go through earrings). You can't go wrong with these, they are small, yet not too small.
",5
19729,"These are a steal at $29. The stones are a decent size, with a nice, even color. They were perfectly matched, well-set, and have reasonably-sized backs. Don't hesitate to order them - you won't be disappointed.

13451,"These are absolutely beautiful earrings with lots of sparkle! I purchased the 1/2 ct blue earrings about a year ago and loved them so much that I bought these to go in the top hole of my ear. They are just a tiny bit darker than the picture shows but the picture doesn't capture the awesome sparkle. They go great with just about everything, especially jeans! Love em!

15030,"These are adorable little pouches and I bought them specifically for the small size. There are plenty of larger pouches out there that you can buy if you need more volume--the dimensions of these are clearly stated in the description.These make excellent gift pouches for jewelry and are a beautiful way to store and organize small things. I use them in my purse to organize coins, tissues, hair pins, etc. In fact, I keep running out and ordering more!

14758,"These are beautiful and beautifully made earrings. I found everything about them to be very fine. The metal has a beautiful finish, and the secure fastening is solid. The diamonds sparkle brightly and appear very colorless - however, they seem hardly bigger than pinpricks. You need to be fairly close-up to notice them. Overall, these earrings seem to be flawlessly constructed. Just be aware that they are petite.

",5
17855,"These are beautiful! I was very reluctant to order jewelry online, but these are so much more beautiful in person. The shine of the blue topaz is amazing.

12743,"These are exactly as described, although I thought that the ""solid gold bezel meant there would be solid gold on the back of the earring. The jade is set into the bezel and the bezel surrounds the jade heart. The quality of the gold and the jade are excellent.

16277,"These are exactly as I expected, not too big not too small. Fun earrings.
",5
17093,"These are exactly like the picture shows and are sturdy and simple - exactly what I was looking for. The clasp on one earring was a little tight fitting, but it loosened up after a few open and close motions -- I'd rather it be too tight than too loose and risk having the earring fall out.They are a great size - not too big and flashy, but as I said simple and clean. I wear them all the time now -- really pleased with them!

17225,"These are fantastic! Very pretty and lightweight. I also own the yellow gold pair of Duragold hoops that are about half the size of these and have been very happy with them. Have worn them 24 hours a day for about a year and they still look as beautiful as the day I got them. I am confident this pair will be just as durable.
",5
16933,"These are good quality gold earrings with a secure clasp. I really do not feel that they are large at all as one reviewer here states. They are more on the small size for what the styles are these days. I payed $80.UPDATE Jan. 2012:I have worn these nearly every day since purchase and they have worn beautifully and still look new.

17195,"These are gorgeous in person. Very easy to insert and they stay in. I can wear them with just about anything- they're the perfect size without being obtrusive.

",5
16670,"These are my first choice for earrings, just about every day. They are perfect for just about every situation. They aren't heavy, aren't too big, and aren't too small. They are never get lost under or get tangled in my hair, and my hair is pretty long. What is more classic than a modestly sized pair of hoop earrings? These fit the bill to a tee. I love them.

",5
16865,"These are nice little hoops, a little less than 1/2"" across. That may be too small for some but my wife (who hates large earrings and who has long dark hair) loves them. They look great on her and bonus points for me. They come in a small velvet bag which is held in turn by a small dark blue gift. This would be a nice gift for an adult or a child - as long as you read and understand the very accurate product description listed above.
",5
16951,"These are nice quality basic hoops. Fastening is secure and I must say I listen for the small click. They are an excellent size; seems like they are made to be of a slimmer tubing, but overall a fair size so they can be seen through long or short hair. They are light and comfortable to wear, and the gold is classy. Every earring person needs hoops and these will certainly get a lot of wear.

13702,"These are really nice for the price!! I was not expecting something that looks as nice for everyday wear, and for such a low price, even if I were to lose one, I would miss the earrings more than what I spent!! Highly recommended for someone who wants a simple little hoop with a bit of sparkle.

15839,"These are really pretty earrings. They are jewelry not just cheap junk. They are very light weight and the clips are greaT, they stay on without pinching. I can wear them all day and forget that they are on. These were well worth the price which I consider a bargin.

13404,"These are so fun and totally useful-just as good with jeans as with a nice dress. Agree with some of the other reviewers that the color is slightly different in person than how it shows in the photos, they are a little darker and the shade of blue has a little green in it, but it's a pretty color so I still heart them. And the price is awesome for real diamonds in a gold setting. Also, the gold is white gold, which is sooooo much nicer than yellow gold! Great job Katarina!!

15564,"These are so light you can hardly tell they're in and I get lots of compliments when I wear them. Very cute! The only downside is one of mine has an area where they were poorly put together and it tends to pinch me when I put it in. Once in, I really like them!
